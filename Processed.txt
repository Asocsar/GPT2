You've gotta love how New York and New Jersey played the old bait and switch with the federal government. An Obama-backed boondoggle was literally shut down with a scorching letter from the Trump administration calling out the two states for asking that the feds fund the initial stages of a 'local project' with government loans. Maybe NY Senator Chuck Schumer and NY Governor Cuomo should follow federal law on illegals, then maybe the feds would help him out...

Fox News reports:

An Obama-era plan to have the federal government finance half of a $13 billion rail tunnel project ran into a red light Friday from the Trump administration.

The plan, proposed under President Barack Obama in 2015, includes revitalizing a deteriorating Amtrak tunnel connecting New Jersey to New York City, repairing damage to a dual-tunnel conduit, and reconstructing the New Jersey railroad network's aging Portal Bridge, Crain's New York Business reported.

Amtrak, which owns most of the rail tunnels and tracks between Boston and Washington, D.C., contends that the existing tunnel connecting New Jersey and New York City is damaged and could fail within 10 to 15 years, threatening daily rail transportation in the Northeast.

The original Obama-era plan called for costs to be split among New York state, New Jersey and the federal government.

'A LOCAL PROJECT'?

But in a letter Friday, the Trump administration notified New York and New Jersey that the Obama-era deal was now "non-existent" because the states recently requested that their portions be covered by loans from the federal government — meaning Washington would supply all of the initial funding for what the Trump White House is calling "a local project."

"Your letter also references a non-existent '50/50′ agreement between USDOT, New York, and New Jersey. There is no such agreement," wrote K. Jane Williams, deputy administrator of the Federal Transit Administration. "We consider it unhelpful to reference a non-existent 'agreement' rather than directly address the responsibility for funding a local project where nine out of 10 passengers are local transit riders."

Governor Cuomo was angling for more federal funds way back in July of 2015:

Israel News reports:

New rail tunnels under the Hudson River are needed to reduce delays, but the expensive project won't work without a greater financial commitment from the federal government, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday.

The Democrat said Washington's proposal to cover $3 billion of the estimated $14 billion tunnel project isn't enough. He and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are expected to meet soon with federal officials to discuss funding for the stalled plan, which comes after a series of delays that underscored the age and condition of the area's transportation infrastructure.

"Everyone agrees that we need the tunnels," Cuomo said in a radio interview. "If the federal government can make a significant contribution, than let's go. We have the shovels. We need it. We'll make it a priority. But we need to fund it."

Isn't it funny how Cuomo has been defiant on following federal law on illegal aliens and now this...Perhaps being a sanctuary city has consequences...(What's happening with the Arkansas Razorbacks?

FAYETTEVILLE – It took a pair of strong performances from its stars and a furious late-game rally, but Arkansas stayed perfect at home Saturday.

Daryl Macon and Jaylen Barford combined to score 61 points and made several key plays to lift the Razorbacks to a 95-93 win over No. 19 Tennessee in front of a sellout crowd of 18,696 fans. They are now 8-0 at Bud Walton Arena this season.

The victory should be enough to vault Arkansas (11-2) into the AP top 25 for the first time in three years, as it was at the top of the "receiving votes" section entering the week.

"Coach doesn't want me to talk about that, but I have to say something," Macon said. "I thought we should have been ranked a long time ago, but sometimes you have to show people.

"I have no problem with showing people. I came the JUCO route, so I have no problem showing whoever in this country."

Tennessee (9-3) was in control for most of the game, even leading by as many as 10 points late in the first half.

Every time the Razorbacks tried to cut into that lead, they would shoot themselves in the foot and the Volunteers would make them pay for those mistakes.

For the first 38 minutes, Arkansas made just 2 of 11 shots and committed four turnovers when it was within three points or tied with Tennessee. On the flip side, the Volunteers shot 14 of 26 (53.8 percent) and had five offensive rebounds in those situations.

"I don't think it was nerves," Macon said. "I just think we were too giddy at the beginning of the game. We just had to settle down and remember that we just have to play ball."

With its bench contributing a season-low five points, Arkansas had to rely on its starters – primarily senior guards Barford, Macon and Anton Beard – on offense.

However, with less than four minutes remaining, Tennessee still led by eight. During the final media timeout, head coach Mike Anderson preached getting stops and his team never panicked, even when the deficit grew to nine immediately after the timeout.

"In practice, we work on three-minute periods like that, so it wasn't anything new to us," Macon said. "We just had to come together and get stops, get the right stops and keep it going."

Arlando Cook missed a free throw with 3:33 left and Tennessee – which had been getting late in the shot clock all game – attempted a three-pointer 10 seconds later. Barford came up with the rebound and threw it ahead to Macon for a fast-break three.

Barford stole the ensuing inbounds pass and Daniel Gafford put his missed layup back in to cut the deficit to three points. The Volunteers pushed it back out to five, but four straight points by Barford and a big dunk by Gafford gave Arkansas its first lead of the game with 45 seconds left.

That dunk gave the Razorbacks' 6-foot-11 freshman 15 points, only two of which came in the first half when he struggled against Tennessee's big men.

"It's just a learning process for Daniel," Barford said. "I know he struggled in the first half because he wasn't used to that physicality.

"He had (Grant) Williams and (Admiral) Schofield banging him, so it just took encouragement and keep pushing because he is a young freshman. He still wants to learn, too, so I think that second half he really helped us out a whole lot."

Tennessee had a chance to take the lead with 18 seconds remaining, but Jordan Bone – who came into the game shooting 84.4 percent from the free throw line – made only 1 of 2 after a foul by Beard. The game went to overtime tied 73-73 when Macon's last-second three-pointer was off the mark.

"There were a lot of big play situations in the game," Tennessee head coach Rick Barnes said. "I thought we had about a two-and-a-half to three-minute space where I didn't think we were really poised, executing and getting the ball in bounds where we knew what we wanted to do."

There was a brief back-and-forth at the beginning of the overtime period before Arkansas went on a 12-0 run to take an 11-point lead with 47 seconds left.

The Razorbacks made just enough free throws to survive a late barrage by the Volunteers. Macon scored 13 of their 22 points in the five-minute period, including a perfect 6 of 6 from the charity stripe. He finished with a career-high 33 points.

"That's Daryl Macon," Anderson said. "We've seen him do that. He's capable of doing that. I thought our guys did a good job of really going through him and some of it was in the open floor."

Barford also had a career high, scoring 28 points to go with his five rebounds, four assists and two steals. He was the only starter without a turnover, as well.

It is the first time Arkansas has ever had multiple players score at least 28 points in an SEC game and improves the Razorbacks' record to 32-21 when playing AP top-25 opponents as an unranked team at Bud Walton Arena.

"When you talk about going to that next level, you have to have guys that can make play," Anderson said. "It's good to see them be in position to make plays.

"We didn't have some of the other things going for us, but those guys, they have the confidence to go out and make plays. ... That makes a big, big difference."

Arkansas continues SEC play next week with a pair of road games. First up is a trip to Starkville, Miss., on Tuesday to play Mississippi State. Then the Razorbacks play at Auburn on Saturday.

Both of those teams went 11-1 in non-conference play and it will be Arkansas' first road games since getting blown out at Houston earlier this month.

"This is a different road game from the PK80 and Houston," Macon said. "This is an SEC road game, so it's going to be a lot tougher.

"One thing we have to do is just stay together on the road. We can't shy away from the moment."

As Michael Gehlken of the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported, the Raiders are "expected" to move on from Crabtree this offseason.

The Raiders are expected to move on from their wide receiver this offseason. There has been a measure of dysfunction behind the scenes of a 6-9 campaign that will conclude Sunday at the Los Angeles Chargers. Changes are coming, and sources have indicated those will include parting with a player whose production is not considered worth the baggage.

It's interesting to hear about the "baggage" that Gehlken mentions. Even still, the Raiders will be losing a big part of their offense should they choose to go this route, but also would free up over $7.68 million in cap space by doing so, per Over The Cap.

Crabtree has tallied 1,925 yards and 17 touchdowns over the past two full seasons while putting up 601 yards and eight touchdowns in 13 games so far this season.

If Crabtree is released, it likely either means that the team sees an expanded role for another wideout on their roster, or that they'll look to the draft or free agency to add a new face.

Go VIP! Get The Inside Scoop With VIP Access!In the past fifty years, the car crash death rate has dropped by nearly 80 percent in the United States. And one of the reasons for that drop has to do with the "accident report forms" that police officers fill out when they respond to a wreck. Officers use these forms to document the weather conditions, to draw a diagram of the accident, and to identify the collision's "primary cause."

For the more than 30,000 fatal car crashes that happen each year, information gathered on the side of the road goes from the accident report form into a federal database: the Fatality Analysis Reporting System.

Anyone can use this database. Car companies, safety advocates, and regulators comb through it constantly, looking for patterns that help them understand how and why people die in car wrecks. In turn, this information helps designers and engineers create safer vehicles and roadways. The data informs all kinds of design decisions around car safety — everything from speed limits to mandatory seat belts.

But this culture of heavily regulated, data-driven, auto-safety engineering did not always exist. In fact, for decades, automakers tried to keep data about car wrecks to themselves. They not only resisted making cars safer, they argued the very idea of a "safe car" was impossible.

In the early- to mid-20th century, car ads didn't emphasize a vehicle's safety features. Instead, they talked about "styling" and aesthetic details. A Chrysler safety director once compared cars to "women's hats," saying "they have to have special attractiveness, and sometimes they even compromise with function."

Meanwhile, within 25 years of the first known fatal collision, car crashes had become the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. But most of those deaths were blamed on "the nut behind the wheel." Public Service Announcements instructed people to watch out for other bad drivers on the road.

In other words: cars don't kill people — people kill people.

"The whole notion that the machine could have some sort of impact on the likelihood of you surviving a car crash wasn't even on the radar during the first half of the twentieth century," says Amy Gangloff, a historian who studies auto safety.

Forget seat belts and airbags — cars at this time had windshields made out of regular plate glass. If your head went through it, you could get stuck, with sharp shards of glass pressing into your neck.

But before someone could come up with a safer car, someone had to come up with the idea that cars could be safer — someone like Hugh DeHaven.

DeHaven flew with the Canadian Royal Flying Corps in World War One and suffered a terrible plane crash. His pancreas, kidneys, and gall bladder were all ruptured. Later, in the hospital, he concluded that a sharp knob on his safety belt had led to his stomach injuries. He started thinking that human beings could be more carefully packaged to minimize life-threatening injuries during collisions.

DeHaven started by crash-testing objects, dropping eggs onto padding from higher and higher heights. He found an egg could survive a one-hundred-foot fall, if it landed on a three-inch thick rubber mat.

Then he turned to human beings, tracking down the people behind actual newspaper headlines like "Girl Falls 10 Stories, Lives and Tells of It." He learned that people are just like eggs. We can survive seemingly unsurvivable collisions, if the impact is spread out over time and space.

This insight led DeHaven to the most prolific source of high-speed collisions: cars. He began calling hospitals, coroners, and police officers to compile data on car wrecks. Almost everyone thought he was nuts.

DeHaven's crazy theory was that what happened to people's bodies in a car crash was a predictable product of the cars' design. It seems so common sense now it's hard to even register it. But at the time it was a revolutionary idea. And in the 1940s and 50s, DeHaven would prove it was true.

In 1953, he partnered with the Indiana State Police for a year-long study — and with their photos and reports from doctors and coroners, he was able to isolate which parts of the car were the most dangerous in a crash. These were mainly things we don't think of now, like hard non-padded dashboards and steel knobs with sharp edges that would end up stuck in people's skulls.

In particular, he noticed that non-collapsible steering columns would frequently impale drivers during a collision. The solution was the collapsible steering column, a technology that has saved 79,989 lives as of 2012, according to one government study. That's more than anything except the seat belt.

But collapsible steering columns wouldn't become standard equipment until 1967, more than a decade after the results of DeHaven's Indiana study were published. Because car companies just did not want to deal with his findings.

"Car companies were very paranoid about having a discussion about safety in the 1950s. Because a discussion about safety was pretty much going to guarantee that people start thinking about the dangers of driving," says Amy Gangloff.

To force society to think about issues of cars and mortality would take more than academic research. It would take politics.

A woman named Joan Claybrook would eventually be in charge of auto safety for the entire United States — but in 1965 she was just a political novice. She'd come to Washington D.C. for the first time as a fellow for the American Political Science Association. She worked for a Congressman from Atlanta, Georgia who'd recently read "Unsafe at Any Speed" by a car-safety obsessed attorney named Ralph Nader.

The book took research by people like Hugh DeHaven and turned it into a scorching indictment of the auto industry. It showed car companies had actually patented a lot of important safety technologies — including the collapsible steering column — but they weren't using them.

Behind the scenes, Joan Claybrook worked with Ralph Nader on a bill to regulate the auto industry for the first time. This made the auto industry terrified. General Motors even hired an investigator to dig up dirt on Nader to discredit him. The investigators didn't find anything, but news of their investigation leaked to the public and ended up making the car industry look terrible. Nader became a national hero. The car companies had effectively helped to energize an auto safety movement in the U.S.

And that movement succeeded.

In September of 1966, President Lyndon Johnson addressed more than 200 guests at the White House Rose Garden, including Ralph Nader and the president of General Motors. He spoke about cars in the language of public health, using words like "epidemic" and "highway disease." He talked about how cars had killed more Americans than all the country's wars.

"In this age of space," President Johnson remarked, "we are getting plenty of information about how to send men into space and how to bring them home. Yet we don't know for certain whether more auto collisions are caused by faulty brakes, or by soft shoulders, or by drunk drivers, or even by the deer crossing a highway."

He then started signing bills like the Traffic Safety Act, which ensured safer cars and created what is known today as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This agency enacted federally-mandated safety measures and set up crash databases. Remarkably, that bill to create a powerful government agency that would regulate some of America's biggest companies, passed with nearly unanimous bipartisan support.

Technologies that were mandated in the 1960s (like seat belts and collapsible steering columns) are still saving thousands of lives each year. But the car crash death rate has continued to drop in part because of smaller, subtler design changes. To understand how those changes happen, we have to go back to the government databases.

Safety engineers like Matt Brumbelow, who works with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IHS), can sift through the databases to spot new problems to solve. Then car manufacturers can set up crash test experiments, analyze the results, and adjust their designs to make safer vehicles. Brumbelow says the databases are incredibly important. "They're really indispensable. Without real crash data we would just be guessing."

A few years back, the Centers for Disease Control put out a list of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. On the list are vaccines, fluoridated water, and motor vehicle safety. Decade after decade, cars keep getting safer because regulators, activists, and automobile engineers keep looking at how drivers get hurt and finding more things to improve. It's a never-ending process that always begins with data.

But it is not a universal process — it hasn't happened in all industries. While the odds of dying in a car crash have dropped by 80% since the 1960s, the odds of dying from a firearm have gone up.

In reading this, maybe you've been drawing parallels between car safety and gun safety. If so, you wouldn't be alone. When pundits get together to talk about the latest mass shooting, the comparison often comes up. We have rules for who can drive, and drinking ages that promote vehicular safety, in addition to incremental design improvements to cars and roadways.

Other pundits will rightly make the point that cars and guns are very different. One is designed to help a person get from point A to point B, and the other is specifically designed to injure or kill.

But to people in the public health field, that's beside the point. Guns are a major cause of death and injury. And whether or not those deaths and injuries are intentional, researchers want to know whether or not they're preventable. Could a change in gun design, ownership laws, or something else cut down on the more than 20,000 gun suicides and more than 10,000 gun homicides that happen each year?

Some experts think the first step could be to treat guns more like cars when it comes to research. For example, public health researcher Stephen Teret has called for creating something that does not currently exist: a comprehensive database of deaths, much like the "Fatality Analysis Reporting System" — but for guns instead of cars.

"I want to be able to study gun deaths the same as we study heart disease," says Teret, "the same as we study cancer, the same as we study motor vehicle deaths, so we can reduce those deaths."

In the 1980s, Teret used government crash data to look at airbags and child restraint laws. But then he shifted his focus to guns and the difference was stark. Instead of just downloading government data, he had to gather his own from coroners and police departments — much like Hugh DeHaven once had to do. It was hard, expensive, and some information (like specifics about the guns used in fatal shootings) he just couldn't get. "There's been a culture that's built up around guns of not collecting information," notes Teret, "whereas the exact opposite has occurred with regard to cars."

For every chapter in the history of auto safety there is an opposing chapter in the history of gun safety, generally written with the help of the National Rifle Association (NRA). Where advocates of auto safety sued car companies, advocates of gun rights have made it nearly impossible to sue gunmakers; Congress created a registry of drivers, and then made it illegal to create a registry of gun-owners. And for each of the hundreds of millions of dollars the federal government spends on auto safety research each year, gun violence research gets pennies.

Stephen Teret knows all of this, but remains hopeful, in part thanks to a long history of public health improvements that were successful after initial periods of failure. He points out that it took more than 50 years to really reduce smoking in this country, for instance. And even the history of car safety, which seemed to move so fast in the 1960s, had decades where there were nothing but setbacks. Progress in public health just takes a really long time.

"There's hardly any examples where in public health where someone came up with an idea, everyone rallied around the flag saying that's a wonderful idea, let's implement it immediately. That's not how it works," Teret says.

Instead, it's a fight — to collect the data, to identify what we can change, and, finally, to make the many small, incremental modifications that eventually save tens of thousands of lives.2017 was an incredibly active year for Apple retail, as the company's refreshed store design continued its rollout across the world. As the calendar comes to a close, let's take a look at every store location opened under the guidance of Apple's retail chief Angela Ahrendts.

Boardroom Fixtures

Apple stores in 2017 could be described as taller, brighter, and more open. First previewed and later rolled out in 2015, the company's new retail architecture style was directly influenced by design chief Jony Ive. Since then, Apple has swiftly and methodically begun to remodel or replace each and every one of their retail locations with a consistent design language.

Heavily borrowing from the architecture of Apple Park, new Apple stores feature brighter, taller ceilings, terrazzo flooring, ambient "True Tone" ceiling lights, and stone walls and facades in favor of the former stainless steel sheeting.

Gone is the traditional Genius Bar and gigantic glowing Apple logos, replaced with more subtle branding and massive displays bordering "Genius Groves" used during Today At Apple events. These new stores have been described by Angela Ahrendts as "Town Squares," and they do indeed feel more open – and more luxurious too.

January

January 20th: 2017 began with the temporary closure of Apple's iconic Fifth Avenue store in New York City for significant renovations. In the interim, Apple moved operations to a storefront directly behind the glass cube, a former FAO Schwarz retail space. While impressive in its own right, the temporary store will be dismantled when the cube reopens.

January 21st: Apple's expansion in China brought a stunning Kunming store in the upscale Shuncheng Shopping Center. The entryway's round lobby and flat roof are reminiscent of the Steve Jobs Theater.

January 28th: Apple's new MarketStreet location opened in Lynnfield MA, replacing a previous aging store located in the Northshore Mall.

January also saw the closure of two of three Apple Watch shops at Galeries Lafayette in Paris and Selfridges in London. These pop up stores were unique locations that dealt with Apple Watch exclusively and boasted impressive window displays at launch. Recently, Apple removed the webpage for the final Apple Watch shop at Isetan Shinjuku in Japan.

March

March 4th: Replacing a smaller storefront in the same mall, Apple Pentagon City reopened in Arlington, VA.

March 11th: Apple St. Johns Town Center relocated to a larger, but shorter space in the open-air mall in Jacksonville, FL.

March 25th: A trio of stores opened on the same day in the United States, Germany, and China.

While many entirely new Apple stores opt for outdoor settings, Apple Brickell City Center chose Miami's luxury indoor shopping destination.

Apple Nanjing Jinmao Place became China's first retail location in the Gulou District.

Apple Schildergasse repurposed a historic German storefront while preserving many of the building's exterior details.

April

April 8th: Significantly larger than its predecessor in the same mall, Apple Woodland in Kentwood, MI reopened after renovation.

April 13th: Apple Avalon in Georgia opened as another entirely new structure, replacing a nearby indoor store in the North Point Mall. The building's profile is consistent with Apple Stanford, but the interior features a more modern layout.

April 27th: Marking a major milestone in retail architecture, Apple opened their flagship store in the Dubai Mall. The location was designed by Foster + Partners, the same firm responsible for Apple Park.

May

May 20th: Apple Providence Place in Rhode Island celebrated a grand reopening after expanding significantly. The new store features large, rotating glass panes that are functionally different, but visually similar to the solar wings used at the Dubai Mall location.

May 26th: The multi-story Apple Orchard Road is the company's first store in Singapore, and previews many design elements later found at Apple Park, including a custom staircase with a carved hand rail.

July

July 1st: Apple's first location in Taiwan opens as Apple Taipei 101.

July 8th: Apple Danbury Fair Mall reopened in the same shopping center in Danbury, CT, but with significantly more floor space.

On the same day, Apple CambridgeSide in Massachusetts celebrated its grand reopening, replacing one of the few remaining black storefronts Apple used on early stores.

July 30th: Apple Bluewater in Greenhithe, UK closed for renovations. The store will likely reopen in 2018.

August

August 12th: A duo of stores celebrated grand openings. The first was Apple Southhampton, previously known as Apple WestQuay. The new indoor space replaced one of Apple's tiniest storefronts in England.

Meanwhile in Wisconsin, Apple Hilldale opened, relocating from an indoor location at the West Towne Mall in Madison. We took an in-depth look at the store just after opening.

September

September 2nd: The month kicked off with the reopening of Apple South Hills Village, located in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, PA.

On the same day, Apple Village Pointe in Omaha, NE reopened in a new storefront at the same mall. Its design is almost identical to the aforementioned Apple Hilldale.

September 9th: Apple Northbrook, another indoor mall location in Illinois, doubled in size.

September 15th: While September saw a unusually high number of store openings, it also saw a permanent store closure. Apple Simi Valley closed its doors on September 15th, and unlike other store closures, no new replacement location or remodeling project followed.

September 16th: Apple Tianyi Square marked China's third entirely new location for 2017.

On the same day, Apple Topanga in Canoga Park, CA reopened after remodeling its existing space.

The third store to celebrate its opening on the same day was Apple Summit Sierra in Reno, NV.

September 22nd: Just in time for the launch of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, two updated locations welcomed customers, the first being Apple Meadowhall in Sheffield, England.

The second, Apple Smith Haven is also a relocation within the same building in Lake Grove, NY.

September 30th: Closing out the month of September was the grand reopening of Apple Woodfield in Schaumburg, IL. This location is one of Apple's oldest, originally opening in August 2001 as store number 5.

October

October 20th: Perhaps the most dramatic new store open of 2017 was that of Apple Michigan Avenue, Chicago's newest flagship location. 9to5Mac attended the opening, which drew large crowds and a visit from Apple executives. The new store on Chicago's riverfront replaced a unique stone storefront just a few blocks away.

November

November 3rd: Apple Century City in Los Angeles, CA reopened on iPhone X launch day, giving customers two reasons to check out the new store.

November 11th: An entirely new structure, Apple Domain NORTHSIDE replaced a significantly smaller and more enclosed location in The Domain shopping center in Austin, TX.

November 16th: Apple UTC's reopening in San Diego, CA kicked off a three-day store opening spree across the United States.

November 17th: Apple Park Visitor Center in Cupertino, CA welcomed the general public for the first time. Adjacent to the new Apple Park office complex, the visitor center offers rooftop views of the campus, as well as exclusive merchandise. It is also the only Apple store to feature a Caffè Macs. Another first for the company's hometown location is a massive 8K display, located centrally in the store's Forum area. Previous Apple Stores featured lower resolution 6K displays.

We visited Apple Park's Visitor Center on opening day and toured the store, which includes a special augmented reality experience.

November 18th: Apple Burlingame, near Apple Park's Visitor Center, reopened after a floor-to-ceiling remodel. We attended the grand opening and brought you in-depth photos of the new store.

On the same day, Apple Burlington reopened in Massachusetts. Alongside Apple Park Visitor Center and Apple Burlingame, this location was among the first to implement tables with more subtle charging systems.

November 24th: Austrialians patiently waiting since 2015 for next generation stores to arrive got their wish when Apple Chadstone reopened in a suburb of Melbourne.

November 25th: Apple Shibuya, a location in Tokyo, Japan closed for renovations. The store will likely reopen in 2018.

December

December 2nd: Embracing a dramatic, googie-esque streamlined design not found in any of the company's other stores, Apple Downtown Brooklyn opened in New York. Considering how significant the store's architecture is, opening day was celebrated with little fanfare.

December 9th: Apple Crabtree Valley Mall remained a second-floor location upon reopening in Raleigh, NC.

December 16th: Apple The Gardens Mall in Palm Beach Gardens, FL reopened in what is now the company's "standard" layout for mall stores.

2018

Apple retail leaves 2017 with 499 store locations, and the company shows no sign of slowing momentum as we enter 2018. Already, residents of Vienna, Austria are getting ready for a flagship store of their own. Across the globe, Apple has indicated plans for new locations in South Korea, Thailand, Australia, and Saudi Arabia. In India, the company continues to seek approval to open stores, and has finally received approval in the U.S. for a landmark location in Washington D.C.'s Carnegie Library.

In terms of architecture, attention to detail, and scale, each new store seems to surpass the last. It'll be fun to see the locations arriving in the new year.

Written & Storyboarded by: Thomas Wellmann & Jesse Moynihan

UPDATE: I was informed this one was actually storyboarded by Thomas Wellman, instead of Ako Castuera. This post was updated for accuracy.

PB's remained mostly in the background of the first half of season five. Despite having plenty of minor appearance here and there, and appearing as a major player during the guest animated episode A Glitch is a Glitch, there hasn't really been anything new or telling about her character that season four so seamlessly pulled off. The Suitor takes PB back to the spotlight, revolving around the status of her love life while also introducing a likable newcomer. It's an interesting tale of love and patience, and for what this one was going for, I think they pulled it off greatly.

I especially love the beginning, and any other moments that revolve around Peppermint Butler's dark deeds with the demon Ogdoad. Prior to this episode, we've only ever seen hints and allusions to Pepbut's ominous nature, though this one really kicks off his strange behavior by having him summon a demon in the first 10 seconds of the episode. And I love the way it's stage: the guardian angel from Dungeon is there, as well as animals that look menacing and starved, with a clueless Cinnamon Bun at the center of it all. It's just the kind of delicious obtuse behavior that I wanted to see from the little peppermint man. What's also tons of fun is watching him interact with the Gumball Guardian. The Guardian has never really been given a solid personality aside from the fact that he puts his all into protecting the kingdom. Here, he acts like an actual guardian of the princess and of the kingdom, which is a pretty interesting dynamic they chose to work with. He goes from a subservient assistant to an overprotective parent of the princess. I especially enjoy his line, "the Candy Kingdom worries for its leader, and it worries for you, dark one." The bickering between the Gumball Guardian and Peppermint Butler is a lot of fun throughout the entirety of the episode, and I wish we could see more instances of it in subsequent episodes. I can think of a few of the comics, namely Issue #11 of the Adventure Time Comics series where this dynamic is brought back, but aside from that, this is the only in-universe instance.

The suitors who have been waiting for a countless amount of years once again pose the interesting query of "just how fucking old is PB?" which once again is glanced over with subtlety. It's where we're introduced to Braco, the main protagonist of the episode. As far as Braco goes, he's pretty likable; I enjoy how the episode goes to great lengths to kind of make him seem pathetic and obsessive, yet still make him kind of rootable. I admire him for all the death-defying stunts he'll put himself through just for PB's affection, even if it is foolhardy at best. But most interesting is that, while I do root for Braco in this one, it is pretty obvious that he doesn't actually love Bubblegum, and the show knows that. When he's first introduced to PB, she immediately acknowledges that he's "infatuated" with her, and his only feelings of love for her come from a relationship that he's created inside his mind. I think most people can relate to this – I know I can – and I think the episode and the direction of the writing is smart for not treating this like any typical love story. It acknowledges that, while Braco probably does have some real feelings for the princess, he's more lonely and naive about love than anything, and instead is looking to fill that void and desire with fabricated tales of true love that he's convinced himself of.

These stories can sometimes be insufferable with just how much of an awkward doofus the hopeless romantic can be; Jamie's first appearance in Steven Universe definitely comes to mind. Yet, I find that, while there are a couple of instances where Braco is portrayed as an awkward doofus, he's still fun to watch and actually a pretty poignant character throughout the episode's run. I like his little observatory where he writes in his journal and documents his feelings, and I think it's pretty sweet that he turned to his late grandfather for tips on how to win a girl's love, even if it failed miserably. And okay, how long ago did this guy die?? Jake's been alive for what, 14 human years, and were supposed to believe that at some point he wrote this book under an alternative ego that was the key to Braco's grandad's luck with the ladies?? It makes no sense! It's by all means something that only I'm confused about and no one else is, but still! J.T. Doggzone will never fail to flabbergast me.

Finn's brief bit in the episode is something I do find really interesting, mainly because he's totally jealous. It's already been pretty well established that Finn isn't totally over PB at all, so watching him somewhat unsuccessfully try and act like he doesn't care was really quite telling of where he is in his developmental stage. And I'm glad they kept Finn's jealousy to a minimum; had it take up the course of an entire episode, it might've been frustrating and a bit unlikable, but here we just get a brief 30 seconds of Finn trying to pull off a farce and then smack talking Braco for a bit. It's a bit petty of him, but he's a 14-year-old boy with hormonal imbalances. I'm actually surprised he turned out this well. I also love his brief bit of nihilistic wisdom to Braco, "the path you're on leads to nowhere," which also includes Finn allowing Braco to take on the task. I dunno what Finn's intentions were; it could be that he knew Braco wasn't going to get anywhere, but let him go on the quest for shits and giggles, or that he actually wanted to see Braco succeed where he failed. I'd lean more toward the first option, though I wouldn't be completely opposed to the second either. I also like how they're able to incorporate Jake into these bits exceptionally well. Jake doesn't even have a line, though his facial reactions to Finn's uncomfortable behavior are just terrific. I love how he's somewhat skeptical about Finn, while also simultaneously concerned for him.

The task for the soul stone is a very neat one. Vapor Swamps is a pretty dope looking landscape, with hints that an old city once existed there. The swamp monsters are also pretty visually interesting. They all have a sort of Muppet look to them, which makes them feel straight out of Labrynth or The Dark Crystal. The Beast is especially cool, though I can't think of that name without immediately imagining Over the Garden Wall. The way Braco reasons with the Beast about his love for Bubblegum seems like it's going in the direction where he's just going to get beat up and suffer more, though I enjoy how the Beast actually lets him go because of it. Wonder what that fuzzy monster's backstory is.

Though Braco goes through a decent amount of pain throughout this one, it never feels mean-spirited or like it's mistreating Braco. He willingly puts himself into situations that aren't meant for him to be apart of, and instead of just sitting back and being patient, he instead throws himself into instant suffering. The epitome of his pain comes from when Peppermint Butler strikes a deal with Ogdoad to make Braco a walking love magnet. What I really like about the revelations surrounding Pepbut in this one is that it's made very obvious that, while he has a fascination with dark magic, he's still just kind of a cool guy who puts his loyalty towards PB before anything else. I think people had in their minds that Peppermint Butler was going to be one of the big bads at the end of the series that would take on the role of main villain, though I think that's somewhat against his character. He's perfectly conscious of his dark habits, and though it can stray in a path of borderline menacing at times, he still would never put the princess or her kingdom in a state of jeopardy. He's Peppermint "Butler", after all.

Braco pays the ultimate price for love, and ultimately, it still doesn't win over the princess. It's another great step in the lesson of not sacrificing yourself or your dignity for the love of another person, because 9/10, that person still isn't going to come around. But, through all the mental and physical pain he endures, he still gets a PB robot that he can fuck all he likes for the rest of his life. Yippee!

I've kept quiet about PB's actual depiction in this one on purpose, mostly 'cause I wanted to save it for last. I think she's portrayed quite perfectly in this one! While I'm sure some people have targeted her for supposedly being unlikable and putting Braco through hurdles of pain, that's not what I got at all from this one. Again, everything Braco did was completely against what PB wanted. She gave the task to find the soul stone to Finn and Jake, who she knew would be able to grab it without a problem. Braco took on the task without having the prowess or keen sense of heroism that the two boys had, and suffered for it. PB also had no idea that Braco was going to completely distort his appearance for her love, which again, was his own choice. She devoted all of her energy and science to creating what Braco wanted most, and if that isn't some enlightening motherly attention, I don't know what is.

I think the episode does a great job at showing her stress and isolation. She has to consistently focus her attention on running an entire kingdom (all while taking care of a caged Phil) and the idea of sacrificing her kingdom for romance just isn't strategically possible for her. I get the feeling that, from the last scene, she did have feelings for Braco that went beyond just caring for him as a Candy Person. She probably saw potential in him that she saw in any former love interest, though she knew she couldn't act on it because "responsibility demands sacrifice." We were all expecting a sad ending from Braco, but I think in the end, I mostly feel bad for PB. She wants to be carefree, giddy, and naive like Braco once was, but her impact on her kingdom and her people is unfortunately more of a priority for her. Though I doubt anything hurt as much as Peppermint Butler's bitch-slap. Man, was that hilarious.

So yeah, I think this one's pretty great. Really nice characterization of each of the characters that are focused on, and just some all around solid writing from Jesse Moynihan and Thomas Wellmann. You can really tell that they have a pretty deep understanding of unrequited love and infatuation, and it really shines through in this episode. This one also features a special outro, written and sung by Moynihan, with backup vocals by Ako Castuera. It's a really nice tune, check it out here if you haven't before.

Favorite line: "Well, you paid the price, no doubt, and I wanna have your babies.""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"

Sound will not work on mobile.Volunteers could be deployed to help plug gaps in the UK's Border Force, which has undergone drastic cuts under successive Conservative-led governments.

The plan, similar to the use of special constables in the police, is being considered in Whitehall. Critics, however, say doing so would be risky and caution against using a "Dad's Army" to guard Britain's frontiers.

Under the proposal, teams of volunteers would be used to bolster staffing levels at the Border Force, which manages immigration and customs controls. The government stressed that involving volunteers in immigration enforcement was not under discussion.

Concerns have been raised in recent years about the coverage of dozens of minor harbours and landing places in the UK. "Small ports and airfields are a known security weakness in our border security, so it's important to ensure that security is stepped up, particularly to stop illegal immigrants and returning Isis fighters," said Charlie Elphicke, the MP for Dover.

But he told the Mail on Sunday: "Border security is a skilled job, which takes many years of training. I would urge great caution before seeking to adopt a model like that used by the police, with special constables. We can't have a Dad's Army-type of set-up."

Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs the parliamentary home affairs select committee, told the paper: "Filling the gaps with volunteers because of budget and staffing cuts raises very serious questions about border security and the Home Office commitment to this important public service."

Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the PCS union, which represents many of the Border Force's 8,000 staff, expressed concern about the plan and accused the government of "making our borders weaker with the use of casual labour". He said it was "risking this country's security on the cheap".

"In the last year, the Home Office have increased the use of agency staff, spending a staggering £25m last year to agency firms, a £5m increase on the previous year," he said.

"Border Force are already using poorly trained seasonal workers at most ports and airports, not just at peak periods but throughout the year because of permanent staff cuts. The plans to use volunteer Border Force specials is a further move towards casualisation of the workforce.

"Government rhetoric has claimed that they are 'strong and stable'. That is not the effect of their policies on this country."

An inspection published earlier this year of 62 ports, wharves, marinas and jetties on the east coast that were normally unmanned found Border Force officers had not been to 27 of the sites during the 15 months from April 2015 to June 2016.

The assessment said one of the risks of long periods of non-attendance was that there was "no visible deterrent to anyone prepared to risk using these spots to land illegal migrants or contraband".

In a separate report, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation David Anderson QC also flagged up coverage of smaller south and east coast ports, marinas and landing places, saying it was conceivable they might be an option for returning foreign fighters or other terrorists.

The Home Office said the Border Force had a good record and that the government was committed to ensuring that it had the necessary resources. "We will never compromise the security of our borders," a spokesman said.The Latest: Colorado gunman ID'd as US veteran with a grudge

DENVER (AP) — The Latest on shooting in suburban Denver that left one sheriff's deputy dead and four deputies and two civilians wounded (all times local):

5:15 p.m.

A man identified by a law enforcement official as the gunman who killed a suburban Denver sheriff's deputy and wounded four others early Sunday posted repeated online rants against law enforcement in the area.

The law enforcement official told The Associated Press that Matthew Riehl was the man who shot the five deputies and two civilians as the officers responded to a complaint at the apartment in Douglas County. The official had been briefed on the investigation but spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly.

A YouTube user identified as Matthew Riehl posted a YouTube video Dec. 13 calling for the firing of Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock and railing against him in highly personal terms. Riehl wears an Iraq combat veteran hat in the post; a National Guard spokeswoman told KUSA-TV that Riehl served briefly in Iraq.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina Democrats say they are beginning 2018 energized and intent on regaining their historical control of the state's General Assembly, harnessing anger over Republican Donald Trump's presidency and buoyed by Democratic victories elsewhere.

Eager to reassert their longtime influence on North Carolina politics, the Democrats already have already fielded an unusually large pool of candidates for 100 seats in the 170-member bicameral legislature. Though official candidate filing doesn't start until mid-February, the Democrats are quickly approaching the number of House and Senate seats they contested in 2016 and hope to strongly contest each seat in November.

Republicans used a similar full-court candidate strategy in 2010 to seize control of both chambers for the first time in 140 years. They've held veto-proof majorities since 2013, allowing them to impose a right-leaning agenda including broad tax cuts, abortion restrictions and taxpayer-funded grants for children to attend private schools. They also passed the state's "bathroom bill," later partially repealed. While Democrats regained a bully pulpit when Gov. Roy Cooper narrowly defeated GOP incumbent Pat McCrory in 2016, they've still been unable to stop the GOP agenda because most of the Democratic governor's vetoes were overridden.

Republicans, well-honed in their own campaign operations, acknowledge the Democrats' momentum but point out November is months away. They say their record of cutting taxes and regulations has paid dividends through economic growth and low jobless rates. But that's not deterring newcomers, who are raising their hands for the Democrats well before all 50 Senate seats and all 120 House seats go up for grabs Nov. 6.

The 2016 election, including Trump's victory, "was pretty much a wake-up call and I just could not rely on other people to represent what I think is important," said Terri LeGrand, a first-time state House candidate from Winston-Salem. "The current leadership in Raleigh has had the wrong priorities on lowering taxes, instead of investing in the future." While Trump won the South in 2016 save for Virginia, his margin over Hillary Clinton in North Carolina was less than 4 percentage points.

Cooper has been raising funds for Democratic attempts to win back both chambers by 2020. The state's party is optimistic: Democrats surged in neighboring Virginia's state House races in November, erasing a large GOP majority. He predicted in an interview with The Associated Press there will be a similar Democratic surge next November, bring about a "more balanced legislature and thus better government."

"People are frustrated with the Republican leadership in the North Carolina General Assembly, they're frustrated with the administration in Washington and they're ready for candidates who care about education and health care and the middle class," Cooper said.

With the GOP holding a 75-45 majority in the North Carolina House and 35-15 Senate advantage, Democrats would need to flip 16 House seats and 11 Senate seats in November to take back the General Assembly. Ending veto-proof majorities, which would force Republicans to negotiate with Cooper and some Democrats on some issues, would require only four House seats or six Senate seats. All legislators serve two-year terms.

Rep. Graig Meyer of Orange County said the party is well on its way to fielding candidates for all 120 House seats. "Recruitments definitely got easier after Virginia," said Meyer, who is helping to recruit candidates like LeGrand through the state party's new "Pipeline Project." Meyer and others have highlighted new female and LGBT candidates.

But Republicans say they'll also have a strong field — and a strong record to run on.

"By the time we get to filing we'll have a number of good candidates all across the board," promised GOP Rep. John Szoka of Cumberland County, who is recruiting House Republican candidates. "What we have to offer the electorate is not rhetoric, but results."

Senate leader Phil Berger anticipates Republicans will retain their veto-proof majority in his chamber. "North Carolina is not Virginia," he added, pointing to more favorable Senate districts where Trump won in 2016.

North Carolina's 13 U.S. House seats are also on the November ballots, but no U.S. Senate that would otherwise bring in tens of millions of dollars in campaign ads statewide.

North Carolina political consultants from both parties said in interviews that 2018 election outcomes will rest on registered unaffiliated voters. In 2017, that group became the state's second largest voter bloc, surpassing Republicans. Democrats still remain at the top, though their share has fallen of late.

Dr. Rick Foulke of Waxhaw, a retired oncologist and another first-time state House candidate, knows what it's like to be an unaffiliated voter. He was one until he switched his registration to a Democrat amid unhappiness with Republican lawmakers, particularly on redistricting favoring the GOP and their refusal to expand Medicaid to the state's working poor.

Those and other Republican policies "got me off the sidelines and persuaded me that I really need to be in this fight," Foulke said.FILE - A Tuesday Oct. 17, 2017 file photo showing candles, notes and paper cuttings next to the Love Monument in St. Julian, Malta, the day after the killing of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.

BRUSSELS (AP) — At least 81 reporters were killed doing their jobs this year, while violence and harassment against media staff has skyrocketed, the world's biggest journalists' organization says.

In its annual "Kill Report," seen by The Associated Press, the International Federation of Journalists said the reporters lost their lives in targeted killings, car bomb attacks and crossfire incidents around the world.

More than 250 journalists were in prison in 2017.

The number of deaths as of Dec. 29 was the lowest in a decade, down from 93 in 2016. The largest number were killed in Mexico, but many also died in conflict zones in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.

The IFJ suspected but could not officially confirm that at least one other journalist was killed Thursday in an attack by an Islamic State suicide bomber on a Shiite cultural center in Kabul, in which at least 41 people died.

IFJ President Philippe Leruth said that while the drop in deaths "represents a downward trend, the levels of violence in journalism remain unacceptably high."

He said the IFJ finds it "most disturbing that this decrease cannot be linked to any measure by governments to tackle the impunity for these crimes."

Eight women journalists were killed, two in European democracies — Kim Wall in Denmark, who died on the submarine of an inventor she was writing about, and Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia who was blown up by a bomb placed in her car.

Beyond the deaths, the IFJ warned that "unprecedented numbers of journalists were jailed, forced to flee, that self-censorship was widespread and that impunity for the killings, harassment, attacks and threats against independent journalism was running at epidemic levels."

Turkey, where official pressure on the media has been ramped up since a failed coup attempt in July 2016, is becoming notorious for putting reporters behind bars. Some 160 journalists are jailed in Turkey — two-thirds of the global total — the report said.

The organization also expressed concern about India, the world's largest democracy, where it said that attacks on journalists are being motivated by violent populism.

Countries with the highest numbers of media killings:

Mexico: 13

Afghanistan: 11

Iraq: 11

Syria: 10

India: 6

Philippines: 4

Pakistan: 4

Nigeria: 3

Somalia: 3

"There is so much focus on Muslim women in hijab, and oppression and being docile," she said. "This is flipping this entire bigoted narrative on its head."

The hijab-wearing Barbie is part of the "Shero" line of dolls from Mattel that is based on inspirational women who are breaking social barriers, including Misty Copeland , who was the first African-American female principal dancer with the American Ballet Theater, and the plus-size fashion model Ashley Graham.

Introducing the toy at the Glamour event highlighted Ms. Muhammad's status as an accomplished athlete and the role that Barbies have played in the formative years of American girls.

There was a range of reactions to the new doll online, and Ms. Muhammad said she had braced for a backlash.

"As a public figure who is Muslim I am very accustomed to trolling — that is a part of my life," she said. "But it is still very shocking to me to read the very negative comments about dolls. We are still in a moment where we are unearthing this bigoted America that we all hoped and prayed did not exist."

Ibrahim Hooper, the spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said that after the doll was announced, he heard a radio broadcast about it that included derogatory and sarcastic language, including whether the doll would be "strapped with bombs."

"The haters are out in force against this," he said. "Hijab is like a red flag to the Islamophobes."

He pointed to numerous occasions when Muslim women have been singled out by their head coverings and verbally or physically attacked.

"The fact that the cottage industry of Islam bashers has crawled out from under their rocks to attack this relatively benign manifestation of Islam in America is an indicator of where we are at," Mr. Hooper said.

Michelle Chidoni, a Mattel spokeswoman, said on Tuesday that the doll was inspired by the company's push to include a more diverse array of skin color, professions and body types in the Barbie line.

"Barbie the icon has created a lot of conversation around women and women's roles in the world, and she has really swung with the times," Ms. Chidoni said. "She is a lightning rod for conversation."

An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a Mattel spokeswoman. She is Michelle Chidoni, not Didoni. Correction: November 16, 2017

An earlier version of this article misstated when the new Barbie was revealed. It was first put on display on Monday afternoon at the summit portion of Glamour's annual event, not on Monday night during the awards show.As a millennial, I've been held responsible for the demise of many a fine thing. Diamond engagement rings yoghurt , and even lunch —you name it, we've probably ruthlessly destroyed it somehow. But, if there's one thing I'm really not sad about destroying, it's the doorbell. I consider this (hopefully) soon-to-be obsolete device highly intrusive, but also hugely panic-inducing. And, it seems I'm far from alone in this.

Smartphone-obsessed millennials and Gen Zers are reportedly "so used to texting upon arrival that the sound of a ringing doorbell freaks them out; 'it's terrifying.'" For me, these words couldn't ring more true. Whenever I'm headed to a friend's house, the thought of putting my finger on the doorbell doesn't even cross my mind. I send a text, WhatsApp or even a Snap to let them know I'm outside. To some, this might sound odd or even slightly awkward.

Someone just buzzed our flat and I'm doing that apparently millennial thing of not answering the door. — Bethan (@BethanWilliams) August 11, 2017

But, there are a few reasons for this behaviour. Firstly, I worry that by pressing the doorbell, I might be pinging the wrong property, alerting a complete stranger to my presence, resulting in a hideously awkward interaction that could have been avoided. Secondly, who's to even say that this doorbell even works? I could be just standing here like an idiot forever waiting on a friend who has no idea that I'm here. And, thirdly, when my phone's already in my hand, and I'd rather avoid the former two scenarios, isn't it just easier to text my friend? It's certainly less panic-inducing.

When it comes to the doorbell at my own flat, I'd really rather it didn't exist at all. That's because I find it completely invasive. My friends and family text or call me when they're at the door. So, when the doorbell sounds unannounced, I panic.

Take this past weekend, for instance. I was excited to have the flat to myself for a few days. But, one thing interfered with that peace and quiet—the doorbell. The first time it happened, I was standing in my PJs making coffee in my kitchen when the jarring sound of our doorbell invaded my home. I froze. I wasn't expecting anyone, and I certainly wasn't fit to be seen. The panic welled inside me as I cleaved my phone in my hand expecting a text to arrive, reassuring me that someone I knew was at the door. But nothing came. After two more rings, I knew I was probably going to have to deal with this unwanted intrusion. This happened on two more occasions that weekend, and by the end of it, I wanted to run and hide.

Thankfully, I'm not alone in my hatred of the doorbell. 19-year-old Ellen McArthur from Devon says she just texts her friends when she's arrived at their place. "Doorbells are dead," she says. And 21-year-old Olly Browning from London says he "insists" on his friends WhatsApping him when they've arrived. "I loathe how interruptive doorbells are," he explains. His doorbell sounds "so loud and shrill" it's "hateful". He concedes that there is something "necessary" about having a doorbell, but he avoids going to the door if he's not expecting something or someone. When Browning shows up at his mates house, he WhatsApps them. "I just think it's friendlier. Also, if it's a new house you don't want the embarrassment of knocking on the wrong door OR interrupting a friend whilst they're cleaning/weeing/getting ready."

23-year-old Jen Lou Meredith from Suffolk says she only uses doorbells as a last resort if she her friends don't answer their phones when she's standing outside. She says she prefers not to answer the doorbell because she's afraid something bad might happen. "When I was younger my parents told me not to answer the door in case it's a stranger and they try to kidnap me (dramatic, I know). Since then, I've always had a sense that something bad is going to happen when the doorbell rings. So I just prefer not to answer it," she says.

Meredith doesn't think there's much point to doorbells for her generation. And, I'm inclined to agree with her. In 2017—in the age of Snap Maps, iMessaging and dropped pins—having a doorbell just seems unnecessary. When a push notification or text can alert you to the arrival of your Deliveroo order, or Amazon parcel, many of us could probably get by without ever hearing our doorbell ring. To many of us, a doorbell ringing represents an unwelcome intrusion, or even "stranger danger". If a text or call doesn't accompany that ring, then that door won't be opened anytime soon.Move comes two years after hundreds of women were groped and molested by gangs of men on New Year's Eve in Cologne

Organisers of Germany's biggest New Year's Eve party at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate are setting up a special "safety zone" for women who have been assaulted or feel threatened.



The move comes two years after hundreds of women were groped, sexually molested and robbed by gangs of men during New Year's Eve festivities in Cologne

Hundreds of thousands of revellers are expected to flock to Berlin's "party mile" on Sunday in front of the Brandenburg Gate in the heart of the city.

The annual open air event with fireworks, live bands and DJs, continues into the early hours of the morning.

Berlin police confirmed that this year women would be able to seek help in an area staffed by the German Red Cross.

"The organisers have set up a safety zone for women who have been victims of a sexual offence or are feeling harassed," a police statement said.

Anja Marx, a spokeswoman for the event, said there would be a tented area with psychologists on hand.

"We are doing this for the first time," she said by phone. "The police requested it after they did it at the Munich Oktoberfest this year and it worked out well."

She said there had not been problems at previous New Year celebrations in Berlin.

A police report described how women were surrounded by gangs of men who sexually assaulted them, often while stealing their wallets and phones.

The violence fuelled criticism of chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to open Germany's doors to more than a million migrants after it emerged that many of the assaults were carried out by men of North African and Arab appearance.

Nearly a year into his takeover of Washington, President Trump has made a significant down payment on his campaign pledge to shrink the federal bureaucracy, a shift long sought by conservatives that could eventually bring the workforce down to levels not seen in decades.

By the end of September, all Cabinet departments except Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs and Interior had fewer permanent staff than when Trump took office in January — with most shedding many hundreds of employees, according to an analysis of federal personnel data by The Washington Post.

The diminishing federal footprint comes after Trump promised in last year's campaign to "cut so much your head will spin," and it reverses a boost in hiring under President Barack Obama. The falloff has been driven by an exodus of civil servants, a diminished corps of political appointees and an effective hiring freeze.

Even though Congress did not pass a new budget in his first year, the drastic spending cuts Trump laid out in the spring — which would slash more than 30 percent of funding at some agencies — also has triggered a spending slowdown, according to officials at multiple departments.

The White House is now warning agencies to brace for even deeper cuts in the 2019 budget it will announce early next year, part of an effort to lower the federal deficit to pay for the new tax law, according to officials briefed on the budgets for their agencies. One possible casualty: a pay raise that federal employees historically have received when the economy is humming.

The administration's effort so far to reshape the workforce of nearly 2 million civil servants that serves as the backbone of the government already has provoked a contentious culture shift.

Federal workers fret that their jobs could be zeroed out amid buyouts and early retirement offers that already have prompted hundreds of their colleagues to leave, according to interviews with three dozen employees across the government. Many chafed as supervisors laid down new rules they said are aimed at holding poor performers and problem workers to account.

A hiring freeze technically lifted in the spring has been kept in practice at most agencies, hollowing out many offices. And the slow pace of political appointments has left a number of departments with a leadership vacuum in their upper ranks.

"Morale has never been lower," said Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 federal workers at more than 30 agencies. "Government is making itself a lot less attractive as an employer."

Administration officials said that Trump has actually improved employee morale, citing an Administration officials said that Trump has actually improved employee morale, citing an annual survey of federal workers taken in the spring that showed a slight uptick across most agencies. They said they are streamlining the government to make it leaner and more effective.

In a statement, White House spokesman Raj Shah said Trump "is committed to streamlining government for the 21st century, reducing bloat, duplication and waste, and focusing resources on key priorities like public safety and protecting our nation's homeland."

Conservatives who have long pushed for smaller government are cheered by the developments.

"This is going very well," said anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, who famously once quipped that he wanted to shrink government small enough so he could "drown it in the bathtub."

"Slow and steady — for all the bluster, this is how you downsize government without engendering blowback," Norquist added.

And some civil servants said they welcome the focus on rooting out waste and holding federal workers to high standards.

"Oftentimes we run on autopilot and continue to fund programs that don't produce the results that were intended," said Stephanie Valentine, a program analyst at the Education Department. "You can't keep blindly spending because that's what we've always done."

Trump already has begun to reverse the growth of the Obama era, when the government added a total of 188,000 permanent employees, according to Office of Personnel Management data.

By the end of September, the federal government had 1.94 million permanent workers, down nearly 16,000 overall since the beginning of the year, according to the most recent OPM data. In the first nine months of 2009, Obama's first year in office, the government added 68,000 permanent employees, growing to 1.84 million.

The last time federal employment dropped during a president's first year, President Bill Clinton was in the White House.

The relatively small net decrease under Trump so far masks what has been a substantial drop-off in staffing at certain agencies.

One of the biggest reductions has been at the Bureau of Prisons, which lost 2,320 permanent workers at a time when the Justice Department plans to One of the biggest reductions has been at the Bureau of Prisons, which lost 2,320 permanent workers at a time when the Justice Department plans to return to using private prisons to house some federal inmates. (A spokesman said the staffing decline was largely due to attrition and hiring delays.) The Census Bureau, which has not received its full budget request from Congress for multiple years , fell by more than 1,000 employees. The Environmental Protection Agency, where Administrator Scott Pruitt has moved quickly to reverse a generation of environmental protections and rules, was down 508 employees.

The shrinking federal workforce could end up undercutting some of Trump's priorities. Employment within the Defense Department, which Trump has promised to beef up, dropped by 1 percent, or 7,811 civilian workers across all branches of the military.

And the Internal Revenue Service, which is charged with the complex task of implementing Trump's tax overhaul plan, lost 6,801 permanent staffers in the first nine months of this year, a drop of nearly 9 percent, personnel data shows.

To the exits

There are signs that Trump's polarizing presidency has helped drive more civil servants to the exits this year — voluntary departures that have contributed to the shrinking workforce.

During the first six months of the administration, 71,285 career employees quit or retired. That's up from 50,000 who left during the same period in 2009, according to the most recent OPM data.

Among them is Noah Kunin, the former infrastructure director for 18F, the high-profile office created in the General Services Administration in 2014 to boost the government's digital services.

Kunin said he lost staff who did not want to work for the new administration — and then was unable to replace them because of the early hiring freeze. He said he grew frustrated with what he called a slow start by the White House on bringing private-sector solutions to the government.

"I was involved in several major initiatives, and they were all stalled," he recalled.

When he heard former FBI director James B. Comey tell Congress in June that Trump had asked him for his personal loyalty, Kunin said his red line was crossed.

Now working in Minneapolis as a software consultant, Kunin says the decision was "the most personal choice I've ever made: to stay engaged or leave."

In some agencies, the number of people leaving has been crippling, according to former officials. At the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a wave of recent retirements has depleted the managerial staff at the enforcement agency's 70 field offices, said Jordan Barab, who was a top OSHA official in the Obama administration. In all, the agency shed 119 permanent workers by the end of September, a 6 percent drop, personnel data shows.

"It's starting to create major problems," Barab said. Enforcement actions must be reviewed by supervisors in multiple offices, he said, and if too many months pass, they can be thrown out. "You can't run an enforcement agency with no managers."

A spokesman for the Labor Department declined to comment on the current number of OSHA managers but said that new inspectors have been hired in recent months, helping increase the number of safety and health inspections in 2017 — the first such boost in five years.

Across the government, roughly a third of workers who were hired in 2015 will be eligible to retire by 2020, Across the government, roughly a third of workers who were hired in 2015 will be eligible to retire by 2020, according to the Government Accountability Office. But one of the best pipelines for getting young talent into the government has languished this year.

The Presidential Management Fellows program, a prestigious internship for top graduate students, has been unable to place many recruits because of a lingering hiring freeze at many agencies, according to a half-dozen current fellows.

Meanwhile, other federal workers are in limbo because their jobs could cease to exist. That's the precarious state right now of the tiny Chemical Safety Board, one of 19 small agencies Trump has marked for elimination.

The $11 million office investigates the causes of major chemical accidents and makes recommendations for safety improvements. In early December, a White House budget official told Chairperson Vanessa Allen Sutherland that because the deficit has grown, the safety board must do its part and prepare to shut down, she said.

So far, no members of Congress have called for the board to be eliminated. But Sutherland is still busy bolstering the spirits of her 43 employees while formulating a shutdown plan. "I think I'll definitely be there to turn out the light switches and take the Styrofoam cups with me," she said.

Slow to appoint

Trump has also moved slowly in appointing the most important personnel in his government: the political leaders who are supposed to be the architects of his vision.

View Graphic  Tracking how many key positions Trump has filled so far

Of 624 key Of 624 key political positions requiring Senate confirmation, just 240 were confirmed as of Friday, according to data tracked by The Washington Post and the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service.

A slow recruitment and vetting process, combined with drawn-out Senate confirmation schedules, stalled the process. As of last week, 79 nominees across the government had waited more than 100 days for a Senate hearing.

But the president has also expressed skepticism that such appointees are valuable.

"I tell my people, 'Where you don't need to fill slots, don't fill them,' " Trump told conservative radio host Laura Ingraham in November.

In the meantime, many agencies have relied heavily on career employees in acting leadership roles. But their leadership can be tentative.

"Some careerists feel paralyzed," said Reginald Wells, who recently retired from the Social Security Administration as human resources chief. "They don't want to make a mistake."

At the Labor Department, most top political posts still lack Trump appointees. For months, Secretary Alexander Acosta's chief of staff doubled up jobs, serving as the department's chief lawyer in an acting capacity until the Senate confirmed Trump's nominee late this month.

The clock ran out for hundreds of acting officials in November when a little-known law called the Vacancies Act — designed to spur presidents to staff their government — kicked in, limiting them from making official decisions.

The law allows acting officials to serve for up to 300 days, at which point they must yield their authority to the agency head, unless the president has nominated someone to the job. An official action taken in violation of the law could face a legal challenge.

That forced a complicated workaround at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, where Deputy Director Thomas Homan has been serving as acting director while he awaits confirmation.

For now, to continue to act as ICE chief, he has been signing his name with this title: deputy director and senior official performing the duties of the director.

Other agencies have been virtually paralyzed without political appointees.

The small Merit Systems Protection Board, which considers appeals from federal employees who believe they were unfairly fired or demoted, has not heard a case in 11 months.

One of Obama's appointees to the three-member board left in January, leaving two vacancies. Trump has yet to nominate anyone to the panel. With no quorum, the lone board member, Republican Mark Robbins, cannot take action on a backlog of more than 700 cases dating to early 2015.

His father jokes that he is a highly paid bureaucrat with nothing to do. But Robbins said he keeps busy reading cases and writing his opinion of each one. Then he carries each file across the hall to two empty offices piled high with legal accordion files, where they await review by future board members.

Robbins insisted that the administration "hasn't been ignoring us," adding that he hopes for a quorum by spring.

Even key White House posts have gone unfilled.

The president still has no science adviser. And the Office of Management and Budget is waiting for the Senate to confirm its nominees for deputy director and controller — vital positions tasked with restructuring the government.

Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), an advocate for modernizing federal technology systems, said that eight of 24 agencies are without chief information officers.

"We're losing momentum in the fight against cyberattacks," he said.

Federal contractors, including defense giant General Dynamics, have complained in earnings calls that leadership vacancies have slowed contract awards and delayed getting money authorized and appropriated.

"It's very important to have senior leaders in place to make those long-term commitments," said Alan Chvotkin, executive vice president of the Professional Services Council, a trade group that represents federal contractors.

Culture shift

For those inside the bureaucracy, a new Trump-era focus on accountability has meant working under greater oversight — and in some cases, fear of reprisals.

Agencies have told employees that they should no longer count on getting glowing reviews in their performance appraisals, according to staff in multiple offices, as has been the case for years.

Housing and Urban Development managers, for example, are being evaluated for the first time on how effectively they address poor performers, according to Ashaki Robinson Johns, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 476, which represents HUD employees.

Telework — a popular Obama-era policy that expanded work from home — has come under scrutiny as Trump officials have questioned whether it is a license to goof off. The Agriculture and Commerce departments are now moving to restrict the flexible work policy, in some offices by half the amount of time previously permitted, according to documents and employees.

A spokesman for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that while he recognizes that telework is widely used in the public and private sectors, he has asked agency heads "to make sure that they have systems in place to assure that management's objectives are met."

There are also tensions over forced reassignments for employees whom Trump officials view as out of sync with their agency's priorities.

Matthew Allen, a former Pentagon spokesman and onetime communications chief for the Bureau of Land Management, said he found himself quickly marginalized after he suggested that the bureau should share more public information about its activities.

In late September, he was abruptly transferred to another office and demoted — among dozens of senior executives whom Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke reassigned in the fall. The Interior Department's inspector general is In late September, he was abruptly transferred to another office and demoted — among dozens of senior executives whom Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke reassigned in the fall. The Interior Department's inspector general is investigating the reassignments.

Allen said he witnessed a "level of paranoia about whistleblowing and information that I've never encountered in all my years of federal service." A spokeswoman for the Interior Department declined to comment, noting that Allen has a pending lawsuit against the agency.

The administration has made its biggest push for employee accountability at Veterans Affairs, which was found in 2014 to have covered up excessive wait times for patients. In June, the president signed a law allowing the agency to fire or demote poor performers or employees accused of misconduct with 15 days' notice.

In a Veterans Day speech at Arlington National Cemetery, Vice President Pence drew applause from the crowd when he said that VA had fired or suspended more than 1,500 employees for negligent behavior.

In a letter to the White House, House Republicans recently asked if other agencies should have the same firing powers.

"The mood is different," said Debra D'Agostino, founding partner of the Federal Practice Group, a law firm representing federal employees. In October alone, the firm took on 30 new clients facing proposed removals — up from the usual one or two a month, she said.

"There's a feeling out there that they're not going to get as much pushback for trying to fire someone," she said.

Some civil servants have sought to stay as a bulwark against changes at their agency.

At Veterans Affairs, John Fuller wrestled with leaving for months. A retired Army major, he's a lifelong Republican who voted for Trump. He has played a pioneering role in the federal government as VA's chief race relations and culture educator, traveling the country to meet with employees in small groups to heal racial divisions.

"I have so much passion for the job left," the 65-year-old said in early December. But Fuller said he was told his travel budget would be shifted to other priorities.

Days before Christmas. Fuller put in his retirement papers. In a letter to VA, he blamed officials for pulling support from what he called "a genuine race relations dialogue" that drew acclaim across the government.

MSU linebackers Joe Bachie and Chris Frey, Jr., took to Twitter on Saturday to voice their support for the Big Ten, while also getting in one last dig at Michigan.

The league is 7-0 in bowl games this year, with Michigan the last team left to play, Monday against South Carolina in the Outback Bowl (noon, ESPN2).

"Good luck to the rest of the B1G and South Carolina," Chris Frey, Jr. wrote Saturday afternoon, before Penn State beat Washington, 35-28, in the Fiesta Bowl.

Good luck to the rest of the B1G and South Carolina! — Chris Frey Jr (@Cfrey_23) December 30, 2017

Then, later in the night, Wisconsin knocked off Miami, 34-24, in the Orange Bowl.

"Big ten baby!," Bachie wrote. "But still #CmonSouth Carolina"

Big ten baby! But still #CmonSouthCarolina — Joe Bachie (@JoeBach35) December 31, 2017

Through Sunday, the Big Ten remained the lone conference with an unbeaten bowl record. The Big 12 (5-2) and Sun Belt (4-1) are the only other leagues with records above .500.

Meanwhile, the PAC 12 dropped to 1-8. The SEC is 1-3, with five teams still left to play, including two (No. 3 Georgia, No. 4 Alabama) in the College Football Playoff.

The dings, while not surprising, come after a contentious bowl selection season between Michigan and Michigan State. The Spartans, who beat Michigan and finished the 2017 regular season with a 9-3 record, were passed over for the 8-4 Wolverines by the Outback Bowl selection committee.

That set off a back and forth between MSU coach Mark Dantonio and Jim Harbaugh, with Harbaugh telling a Florida TV station that he'd "just prefer that (Dantonio) didn't talk about us."

Dantonio responded shortly thereafter, writing on Twitter: "For all Spartans, 'it's not all over, it'll never be over, it's just getting started' #SpartansWill"

Michigan State beat Washington State, 42-17, on Thursday in the Holiday Bowl.Donate to arXiv

Obviously, I'd prefer criminals didn't have guns, but there are people who are so diametrically opposed to all that I hold dear who I'd rather see disarmed, as a general rule.

However, I also recognize that in order for me to maintain my rights, I have to protect the rights of people I don't particularly care for.

You know, kind of like these guys.

According to Redneck Revolt's mission statement, organising people also requires organising a defence of their communities. Hence, the gun range. The Suffolk County branch group meets up for weekly sessions at the range, the name of which they asked to be kept secret. They often bring along other leftists groups, like the PSL, the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), or the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Mike says those are some of his favourite days on the range. "I think it's very cool that we can bring groups together that normally wouldn't have anything else in common," he told me. "And seeing a whole bunch of leftists with guns is cool." Not everyone thinks the guns are cool, of course. Redneck Revolt has gotten pushback from liberal groups who think the weapons sully their image. But the members maintain that the firearms are necessary to protect themselves, and the communities of colour they want to help serve.

Much as I may disagree with these guys on just about everything they stand for, the beauty of the Second Amendment is that it protects their right to keep and bear arms as well.

What's more, they seem to grasp that guns are essential to personal protection, hence their decision to have them regardless of what their fellow leftists think.

And, honestly, if that's where it stays, more power to them.

The question is, will it?

"We are willing to take on personal risk to defend those in our community who live under the risk of reactionary violence because of their skin colour, gender identity, sexuality, religion, or birth country," the group's mission statement reads. "For us, that means that we meet our neighbours face-to-face, and stand alongside them to face threats whenever possible."

The problem here is that it sounds like they're looking for a fight. More to the point, I can't help but look at their statement and see them looking for a fight against law enforcement who are constantly charged with violence against minorities, gays and lesbians, and transgendered people among other things. The rhetoric matches up all too well for me to not think such a thing.

However, the beauty of the Second Amendment is that so long as they don't start anything, they're more than welcome to own guns and shoot them. In fact, I'll defend their right to own firearms to my last breath, despite the fact that I'd rather they didn't.

The reason is that the Second Amendment isn't just for one group of people. It's for all Americans. It's uniquely American, existing nowhere else on this Earth.

While I have little doubt that if Redneck Revolt got their Utopia, we'd all be disarmed in short order, they don't have it and the fact that they have the right to be armed proves just how little tyranny they're really experiencing.

After all, the Second Amendment is for everyone.Ask the community

I probably accidentally learned it from him

aaaaugh so unoriginalالببغاء الامازوني اصفر القفا Yellow-naped amazon Parrot

الببغاء الامازوني اصفر القفا هو احد الببغاوات المتكلمة الجميلة جدا و التي تتميز بدكائها المبهر اضافة لكونها رفيقة ممتعة عند الترويض ينتمي هذا النوع الى سلالة ببغاوات الامازون التي تتميز بلونها الاخضر و بتنوع اشكالها .

موطنه و مكان العيش :

يتواجد الببغاء الامازوني اصفر القفى من على طول ساحل المحيط الهادئ من جنوب المكسيك إلى شمال كوستاريكا بما في دلك هندوراس ، و غواتيمالا و السلفادور ، يفضل هذا الببغاء العيش في الغابات الاستوائية و في الغابات المحيطة بالامستنقعات الساحلية اضافة الى اشجار المنغروف و الاراضي ضمن المناخ الشبه الجاف بما في دلك الصنوبر لكن هناك تراجع كبير لموائلها الطبيعية بشكل مستمر بسبب التدخل البشري .

الغداء :

يتغدى الببغاء الامازوني اساسا على الفواكه و البدور متل التين و الإهليلج ، الصنوبر ، بكسية ، ديلنية ... الى انه بامكانك تقديم كل من الخضروات و الفواكه و المكسرات و البدور كما انه يوجد اغدية خاصة بها في محلات بيع الطيور .

الفرق بين الدكر و الانتى :

هناك تطابق كبير بين الجنسين في ما يتعلق بالشكل الخارجي مما يزيد صعوبة تحديد جنس الطيور لكن يبقى افضل حل هو اجراء فحص DNA للتاكد بشكل كامل .

موسم التكاثر :

هناك عدد قليل من المعلومات حول وقت التكاثر في الطبيعة الى انه يحدت عموما في الفترة بين فبراير و مايو حين يكون الطقس حار حيث تبني هاته الطيور اعشسها في الاشجار و تضع الانتى ما بين 3 و 4 بيضات دات لون ابيض سادة تستمر فترة حضنهم قرابة ال 28 يوم لتخرج الصغار من العش بعد مرور 11 اسبوعا على فقصها و تنضج في عمر الخمس سنوات .

التربية :

متل العديد من انواع الببغاوات تتم تربية الببغاء الامازوني في اقفاص كبيرة حيث يتم تقديم الفواكه و المكسرات اضافة الى ما دكر سابقا كاللوز و بدور الصنوبر و الفول السوداني اضافة الى ذرة الحبش المطبوخة ، الأناناس التين الرمان الجزر السبانخ ... لكنها للاسف معروفة بمزاجها المضطرب قليلا حيث انها قد تقوم بالعض بدون سابق اندار كما انها قد تكون في بعض الاحيان شرسة تجاه نفس جنسها لكن عند ترويضها يقل هذا الامر بشكل كبير و خصوصا اذا اقتنيتها غير مروضة و الاسلوب المتبع في الترويض هو شبيه الى حد كبير بالببغاء الافريقي الرمادي نظرا لتقارب احجامهما .

اما بالنسبة لمن يرغب في الانتاج فمن الافضل ان تقوم باقتناء طيور بعمر لا يتجاوز ال 10 سنوات و من المهم كدلك توفير سلاكة كبيرة مع بعض الشجيرات و الاعشاش المستخدمة في انتاجه هي شبية بشكل كبير باعشاش الكوكاتو إذ يجب ان تكون كبيرة و من الخشب الصلب و السميك لكونه يحب قضم الخشب بشكل كبير .

معلومات عامة :

إزالة الغابات يقلل من عدد هذه الببغاوات في البرية جنبا إلى جنب مع الصيد الغير الشرعي لصالح تجارة الحيوانات الاليفة .

قد يعيش هذا الببغاء ليبلغ ما يصل إلى 90 عاما .

The new U.S. tax code amends IRC Section 1031 (a)(1) regarding "like kind exchanges," excluding all cryptocurrencies from a previous legal loophole and making all cryptocurrency trades a taxable event.

On Friday morning, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a new tax bill into law, signalling the first major tax overhaul in the U.S. in over 30 years. And while you may or may not have high praise for the bill, one thing is certain: the new tax code is bad news for cryptocurrency investors. Starting Jan. 1st, 2018, all cryptocurrency trades will be a taxable event, including swapping one cryptocurrency for another.

Closing the 1031 Loophole

The recent overhaul amends a part of the tax code regarding exemptions for "like kind exchanges," allowing investors to swap similar assets without triggering a tax event. These so-called "1031 exchanges" have long been used by traders to exchange property, such as art or real estate, without having to pay taxes on it.

Since March 2014, the IRS has treated Bitcoin and other digital currencies as property for tax purposes. This makes them subject to capital gains tax, requiring taxes be paid whenever crypto is exchanged for fiat currency (ie. cash).

Coins held for less than a year are subject to regular income tax, which can range anywhere from 10 to 37 percent, depending upon personal income levels. Coins held for longer than one year are subject to long-term capital gains tax, which caps at around 24 percent.

However, it has never been clear whether a trade between two different cryptocurrencies qualifies as a "like kind exchange." Up until this point, cryptocurrency trades have typically resided in this legal gray area, granting most traders a loophole for deferring taxes on short-term capital gains.

However, the new amendment definitively narrows the 1031 exemption to only cover real estate swaps, excluding Bitcoin entirely. It specifically limits the scope of the law from previously covering "property" to now only covering "real property." And as a digital asset, cryptocurrency is about as far from "real property" as one can get.

The end result is that, starting next year, effectively all cryptocurrency trades will be taxed at the time of their execution, bringing an end to one of the most lucrative tax loopholes previously available to traders.

Death, Taxes, and Cryptocurrency

This change marks a significant blow for U.S. cryptocurrency investors. Although trades between fiat currency and crypto have previously been taxed, the vast majority of trading which occurs between separate cryptocurrencies has flown under the radar.

Although traders are expected to pay taxes once they "cash out" or trade their coins for goods and services, swapping between cryptocurrencies has allowed investors to defer their tax obligation for short-term capital gains. Now investors will no longer be able to avoid income tax on these trades without holding onto a specific cryptocurrency for over a year.

What remains to be seen is whether users will actually heed the law, as many U.S. investors already have an notoriously bad habit of avoiding taxes on their Bitcoin profits. From 2013 to 2015, the IRS discovered that fewer than 1,000 people in the U.S. had paid taxes on their bitcoins each year, prompting a controversial lawsuit against Coinbase, demanding they hand over all user transactions from those years.

Tensions with the IRS will likely only get worse next year should Bitcoin investors continue to shirk their tax obligations. Gains of nearly $14,000 in Bitcoin this year alone will likely spell billions of dollars of missed tax revenue for the IRS should Americans choose to cheat the taxman again next spring.

Do you think that the new amendment is fair towards Bitcoin users? What is your stance on taxing cryptocurrencies? Let us know in the comments below.

I had no idea why at the time. It was a pure impulse purchase, driven by something I hadn't felt for a while in gaming – a sense of excitement. It took me a while to figure out why I was excited, hence this entry in my blog.

I have been soaking in its pages and have been impressed with most of what I have seen so far. A true space opera RPG with a fairly robust set of rules. Outstanding artwork and some ingenious thinking about how to handle the timeline between Pathfinder and Starfinder. I could critique some of the rules, I won't. Starfinder is far too important in the industry right now. I accept it for what it is. A return to pure open-ended sci-fi gaming. A return to the era of the space opera.

Oh, sure we've had sci fi gaming all long (Shadowrun, Eclipse Phase, etc.) but we what the industry has lacked for years is a good generic sci fi RPG in the tradition of old school gaming.

I am a graduate of that old school, white box D&D and black box Traveller and all. Pathfinder harkens back to those days and that was why I was excited about it.

Looking back, Traveller broke new ground when it came out in a lot of respects. One, your character could die during creation – and two, it was a rules set for a big damn universe of mystery and combat. Gamemasters had a clean slate in the early years to craft our own universes.

There were other games that came along – Metamorphosis Alpha and Gamma World, for example – but they were targeted sub genres of the sci fi. They had limits. Of course, we had Space Opera and Iron Crown's Spacemaster, which were great at the time, though Spacemaster was hard to run as I recall, but there was a lot of stuff packed into the rules. FTL 2448 and even Fringeworthy opened up new uncharted gaming universes for us to craft into our own. Empires were to be forged and fortunes were out there waiting for us to take them.

WEG's Star Wars and FASA's original Star Trek RPG's were great, but those were established universes that had boundaries. We were limited by the IP (intellectual property.) Space opera role playing let the gamemaster define the universe, and often times there were few limits beyond the rules themselves.

Then TSR released Star Frontiers – and that provided us all with another big open-ended RPG in space. That was the peak of the space opera era. We still had Traveller out there, but by then, the Traveller universe was beginning to take form on its own, slowly boxing us in. The rise of the IP-driven sci fi RPG's pinched us even further. It was easier to pick up Star Wars then to create a universe from scratch.

Then came the dark times. Star Frontiers disappeared in 1986 or so, though game product continued on in the back rooms of local game stores. Traveller became Traveller 2300 which failed to capture our attention. Space Opera and Spacemaster went out of mainstream print as well. Those games like Eclipse Phase that emerged were defined.

Then this year, Starfinder came out. Paizo really took a big and successful gamble. Pathfinder has become, well, a library system on its own. There isn't a lot of room for growth. Jumpstarting a new space opera game seemed ridiculous on paper...except for us old school gamers. We knew that the market would support it. Hell, there had been a hole in that market that was waiting to be filled with a product of the quality and caliber of Starfinder.

I have read pudits whine about its compatibility with Pathfinder. I have heard the moans about starship combat (some of which I agree with.) Forget all of that. Starfinder has joined the pantheon of open-ended space RPG's and has earned already a place of distinction. Paizo seems to be supporting it heavily which will ensure its long-term success. Once more, we RPG gamemasters can take our players to the stars for big-ass adventures of our own creation. Starfinder is important because it fills a gap that has been out there for some time in the industry. The universe is a big place...filled with magic, tech, and sudden death. Saddle up!2017 marked Canada's 150th birthday, and the 9th year of HalifaxShippingNews.ca. For Canada's 150th Celebration The port saw 2 notable events – the RDV2017 tall ships regatta featuring vessels in Halifax, Dartmouth, and on parade and a visit by the USS Dwight D Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group

We also launched the Port Report updated every 4 hours, it offers the latest arrival, departure and weather information for the Port of Halifax, summarized in one location.

2017 saw a few notable Incidents. Murphy's on the water tour boat Harbour Queen 1 nearaly ended up on the rocks and needed a tow. awkwardly, later that week the TSB released a report into near miss between another tour boat and a cruise ship.

The former Montreal based self propelled bunker barge Arca 1 grounded off Sydney and the schooner Sorca was lost

Tropical shipping moved to Halifax from Saint John NB in January Though Halifax lost the Monthly Bahari stop to Saint John Later in the year, 2016 saw numerous Container line Acquisitions, which caused alliances to shuffle resulting in several new services running to Halifax including The Alliance's AL1 Service and AL 6 service. The final 3 ACL g4 vessels Atlantic Sea, Atlantic Sky and Atlantic Sun came into service. the last of the g3's, Atlantic Cartier retired in August.

Largest Ship to call in Canada put into Vancouver this year – Halifax also set its own record with the largest ship to date, and the first 10000+ TEU vessel.

The Port saw Numerous Upgrades, Including new pilot boats, Equipment upgrades at Halterm the retirement of 3 of the original cranes at Halterm, and the last original crane at Fairview Cove, and a new pier at the Naval dockyard to support the Arctic offshore Patrol Vessels.

At the Shipyard, the future HMCS Harry Dewolf was rolled out and assembled with a public open house and tours of the facility – the third mega block was rolled out later in December.

Davie Shipyards also finished and Delivered the NRU Asterisk, which arrived in Halifax in December and Tied up at Pier 20. 4 bids were also finally received for the CSC in late November, though one was bid outside the rules.

In Other Navy news, HMCS Athabaskan, the last of the tribals was decommissioned, and is to be scraped there is an effort to have her preserved as a museum ship, though that is probably unlikely with out corporate support. (ahem Davie)

The retired Halifax Ferry Dartmouth III Headed to Toronto, where she will be used to serve the Toronto Island. Given Lake Ontario is fresh water, she should have a long life if she proves useful.

2017 also brought the beginning of the end of sable offshore gas field, with the rig Noble Regina Allen arriving to begin Capping wells. BP is currently seeking approval to drill 7 test wells, though shell seeming came up dry after drilling 2 last year.

2018 Will bring this blogs 10th Birthday in August. January Should see the arrival of USS Little rock, currently broken in Montreal on her maiden voyage from the shipyard to her home port. probably bigger container ships, and even more TEU then last year.Background

During an attack on the IOTA network in October, some funds were found to be at risk of theft, due to users re-using their private keys. The IOTA team took the decision to protect IOTA token holders by taking those funds which were at risk into temporary custody through a snapshot.

Once the attack was stopped, the team worked on setting up a process for reclaiming the funds, and sending them back to the rightful owners. This process of receiving and validating the claims has been understandably complicated and sensitive — especially when taking into account the immutability of the IOTA distributed ledger. This effort has required the full attention of the entire core and legal teams of IOTA over the last few weeks. We are pleased to announce that we have finally come to the final step: sending out the reclaimed funds.

Sending back the Funds

As some community members have already noticed, we have already started sending out some of the claims (beginning with smaller ones) in batches. We will continue to do so over the course of the first week of January and aim to have all claims successfully processed by January 10th. Because this is a manual process, involving several validation and verification steps, we have limited the size of each batch to 30 claims.

Once all claims have been successfully processed, we will publish the list of claims with a full audit trail (an intrinsic component of the validation process), for the public to verify. We will also provide additional instructions for users that have not yet claimed their funds, on how they will be able to do so.

How do I know if my funds have been received?

The fastest solution, is it to simply check your address at one of the Tangle explorers (https://thetangle.org, https://iotasear.ch), or via the API (for those more technically-minded, with the getBalance API call). You can also log in to your GUI wallet and check if you have received a transaction, your balance should simply show up in your account.

Important: KYC for Multiple Claims

Several funds have been claimed multiple times (requested to be sent to different addresses). Considering that these could represent malicious attempts to steal funds from the rightful owners, the IOTA Foundation will be processing these claims only after having KYC'ed the claimants.

Because of this risk, the users of the following addresses should reach out to the IOTA Foundation at contact@iota.org, in order to get their claims processed. Simply send us an email, with the address(es) that are owned by you, and we'll then guide you through the process.

Closing Remarks

We understand that users were frustrated due to the prolonged process of regaining access to their funds, and we sincerely apologize for the delays. At IOTA, our priority is it to ensure that user funds are protected at all costs. We want IOTA to be a protocol that can be used with confidence, to transfer and store value. Because of this, we have taken this extraordinary step of taking user funds into custody during the attack.

We perceive that such steps may be necessary, especially during the growth stage of IOTA, and other crypto-currencies. All the best, and very much looking forward to an even better year 2018.Dear community

The end of the year calls for a short look back at 2017 and more importantly a look into what is coming up: 2018, the year we will be releasing our flagship product.

It's been a busy year for Metal and crypto-currencies in general. We launched our first product called the Metal Vault which offers our token holders a friendly way of storing their Metal tokens and other currencies in a safe place. We have also been working non-stop on Metal Pay which we'll tell you all about shortly in this blog post.

So what do we have in store for the new year? Let's get right to it.

Segregation of funds

At Metal we believe being transparent towards investors and customers is key to running any successful business. That's why we've separated our Metal token funds into separate accounts according to the whitepaper. This allows the general public to view our Metal token movements.

These are the current addresses:

PoPP Pool: 0x5237d79cbfcdbcb097f1b80bbe1dd1051d8a119a

Metal Operational Pool: 0x218c633956103ba25bf97fc20ec09d535752cca9

Metal HR Pool: 0x9db04Cf94Ad99757dD01d471B1DE815FC15e6eE2

Metal Foundation Pool: 0xf92909d2d198bd5acbae618de42f2bfcf0196286

Metal Pay release

The team is currently working hard on our flagship product, Metal "Pay". This app will allow our users to make payments with just a phone number while being rewarded to use the system.

Have a look at one of our demo videos:

Or check out this Siri integration:

Development of the app is coming together nicely and we are in the process of finishing the integration with our U.S. banking partner. We are currently on track to release this app in Q1 of 2018.

We are planning to release a first version of the app to a closed audience a few weeks prior to publicly launching the app. This will allow us to finetune the app and test drive the Proof of Processed Payments (PoPP) distribution algorithm while exposing it to a closed group of ethical hackers on our HackerOne bounty program.

Website

Many of you have contacted us, and we listened. The current website needs improvement, a lot of improvement. Which is why we've revamped our brand and website for the new year, more to come here...

The release of this new website is expected Q1 2018, shortly before the Metal Pay release.

Final words

Last but not least. We wish everyone safe and happy holidays and a prosperous new year. Everyone at Metal is looking forward to 2018, we can't wait to reveal what's behind the curtain.

Sincerely,

The Metal Team 🤘I have had one hell of a year. I have managed to end this year by throwing myself into the drama surrounding the Justice Democrats, but my year started with something entirely different.

I have mentioned, but not been clear about, my ongoing drama with my ex-wife and children. This time last year, on the final day of 2016 I was riding high on hope. I had just broken the silence between my ex and I by showing up uninvited to her home on christmas eve with two bags of christmas gifts for the kids. They were still awake and were so happy to see me that night. By this time last year my ex had reopened communications with me and we had arranged to allow me to see the kids again.

Today I am awaiting a meeting with CAFCASS (Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service) who will be meeting with me in the new year to discuss this situation. How did things go so wrong in 365 days? How did I go from being filled with hope that things could be worked out between my ex and I to being filled with determination to see this fight taken to court and settled once and for all?

I cannot talk about specifics, and I can't say anything that would endanger my case, but I can talk about my path this year. That path that I have traveled around the world is somewhere in the neighborhood of 15000 miles in length, by aircraft, car, train, and bus I have been across two continents.

When I look objectively at my year it looks like a very unfunny road trip adventure movie. Parts of it are supremely funny to me, but it is admittedly fairy black humor. So without further ado I would like to recount to you my 2017, in my own words, with as little sensoring to protect my case as possible. I hope you enjoy it, because for me it is a simple exercise to order my thoughts and justify my actions to myself.

January 2017 – This was a good month. I was reconnected with my children after months of separation. I had just stared a job at Barclays in Colchester. The staff and management of that bank are second to none. I made some true friends there. Everyone was mindful of my PTSD, and they cared about my wellbeing in general. Despite me being a crazy american who came out of nowhere, they accepted me into their lives and helped me as best they could. The management team were always there to support me and help me make sense of my personal life, and the act of working was doing wonders for my mental health.

February 2017 – This was a mixed month. On the side of it being an absolutely awesome month was the fact that my birthday and christmas gifts from my girl friend took effect this month. She took me to Hawksmoor Seven Dials restaurant. This was my first time I had ever had a Chateaubriand cut of meat, and oh did this change my life. I had gone my entire life thinking that the best beef was the domain of the United States. How wrong I was.

My girl also arranged a secret get away to Amsterdam. I sat by the canals, looked at the Van Gogh museum. This was also my first time tying to treat my PTSD with alternative methods, and again it was a life changing experience. It was as if my intrusive thoughts were behind a pane of frosted glass. The brains scattered on the concrete were less defined, the dead eyes of the slain were less clear, less disturbing. This enviroment was helping me more than any case of rum ever did. I was so impressed that when I got back to the UK I spoke to my doctor about the experience. I told her that I had done some research on the medical application of my experience in the new age shops and wondered if there was any programs in the UK which were testing this in people with PTSD. She told me there was not, so I tried to get into conventional counseling, and soldiered on.

On the other hand, I had training in London to do with my bank job. I had to take public transport my first time, and I had a major break down on the London Underground. I got out of the station, turned a corner and broke down in tears. I was a sobbing wreck, and luckily my partner was with me. She took care of me, kept on lookers away, and rolled me a cigarette to help focus my attention on something in the present to take me out of my memories.

Between my ex and I things were once again breaking down as well. Arguments started over how much child support I was paying and how often I saw the kids. I tried to make my ex understand that 500£ was all I could afford, and that saturday night into sunday was all I could do to take the children. I had only moved into the house that could accommodate them at the beginning of the month, and I had yet to fully furnish the house to support my five children.

March 2017 – This was a fairly normal month. There was a minor flare up regarding Easter. I had assume my ex, being a self professed christian, would want the children to be with her for resurrection sunday. I am not a christian, so I figured it would be the right thing to offer my ex my weekend with the children so she could share her faith with the kids on one of the most holy days of the year for christians. This caused a fight that I was unprepared for. It was assumed that this was some kind of plot to not spend time with my kids. I was shocked at this and reacted poorly. I brought up things that I was unhappy with, and I was not always calm and considered when I did so. Over all the drama was minimal, but when I look back the seeds of the coming catastrophe were planted in this month.

April 2017 – This was a stressful month. Email battles between my ex and I revolved around pick up and drop off times, but it quickly turned into accusations of abuse. I have no idea how it happened, and I can't go into detail, but it made it to social services who really just shook their heads and told us to get along. Frustration built up and my work started to suffer at the bank. I had no idea what was going to happen next.

May 2017 – This month the battle began in earnest. At the beginning of the month my legal council noticed that my UK visa was predicated on my relationship with my ex, and because we were separated and going into the divorce I needed to renew my visa to be based on being the father of british citizens, my children.

I needed a court order, or a letter from my ex wife stating that I had contact with my children. I hired an immigration lawyer, and got everything in place for an emergency appointment to sort this out before my trip home to the US. The thing was I had never met my my niece who was in and out of hospital, and I had not seen my biological sister in almost a decade. I felt like this might be my only chance to know my niece, as grim as that thought is. I felt like I absolutely had to return home, if only to meet blood kin for the first and last time. I am not saying this thought was rational, but it was my feeling at the time.

I was met with a list. My ex made me a list of demands in order to give me the letter I needed. I agreed to the first list, and she presented another, so I agreed to that, and I was given another list. The high lights of the last list of demands were things like agreeing to changing the kids names, tripling the amount of child support I paid to her, paying spousal support to her, and giving up my legal parental responsibility. Obviously I could not agree to this. I had one last day at the sea side with my kids, told them what was going on as best I could, and kissed them all good bye. This was the 23rd of May. and it was the last time I have seen or spoken to my children.

June 2017 – Start of the Adventure month. I returned to the US on the first. Having failed to secure the letter I needed to renew my visa I had no choice but to leave the country of my own free with so that I would not be legally barred from entry in the future. My partner came with me, and together we got an RV, and drove cross country. We planned to dig up crystals and I decided I would get a house in Washington state and take this matter to the courts. I managed to get a 160K offer of finance with my VA benefits and I started to dig. I spent time in Maryland with my sister and her family, and I was really happy. Despite everything that had happened I knew I was surrounded by people who loved me and who wanted the best for me.

July 2017 – The month of the bombshell. We decided to spend the 4th of July with my sisters family. We were ready to head back north to continue our digging and I got an email. Included were 5 Deed Poll documents. I could not believe what I was reading. My ex had changed all five of our childrens names, and even changed the first name of one of my children. I knew that a Deed Poll meant nothing with out an associated court order, but the fact that she thought that this was enough to change the kids names scared the hell out of me. Because of the way visas work, I had to spend 90 days outside of the UK before I returned, so I put my house purchase on hold, and threw myself into my mining. I spent 6 weeks sleeping in a tent at Ace of Diamonds mine. Digging all day, eating as cheaply as I could, and saving up for the flight back to the UK.

August 2017 – The month of return. I had spent most of the month in the mountains, but the end of the month I figured that given my situation I could argue my way in to the UK if I need to. I had to get to UK courts to put an end to this, and lucky for me the UK Border Force seemed to be ok with my reason. By the end of the month I was back in my old rented home in the UK, my landlord at Sudburys property management being compassionate people. Even now they have offered to extend my rental agreement on a month by month basis so I can deal with my legal issues. I touched down, slept off the jet lag and got to work.

September 2017 – The month of legal action. I went to work, I could not work for money, I was only on a tourist visa, but I had a box full of semi valuable quartz crystals and lots of time. I set aside 300 dollars and got some silver and started to work with the metal and stone. I educated myself on the law and decided that it was so overwhelmingly on my side in this matter that I felt I could represent myself in court on this issue.

October 2017 – The long month of waiting. I had put things into motion, now all I could do is wait. I have to admit the waiting took a toll on my mental health. I started to have panic attacks about whether or not I was doing the right thing. I started to doubt myself, starting to think maybe my children were better off without me in their lives. After all, I have a mental illness, I am a physically damaged combat vet, what could I offer young children other than a view of a broken man?

November 2017 – The month of court. I had my day in court, and what a day it was. I cannot speak about what happened but everything went my way. I had my partners mother at my side for support and I did everything I could, presented all of my proof and it was accepted. I went away with a path to contact with my children, I just had to wait for the court appointed bureaucracy to act. The month ended with a wonderful thanksgiving dinner cooked for me by my partner, and things were looking up.

December 2017 – The end of an exciting year. Another court date was arranged at a higher level. Again, I cannot speak to what happened, but I left thinking I would be speaking to the kids by christmas. This did not happen. Because my ex accused me of being a murder I now have to undergo investigations to assure the courts that I am not in fact a murderer. Sure, I hold myself to account for my part in the deaths of hundreds of people in Afghanistan, but hat was combat, not murder.

I had two major breakdown in my mental health over the disappointment in not speaking to my kids for christmas. This time of year is hard on everyone with a mental health issue, and for me it resulted in some really disturbing intrusive thoughts. I had visions of me committing suicide in some pretty horrifyingly realistic ways. This put so much pressure on my partner that I had convinced myself that the only way to make her happy was to be gone. Obviously I was wrong, and she brought me around, but she knew that I needed to be working. The metal work had stalled out when I ran out of stones to fit into ear ring studs, but I needed to be active in some way. I needed to keep my mind busy.

So it was with this in mind that I restarted this blog, I got involved with the #ReinstateCenk issue, I wrote an open letter which motivated 1500 people to sign a petition.

This time last year I could not have predicted the court case, the trip to the US and back to the UK, me digging beautiful quartz crystals out of the ground, or me making silver and diamond earrings. I would have called you crazy if you had told me I would be in a position to speak for a large group of people, to be the mouth by which they expressed frustration with the Justice Democrats.

I have so much to be thankful for, so much to be proud of overcoming. I have my work cut out for me in 2018, but all I can see ahead for me is victory.

Thank you so much for reading my words, you may not know me in person, but the fact that I can look at Reddit, I can look at my stats on this blog and see that I am reaching people all over the world. For now, that is more than enough to keep me on an even keel, and whether you meant it or not, you readers have given me a reason not to do something silly. Because I have people following what I have to say, I feel I have a responsibility to keep going. I cannot let my readers down by doing something stupid. I cannot fail my children who do need me in their lives, even if it is only by Skype and cards on special occasions. I can be the fairy tail adventuring father, and I have to trust that for them, I will be part of a coming of age adventure where they seek me out and experience a life of digging gems out of mountains.

Here's to 2018, which has no choice but to be better than 2017. Happy New Year everyone, and I hope I can continue to add my voice to the movement for peace and stability for all.

December will be remembered for the massive correction of Bitcoin prices after breaking the $ 20,000 mark, but many happened before the end of the year.

Rewind to January 2017. Bitcoin had just crossed the $ 1,000 barrier and the debate among crypto enthusiasts was that the virtual currency was set for a bullish year. It is fair to say that no one anticipated a growth of 2,000% before the market correction, but the statistics tell a different story.

The news organization originally rated Clinton's October 2016 claim as "True." "We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyber attacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election," Clinton said.

However, the Daily Caller News Foundation's fact-check team found this claim to be completely false. Clinton was referencing an intelligence report that only presented the views of three agencies, namely, the FBI, CIA and NSA.

"Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper himself appeared in front of Congress and explicitly pushed back on the idea that '17 intelligence agencies agreed,' stating flatly that it was just three," TheDCNF reported.

The New York Times and Associated Press have both issued corrections to stories that originally claimed the same false 17 intel agencies figure.

Politifact's editor's note to the October fact-check makes no mention of the corrected number, instead only referencing a general update.

"We've attached an update to this fact-check below in response to reader queries after subsequent testimony by James Clapper. The original fact-check and rating remain unchanged," the fact-check states.

There is no reference to the mistaken number in the editor's note, and the false claim from Hillary Clinton remained listed as "True."

Politifact issued a new fact-check Thursday regarding the 17 intel agencies claim with the title, "17 intelligence organizations or 4? Either way, Russia conclusion still valid."

In an attempt to justify their "True" rating for Clinton, Politifact cites Carrie Cordero, a counsel at ZwillGen law firm, saying, "In the context of a national debate, her [Clinton's] answer was a reasonable inference from the DNI statement."

Portrait mode was the most wanted feature for Nexus and Pixel 2016 users. I have considered that Portrait mode is a hardware limiting feature, it requires a special type of image data called PD (Pixel detector?) to enable Portrait mode, but some said Portrait mode can be active with front camera, I began to thinking that this feature should be able to work in software way which we can force to enable it on other phones. Turns out, Google uses PD data to calculate portrait effect on the Back lens while use software method on the Front lens.

We need the camera.experiment2017 library to active the Pixel 2 exclusive functions. thanks to the Apk changer, the first tool which can deodex the Android 8.1 odex files. I force to enable the PD data model in the camera.experiment2017 library, which is telling camera app to enable Portrait mode. Portrait mode will replace the Lens-blur mode in the menu, it provides the face-retouching feature on both front and back camera, and it needs a human face to do the portrait effect job, it will take two burst photos, one is normal ZSL HDR+ photos, the other is applied the portrait effect. if no human face shows up, you will get one normal photo.

Camera NX V7.3 is based on Google Camera 5.1.016, why not the latest 5.1.018 version? because they are the same app with different version numbers. I decide to disable the Google photos combination, as it has the black screen issue, though this issue can be solved by totally replace the original Google camera in the system, it needs the same signature and provider name. I also remove the Help and Feedback in settings, and disable the silence feedback service, to make the app launching a little faster.

The new version was tested on my Nexus 5X, should work on Nexus 6P and Pixel 2016 phones too. I will also provide the modified AR Sticker and AR Core app for Nexus 5X/6P, you can use it without change phone model or add files to the system, you can use other AR sticker mod if you like. I was thinking AR Core is still in beta status, bugs like upside down photo on Nexus 5X, too many things need to be fixed in the future, so no need to make it perfect at this moment.

Check the update version: Camera NX V7.4 base on Google Camera 5.2.

Update 01/02/2018 V7.3.1

Bug fix version

1. Fix abort HDR+ process FC problem.

2. Fix viewfinder flickering issue.

3. Add ZSL version for Android 7.1+, the previous one should be ZSL-enhanced version.

ZSL-enhanced version includes Motion photos, diet smart-burst and all ZSL version features, require Android 8.0+,

ZSL version contains ZSL HDR+, hybrid burst, 240 FPS slow-motion, 60FPS video ready, and other OG Pixel features. it is for Nexus 2015 running Android 7.1+, if you don't use motion photo, you can also use this one.

With 2018 less than 12 hours away, Star Wars: The Last Jedi has passed $1 billion at the global box office, joining an elite tier of movies from 2017 to do so, including Beauty and the Beast and The Fate of the Furious. Not exactly surprisingly, The Last Jedi has the dubious honor of being the only genuinely good movie to pass the mark this year. It's also now the highest grossing film of 2017 domestically, beating out serious competition from Wonder Woman, Beauty and the Beast, and Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 for the prize. None of this should come as a surprise to anyone who is masochistic enough to keep an eye on these numbers.

The Last Jedi also ended up on top for the third weekend in a row, making $52.4 million at the domestic box office. It just narrowly beat Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, which remained strong in second place with $50.5 million, pushing the reboot past the $150 million mark domestically. Below that, things remained the same since Friday's showings, with Pitch Perfect 3 bringing in $17.7 million in third and The Greatest Showman bringing in some $15.2 million in fourth. The only animated movie in the top five currently, Ferdinand, held at fifth with $11.6 million.

This will likely be Ferdinand's last week in the top five, what with Insidious: The Lost Key hitting multiplexes next weekend. There likely won't be a major shake-up in the top ten until Maze Runner: The Death Cure hits theaters in late January, and we likely won't see a real box office champ until Black Panther arrives in February. For now, Star Wars and Disney are once again on top of all at the box office, as it was in 2016 and likely as it will be in 2018. See you in the new year!

Here's your top five for the weekend:Colombia's ongoing peace process has failed to significantly reduce deadly violence in its first year, according to government statistics.

Defense Minister Luis Carlos Villegas said on Wednesday that 2016 was the most peaceful year in 40 years, claiming there had been a reduction of "around 320 homicides compared to the year before" when 11,500 people were murdered.

While Villegas highlighted the fact there has been progress in lowering homicides, the reduction was greater in the years prior to a ceasefire with the FARC.

Homicides in Colombia

Why is peace so violent?

One would think that disarming 12,000 FARC guerrillas and a ceasefire with the ELN guerrilla group would result in a major drop in violence.

This is, however, not what happened in Colombia in 2017.

According to the Medical Examiner's Office, reduced guerrilla violence seems to have been replaced by increased violence by paramilitary and drug trafficking groups.

During the de-escalation of conflict between the Government and the FARC after the bilateral ceasefire agreement in mid-2016 ... BaCrim and other emerging groups did not wait to take action. It is the task of the police to combat and control these groups, which generates fear among the population because of the revealed collusion [between the security forces and paramilitary groups] that has been revealed in a recent past.

Medical Examiner's Office

An embattled defense minister

Villegas, a former business representative, has come under increased criticism over the failures to reduce violence, particularly in the countryside.

Independent observers have said that the security forces' slow response to the guerrillas' demobilization allowed illegal armed groups to move in to former FARC territory.

The United Nations recently rejected the defense minister's claims that assassinated community leaders were involved in criminal activity.

The Medical Examiner's Office rejected Villegas' claims that political killings were isolated incidents and that paramilitary groups did not exist.

Notwithstanding, the minister seemed content with his own own tenure. According to Villegas, "we ended a very quiet year in regards to violent deaths."Tyler Barriss, the man who allegedly made the "swatting" call which led to an innocent man's death following a dispute over a Call of Duty wager match, has stated that he doesn't believe that he's responsible for the death. In an interview (via The Wichita Eagle), Barris admitted that he was involved, but said that there are many people who could be blamed.

"It's my personal belief that I didn't cause someone to die," Barriss said. "Of course I was involved. The call was made by me, but as far as the whole incident, you could point the finger at a few different people. You could point the finger at the cop that shot him, you could point the finger at the guy who made the call. You could point the finger at the person that gave the address."

Barriss has no apparent remorse or sense of responsibility. In fact, the night the news of the victim's death started circulating, it's reported that, through his Twitter handle (@SWAuTistic), Barriss said, "The kids house that I swatted is on the news." You can tell from his account name that this isn't his first swat call. Barriss has made similar calls in the past, which he was more than happy to boast about during his interview.

Barriss said that he usually just tries to evacuate buildings for fun -- to try to get on TV. "I know the police aren't going to catch me for doing that," he said. This time, though, Barriss was happy to get another human being involved. "I was minding my own business at the library and someone contacted me and said, 'Hey dude, this (expletive) just gave me an address and he thinks nothing is going to happen, do you want to prove him wrong?' And I said, 'Sure, I love swatting kids who think nothing is going to happen.'"

The report goes on to state that Barriss has been in trouble with the law multiple times for making bomb threats. Interestingly, it also states that despite being sentenced to prison multiple times, it's unclear how much of his sentence he ever served. Judging by his tone, it's apparent that Barriss believes himself to be quite beside (if not above) the law in his exploits. We'll find out very soon if that's true or not.While Obi-Wan Kenobi is one of the most revered characters in the popular Star Wars franchise, the actor who first brought him to life didn't think too much of the role.

A letter written by actor Alec Guinness to a friend details his experience on the set of George Lucas' first installment in space epic, and he doesn't sound too happy about it. The letter was recently posted to Reddit, offering some insight into the legendary actor's thoughts about Star Wars.

The letter reads:

My dear Anne,

I have returned to London this evening for my stint at the studio for the rest of the week. Can't say I'm enjoying the film — new rubbish dialogue reaches me every other day on wages of pink paper — and none of it makes my character clear or even bearable. I just think, thankfully, of the lovely bread, which will help me keep going until next April even if 'Yahoo' collapses in a week.

I must off to studio and work with a dwarf (very sweet, — and he has to wash in a bidet) and your fellow countrymen Mark Hamill and Tennyson (that can't be right) Ford — Ellison (? — No!*) — well, a rangy, languid young man who is probably intelligent and amusing. But Oh, God, God, they make me feel ninety — and treat me as if I was 106.

Love,

Alec

*Harrison Ford — ever heard of him?

Guinness sure seems like he was a pleasant fellow!

His complains about Lucas' dialogue are hardly new or unique. Both Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford have spoken at length about how hard it is to say these lines and have the execution come off naturally.

Both Ford and Hamill even ribbed Lucas himself this last summer at Star Wars Celebration's 40th anniversary panel.

But Guinness' complains about Ford are pretty interesting, considering the Han Solo actor went on to become one of Hollywood's icons. It's interesting to see this glimpse into how Guinness viewed the Star Wars film before it became a phenomenon, and goes to show that these instances are hardly new in the long-running franchise.Sound can make or break a video game's success. If you don't have a memorable melody in the soundtrack, you lose a hook to convince people to buy a sequel. If you don't have good sound design, you'll find it more difficult to immerse yourself in the world that's been created.

If you don't have sound at all... you're likely dealing with the initial release of an emulator.

After v0.1, I fixed some small bugs here and there, but I soon decided to attempt (what seemed like) a more complex task: finally adding sound to the emulator. And it works, somewhat. If you want to test it yourself, you can clone the v0.2 branch on GitHub and compile it using qmake.

But how does the DS sound processing unit (SPU) work?

The SPU has sixteen channels and two sound capture units. The channels can all play sound in PCM8, PCM16, and IMA-ADPCM; the first two are raw sound data, and the last one is compressed PCM16, similar to what you'd find in a .wav file. Channels 8-13 can also play PSG (square waves, like on the Game Boy), and channels 14-15 can play white noise. The SPU runs on its own clock at a frequency of ~16 MHz, which is just half the ARM7's clock rate. To load music into a channel, you input an address for memory and a frequency... and you're done. The channels are more configurable than that, of course, but it really is that simple. The capture units just take samples from channels 0-3 and put them in RAM, where the CPU can perform fancy sound effects before re-outputting them.

Implementing all of the above wasn't that bad. I had some difficulties getting ADPCM to work, but all of the issues were resolved in a matter of hours. The hardest part was making things compatible for the Qt frontend. On Windows and Linux, Qt sound automatically shuts itself off when it detects no sound data. Because the SPU would not output sound upon starting a game, well... there wouldn't be any sound. I resolved this by creating an intermediate buffer that stores old sound data, which is outputted if the SPU doesn't have anything. It doesn't sound great, but it gets the job done for now.

If you're familiar with the GBA, you'll see the DS SPU is a vast improvement over it. If not, let's do a comparison. The GBA has six channels, four of which are just copies of the Game Boy's sound registers. The other two take PCM8 data, but not automatically. If you want to use both channels, two of the four DMA (Direct Memory Access) units must be reserved for them. Furthermore, you must also reserve two of the four timer units, as the channels do not have their own clock. The GBA CPU is paused during the DMA transfers, so that means you have to make a tradeoff between CPU time and sound quality. The DS suffers from none of these flaws; all you need to do is supply the data, and the SPU works on its own.

The SPU implementation in CorgiDS is incomplete, for the moment. Neither the capture units nor the sound FIFOs are implemented. Sound is synchronous, meaning that if CorgiDS isn't running full speed, it sounds terrible. Even when running full speed, things sound a bit off. Even so, the sound was good enough that I got a bit sidetracked and played Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time for a couple of hours. 🙂As the year turns there are changes ahead for some of Seattle's most established cultural fixtures. Whether they will result in major shifts (or light revisions) of these prominent arts institutions is not fully known as new leadership takes over.

Here is a handy guide to some noteworthy exits and entrances of cultural execs:

Seattle Symphony Orchestra. After eight years winning ovations from musicians and audiences alike, as well as three Grammy Awards for the symphony's classical musical recordings, the dynamic French maestro Ludovic Morlot announced he'll be moving on after eight years as music director.

Though his official departure is in 2019, we are likely to get a good look at his successor this year who is no stranger to the symphony. Thomas Dausgaard, a Dane who is currently musical director of the Scottish Symphony Orchestra and the Swedish Chamber Orchestra, first conducted at SSO in 2003. In 2014 Dane was appointed the orchestra's principal guest conductor.

What can we expect from Dausgaard when he officially takes the helm? Likely more Scandinavian music. (He won plaudits here conducting in an SSO festival of works by the Finnish composer Sibelius.) Also, there's Dausgaard's good relations with SSO musicians and his lively, engaging personality at the podium. And one expects a continuation of the organization's successful attempts to reach out to young music lovers via a popular late-night concert series instituted by Morlot as well as commissions for new works by modern composers.

But the new maestro's direction will also depend on who serves as his administrative partner. President and chief executive Officer Simon Woods is leaving to manage the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and a search for the new SSO honcho is underway.

5th Avenue Theatre. This landmark showplace for musicals got a genuine impresario and a class act when David Armstrong was hired to guide it 18 years ago. Since then the decorous 5th Avenue has raised its national profile considerably as Armstrong and company have mounted new shows that went on to Broadway success – first and foremost "Hairspray," followed later by "Memphis," "Aladdin," and "A Christmas Story" and a workshop version of the current Times Square hit, "Come From Away."

There were other transfers that didn't do as well (including "Catch Me if You Can" and "Shrek") but that's showbiz. And on the great roulette wheel that is Broadway theater, Armstrong was willing to gamble and risk. He made A-list theater artists and producers welcome to develop and premiere fresh works in a try-out town that's as far as you can get in the Lower 48 from Broadway's bright lights.

David Armstrong

Just as meaningful to Seattle, Armstrong cultivated, encouraged and employed many local musical theater talents onstage and backstage. He introduced a new generation of patrons to modern shows and those from Broadway's golden era (from "Oklahoma!" to "Hair"). And he created an award program for high school musical theater.

Armstrong's stewardship of the ornate 1926 theater itself was exemplary. He and his board raised the money for and implemented major renovations of the extraordinary downtown venue without forsaking any of its luster and character.

Armstrong is moving on to concentrate more on developing, writing and directing projects. But he'll be consulting with his longtime 5th Avenue associate (and husband) Bill Berry, who will take the reins as producing artistic director, and with veteran 5th Avenue manager Bernadine "Bernie" Griffin.

Intiman Theatre. During Andrew Russell's eventful six-year tenure as artistic head and producer of Intiman, he managed to rescue it from near-bankruptcy and transform its mission from a more traditional drama company (founded in 1972) to a roving politically-charged troupe with a multicultural bent.

One can anticipate a continuation of the mission by Russell's successor Jennifer Zeyl. An award-winning, well-loved Seattle designer of sets and costumes for nearly 20 years, and a longtime Intiman staffer, Zeyl said in an interview on the company's website that she and new executive director Phillip Chavira will extend Russell's practice of naming a "co-curator" of color to help guide each season. (For 2018 that person will be theater artist-producer KJ Sanchez.)

Jennifer Zeyl

"We will hold underrepresented stories to the light, look at issues of identity, race, visibility, gender, coming-of-age, microaggression and an allegory on colonization," Zeyl emphasized. "All of this while centering new artists, unlikely combinations and lived true stories, reminding our audiences and artists alike that we are what makes America great."

Village Theatre. A hefty number of Eastsiders would rather forgo bridge-and-tunnel traffic to Seattle and get their fix of glossy stage musicals at this spiffy Issaquah showplace — where a Broadway regular will soon take charge.

What was a fairly modest community operation has grown over 25 years of guidance by artistic director Steve Tomkins and executive producer Robb Hunt into (by far) the largest professional theater company on the Eastside and in Everett, where Village's shows are presented at its satellite facility, the Everett Performing Arts Center.

Soon Jerry Dixon, a veteran New York director and actor, will take the artistic reins for the 2017-18 season and beyond. Dixon also is something of a known quantity here, after staging memorable Village versions of "The Full Monty" and "Show Boat."

Part of the Village's thrust has been workshopping and premiering musicals, but its mainstage seasons have been dominated by Broadway classics and well-known recent hits. Dixon wants to inject more risk and modernity by forgoing some of the old chestnuts (musical and dramatic) and unveiling additional new and contemporary material. He also wants to draw more national attention to the Village, and given his extensive Broadway theater contacts, the plan could work.

"Village Theatre has the ability and the infrastructure to do [new work] well," Dixon told The Seattle Times. "They have every step of the way of development. Now what they need is an ambassador to tell the world what they do so well."

On the Boards. This lower Queen Anne hub is a crucial venue for experimental drama, dance and music. And it has prospered under the 15-year guidance of vigorous, well-traveled artistic chief Lane Czaplinski, who recently departed to head up the larger Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio.

Now OTB is ushering in a new-to-Seattle leader with a background in the avant-garde world: Rachel Cook, former curator for Houston's multidisciplinary arts space DiverseWorks, and a fellow for the International Studio & Curatorial Program in New York.

Unlike some of the other incoming cultural brass here, Cook hasn't spent much time in Seattle. It is unclear whether she will continue all of OTB's current programs, and her predecessor's focus on importing exciting new works from Latin America, Europe and Asia, as well as nurturing home-grown offerings in the annual NW New Works Festival.

So it's wait-and-see time as Cook (working in tandem with OTB executive director Betsey Brock) familiarizes herself with the art and artists of the region and gradually puts her own stamp on the venue.

Other changes:

Seattle Repertory Theatre will bid adieu to associate artistic Marya Sea Kaminski, who has been appointed artistic chief of Pittsburgh Public Theatre. A hard-working and ingratiating actor-writer-director, Kaminski was a co-founder (like Zeyl) of Washington Ensemble Theatre, and most recently staged Rep's ambitious community production of "The Odyssey." No word yet if she will be replaced at Seattle Rep, or by whom.

New Century Theatre Company, a drama collective of leading Seattle theater artists, announced this fall it has ceased producing. The bad news is that we'll miss the creative rigor of this group (strongly exhibited over 10 years, in such shows as "The Adding Machine," "Festen" and "The Flick"). The good news is that these prime actors, directors and designers are working all over town, and bringing their sharp skills and lively sensibilities along with them.Autor de la ECyT-ar

A wide array of conservative leaders on the group's award committee voted on entrepreneurial courage and effectiveness in non-governmental efforts to preserve liberty and engage the public in 2017. In attendance at Washington, D.C.'s Trump International Hotel were many prominent leaders, including former Attorney General Ed Meese, Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas, former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke and most of the nonprofit organizations working on political or cultural efforts.

"Our opposition doesn't just disagree with us; they wish to destroy us because of what we believe in," I said as emcee for the event. The room was filled with national, state and local heroes, united in purpose, who spend their lives trying to preserve liberty for another generation.

"America and her institutions are under attack. We are warriors who hear and see it. We do not want to be fundamentally transformed. Too many citizens seem willing to throw away their own rights, at the expense of their neighbors," I said.

When receiving the first Outstanding Impact Award, multi-media megastar Sean Hannity accepted the honor "on behalf of every irredeemable, deplorable American who clings to God, their guns, their religion and their country." Hannity, who comes from humble beginnings as a dishwasher, cook, busboy bartender, and construction worker, sees every patriot who is understanding the battles waging to fundamentally transform America as critical to our success to preserve western civilization.

We are all "spokes on a wheel" and needed to preserve liberty and opportunity for another generation, Hannity told the crowd. "Let us wake up every day and be our spoke in the wheel, as every spoke matters. Let us do everything we can do to save our constitution, to work for the rule of law, to remember the forgotten men and women."

Hannity asked everyone to not forget that "there is an organized, well funded infrastructure that wants to undo an election they lost in 2016."

He also named five enemies of Trump; namely, the intelligence community, the "deep state," the Democratic Party, the corrupt and lying media, and the weak, spineless Republican team.

With good cheer, courage, and passion, he asked those assembled and representing the conservative movement, to stand in the gap of the void left by Republicans for moral and intellectual leadership to make America great again.

Other Impact awardees included Dr. Larry Arnn, who has been president of Hillsdale College since 2000. A brilliant constitutional scholar, Arnn asked whether private association is being extinguished in the face of growing governmental powers.

Dan Bongino, a TV commentator and former Secret Service agent, told the assembled, "It's a boxing match; keep punching back."

Center for Security Policy president Frank Gaffney told the group that we are "in the crosshairs of a 'red-green axis' which is transforming America through concerted efforts to defame, marginalize and silence their political adversaries in the current battle for the free world."

Charlie Kirk, founder and executive director of Turning Point USA, also received an Impact award. He said he believes the next generation can be even more conservative and freedom-loving than the last. However, he warned that "what is happening right now on college campuses is a fight for America's soul and for western civilization."

"We're going to win and they're going to lose," Kirk concluded.

Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, represents a group that battles for economic liberty and the rule of law against the tyranny of the growing administrative state's regulatory overreach. When receiving his award, Manning said "America is the greatest country in the world and failure is not an option" for any of us.

"We are in an electronic civil war. There is a conflict of visions between the people — propagandists, the main stream media — who manufacture consent versus the citizen press," said James O'Keefe, president of Project Veritas. He finds that too many Americans and leaders are afraid for their personal reputations and the humiliation possibility from the corrupt press.

"Moral courage means putting your reputation on the line. Personal defamation hurts but is a necessary part of triumph," O'Keefe added. "The enemy wants us to stop. And, they want to deter other people from doing what we do."

Star Parker, founder and president of the Center for Urban Renewal and Education has an inspirational life story, and was awarded for being an exemplary foot soldier for freedom. She goes into America's poorest communities and promotes "the three Cs — Christianity, capitalism and our Constitution." She also echoes former President Ronald Reagan when she says the answer to poverty is freedom and personal responsibility, not a welfare state.

Leonard Leo, the executive vice president of the Federalist Society, has transformed the legal culture through building an expanding number of lawyers, judges, state attorneys general to defend the structural Constitution that grants maximum liberties and allows human flourishing. In the absence of the battles over enforceable limits on arbitrary governmental power, all our rights and liberties are merely on parchment and can be made meaningless, he told the group in accepting his award.

Richard Viguerie, chairman of American Target Advertising, Inc., received the group's Lifetime Achievement award at age 84. Through effective marketing and direct mail, Viguerie has equipped conservative institutions and individuals for success since the 1960s. "Look out liberals, Viguerie is just getting started in his 80s," he said.

Viguerie also named many conservative giants from the 1940s; namely, Russell Kirk, Frank Meyer, Henry Regnery and others, whom we stand on in the conservative movement. He told the assembled not to be discouraged.

Quoting former Congressman Bob McEwen, Viguerie said, "If you can't see the hand of God in the 2016 election, you are deaf, dumb and blind."

One Baltimore, Md., pastor argued that more police need to patrol the city's neighborhoods in order to better protect the locals, according to an interview with NPR published Sunday.

"We wanted the police there," Rev. Kinji Scott told NPR. "We wanted them engaged in the community. We didn't want them beating the hell out of us, we didn't want that. We need the front line police officers and we need the heart of the black community to step to the forefront of this discussion. And that's when we're going to see a decrease in crime."

Baltimore reached 343 homicides last week as city leaders struggle to come up with ways to fix the violence. Mayor Catherine Pugh, a Democrat, released a holistic crime plan, aimed at cracking down on poverty, opening up access to local community colleges to students who might not be able to afford it and working to better train officers, while the city police commissioner touted the recent addition of new hires to the force.

The city has grappled with police brutality and strained relationships between police officers and the communities they serve after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, a black man who died from spinal cord injuries while in police custody.

Scott agreed that the community did not want officers harming them, but that the community needed good police officers willing to interact with and protect the neighborhood.

"And of course we want to delineate the whole culture of bad policing that exists — nobody denies that — but as a result of this, we don't see the level of policing we need in our community to keep the crime down in our cities that we are seeing bleed to death," Scott added to NPR.

The administration downsized permanent staff at all cabinet-level departments by the end of Sept. 2017, except for at Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs (VA) and Interior, The Washington Post reported Saturday. Hundreds of federal positions have been removed as a result of the administration's commitment to retool and shed some of the two million federal government employees.

The federal workforce grew sizably under both former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, ballooning from roughly 1.8 million employees in 2000 to 2.14 million at the height of Obama's presidency.

Trump's administration is moving at a historically slow pace in filling political positions at federal agencies, whether it be part of his "draining the swamp" promise or a slow movement on the part of the Senate is unclear.

The Senate has only confirmed 240 of the over 600 political appointments that are supposed to help carry out the administration's agenda.

Agencies the administration has chosen not to shrink do make some sense.

Keeping employment levels higher at Interior, the VA, and Homeland Security is in line with the Trump administration's "America First" policies, like its push for border security, improving veterans affairs and infrastructure spending, that is already shaping up to be the key legislative agenda of 2018.

Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and GOP leadership are looking to get infrastructure rolling out the gate in January, a goal they believe will get bipartisan support. Infrastructure has been a Democratic campaigning platform for decades, but the party's leadership is facing heat for failing to get a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals deal done in 2017 — a situation that could prove troubling for Republicans infrastructure push in the coming year.

In addition to its push to shed some of the federal workforce, the administration is trying deregulate the economy, slashing environmental, financial, and other federal regulations.

Tens of thousands of Iranians have taken to streets across the country to protest the ruling clerical elite and its foreign and domestic policies over the past four days. It is the largest mass demonstration against the regime since 2009, when then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won re-election in a widely disputed election.

The Iranian government warned protesters on Sunday they would face reprisal for the unauthorized demonstrations.

"Those who damage public property, violate law and order and create unrest are responsible for their actions and should pay the price," Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli said, according to a Reuters translation of state media.

What began Thursday as scattered protests over Iran's faltering economy quickly morphed into a countrywide uprising against the regime's endemic corruption and foreign interventions, which many Iranians see as the root causes of the country's economic malaise. Demonstrators have called on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down and even shouted "Long live Reza Shah," referring to the king who ruled Iran from 1925 to 1941 and was overthrown in the 1979 Iranian Revolution.

The demands break a political taboo in Iran, indicating a level of discontent that represents the single biggest political challenge to the regime since the revolution, which created the Islamic Republic.

Unlike the 2009 unrest, the protests over the weekend appear entirely spontaneous and without direction from opposition leaders. They have also extended far beyond Tehran, Iran's capital and cultural center of gravity, to smaller, more conservative cities throughout the country, suggesting widespread dissatisfaction with the regime.

Iran has a dual system of republican and clerical rule, but the supreme leader rules for life and is the head of armed forces. The arrangement gives Ayatollah Khamenei more power over foreign and economic policy than Hassan Rouhani, Iran's current elected president.

Rouhani came into office promising to expand rights to freedom of expression and assembly. He also said the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which is thus far his main achievement, would lead to better economic conditions as international sanctions were lifted as part of the agreement.

Those economic improvements have failed to materialize, with corrupt and incompetent clerical hardliners mismanaging critical economic sectors such as imports and energy. Joblessness is rampant — the unemployment rate in 2017 was over 12 percent — and prices for basic staples like eggs and poultry have soared in recent months.

Anger over the sputtering economy sparked this weekend's protests, however, political grievances have sustained the resistance through an increasingly harsh response by the regime. Demonstrators called for an end to clerical rule on Friday and Saturday and demanded the government roll back its costly intervention in Syria.

"Leave Syria alone, give a thought to us," protesters chanted, according to BuzzFeed News correspondent Borzou Daragahi.

The Trump's administration has issued several statements affirming support for the protesters and calling for reform. The State Department had harsh words for the Iranian regime on Friday, saying it has turned Iran into and "economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos."

President Donald Trump himself has tweeted three times about the unrest. He said on Sunday Washington would "closely" monitor the human rights situation in Iran.

"Big protests in Iran. The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism," Trump said on Twitter. "Looks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations!"

A book titled The Blockchain Economy should not really have a chapter devoted to Blockchain killers. If they succeed, I will need a new title – maybe something like The Decentralization Economy or The Value Exchange Economy or maybe even The Directed Acyclic Graph Economy (ok the last one is certainly too nerdy).

Bitcoin is the first use case for Blockchain technology. The serious doubts about Bitcoin as a currency and payment rail (while everybody celebrates Bitcoin as a store of value alternative to gold) have led to three types of alternative being proposed:

Alt 1. A new currency, also based on Blockchain, but faster & cheaper. These include Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC). The problem with all these alternatives is that they have not yet been tested at scale. If Blockchain is the fundamental problem, any Blockchain based coin will eventually hit the same problems. However if Bitcoin does not get its scaling act together soon, one of these alternatives might replace Bitcoin.

Alt 2. Multi Layer solutions for Bitcoin. These include technologies such as Segwit, Lightning Network, Sidechains, MimbleWimble and Schnorr Signatures, many of which are still under development/in testing. We will cover these in the next chapter.

Alt 3. An alternative to Blockchain. The basic idea is that Blockchain based verification is too expensive and slow so we need a fundamentally different technology. This chapter looks at two non-Blockchain based approaches – Tangle from IOTA and Hashgraph – that both share a technical approach known as Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

Alt 2 and Alt 3 are both at the "bleeding edge" of technology (where there is still technology risk). Money is made at the intersection between bleeding edge and "leading edge" (where it is accepted wisdom that the technology will change the world). If you wait until leading edge you may be too late. If you invest at the bleeding edge stage you face risk that it simply won't work at scale. Classic advice to investors is to be both contrarian and right (a lot harder to do than to say). Another way to say this is that investors need to be both early and right. You need to assess which wave to ride. This chapter is designed to help you figure out if the DAG wave is worth riding.

Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for Tamper Proof Distributed Ledger.

Technically, both IOTA/Tangle and Hashgraph are a form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The objective of both DAG and Blockchain technology is the same – to create a Tamper Proof Distributed Ledger.

We will look at the commercial aspects later, but it is important to demystify the technology which all too often gets pitched along these lines:

Blockchain verification is too slow/expensive to compete with credit card rails or handle micropayments. True.

Our technology was built by geniuses and don't try understanding it unless you have a PHD in Computer Science. This encourages naive investors and is mostly hype.

The most basic thing for a non-technical person to to understand is that Graph does not mean charts or other visuals. Graph is just a way of describing a network with many nodes (aka edges) and links between those nodes (aka vertices). Techies talk about edges and vertices but nodes and links are more understandable for non-technical folk. You can visualise the nodes as balls and links as lines between those nodes. Almost everything can be modelled as a network (aka graph) with nodes and links between nodes. That includes a payment network. In that sense the Bitcoin Blockchain and Visa are both graphs/networks.

A DAG – Directed Acyclic Graph – has similar properties to a Blockchain in that in both cases the nodes are directed from earlier to later in a sequence.

IOTA Tangle – the case for and against

IOTA is currently No 6 on CoinMarketCap with a valuation of over $12 billion. The elevator pitch is Crypto + Internet Of Things (IOT). They aim to be the data marketplace for data streaming from IOT devices. The basic idea is that the data from those devices should be liberated from siloed systems so that device owners can profit from "their data". The elevator pitch is clearly resonating.

The basic facts are:

IOTA calls it a Tangle, but it is basically a DAG.

IOTA does not have miners. The transaction is verified at the edge/node. Like Blockchain, the verification users a cryptographic puzzle that needs to solved. The difference is that the verification/puzzle solving is done at the edge/node. That sounds good because decentralization is good.

Enterprise validation comes from these companies in the IOTA pilot – Microsoft, Deutsche Telekom, and Fujitsu. Anybody who knows the enterprise space does not place much weight on big name validation because enterprises hedge their bets with lots of small pilot investments. For example, look at all the members of Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.

The case against IOTA is simple – maybe it is fast and cheap, but maybe it is not secure. In the social media age, fast and cheap ruled. The Facebook mantra – move fast and break things – guided thousands of startups. In the value exchange era, when real hard-earned assets change hands, the old enterprise mantra is "test, test and test again" and "it will be ready when it is ready". Get it wrong in the social media age and a photo lands in the wrong place. Get it wrong in the value exchange era and criminal gangs will find ways to steal millions.

In August, researchers from MIT and Boston University reported a "serious vulnerability".

That was not the end of the matter. Doubts continue to circulate for example in this post on HackerNoon. Read it if you want to understand the technical issues. For a non-technical person, the IOTA reaction to this security flaw being exposed was damming. Sergey Ivancheglo, Iota's cofounder, said that the flaws were in fact deliberate; that they were inserted as 'copy protection', to prevent copycat projects, and to allow the Iota team to compromise those projects if they sprang up. That was a standing joke in the enterprise software world when a bug was discovered, but nobody would have issued that as a press release! This shows a disturbing lack of judgement and is the kind of reputational issue that can kill a project.

Getting developer adoption in the open source community is critical. That is how Bitcoin and Ethereum grew. This reaction on HackerNoon is a problem for IOTA:

"It's an admission of hostile intent towards the open-source community, akin to publishing a recipe but leaving out a critical step, rendering the resulting dish poisonous to anyone who eats it. It's also very revealing of Iota's attitude towards open source; they do not release code open source because they want to make it freely available to all and advance the state of the art, but rather because it serves their purposes in gaining adoption for their own deployment of that code."

Hashgraph for Enterprise Permissioned Distributed Ledgers

The technology used by IOTA and Hashgraph is fundamentally the same. There are nuances of course, but that is like describing the difference between two different RDBMSs.

The deciding factor maybe commercial, where Hashgraph and IOTA have taken fundamentally different approaches

Hashgraph looks like an enterprise technology solution. They have proprietary, patented technology. This is the opposite of the open source + speculative coin ICO method of financing (which is what IOTA uses). The proprietary, patented technology approach is perfectly suited to enterprise permissioned networks. That is a big market and Hashgraph is really an alternative to solutions such as Ripple or R3 or Hyperledger. One can imagine a big inter-enterprise network such as SWIFT looking at Hashgraph DAG as an alternative to enterprise Blockchain solutions.

What really differentiates a private permissioned system from a public permissionless is the incentives built into the network. A private permissioned system does not need an external incentive system. The node is owned by a corporation that has a business model

There are many other DAG contenders to replace Blockchain.

These include Byteball and DAGCoin. Hashgraph and IOTA are simply better known. Both reference DAG in their pitch. If DAG replaces Blockchain this is a race to claim the DAG platform winner's slot. Or DAG may become another footnote in tech history.

Blockchain based Proof Of Work proponents use a typical incumbent defence:

"it may be expensive & slow, but it works and we are working on the scaling".

That would be a totally inadequate response if the DAG alternative to Blockchain was proven at scale (which it is not). In next week's chapter we will look at the Bitcoin Blockchain scaling technology in the pipeline.

Like this: Like Loading...Too many Kings.

LA had too many shots and too many goals, but it was missed too many men penalty by the referees that allowed the Kings to secure victory on Saturday.

Coming off arguably one of their best games of the season against Chicago on Thursday, the Canucks returned to form. Albeit, in an entertaining game.

There were defensive miscues, they were badly out shot-attempted, and yet they found a way to keep it close.

Troy Stecher, Nikolay Goldobin, and Nic Dowd all scored for Vancouver but it was not enough as the Canucks fell to the Kings 4-3.

Here's what happened.

1. The winning goal

After Drew Doughty was embarrassed by Goldobin earlier in the game (we'll get to that later), he answered right back in the third with a solo effort of his own.

Drew Doughty continues to do Drew Doughty things, gives the LA Kings a 4-3 lead over the Vancouver Canucks 😎 pic.twitter.com/JqLNSZEXNQ — LA Kings (@LAKings) December 31, 2017

That was the eventual game-winner, but it shouldn't have counted.

As Doughty entered the Canucks zone, the Kings obviously had too many men on the ice.

That's six LA players by the looks of it. It was a missed call and it's not reviewable, but my question is why shouldn't it be? If we can go back 2 minutes and reverse a goal because someone was offside, why can't the NHL do the same in regards to a black and white penalty such as too many men?

Needless to say, fans were not pleased.

He invited two extra Kings out on to the ice as well and said "watch this!" https://t.co/Mdk7tNNx0d — Justin Morissette (@JustinMoris) December 31, 2017

You should be able to challenge that — DK (@khatinthekar) December 31, 2017

Then after the game, Hockey Night in Canada attempted to pull the "well actually" on everyone.

Hockey Night in Canada ran this nonsense in the post-game show tonight. Trying to say #Canucks had 7 players on the ice so Kings too many men was a wash. VAN players were right at the bench doing a line change though. LA had too many for a while, not in front of their own bench. pic.twitter.com/iiO2JxBd7O — Rob Williams (@RobTheHockeyGuy) December 31, 2017

There's a difference between a line change at your own bench and refusing to leave the ice to skate over to the other team's bench.

2. The rise of Troy

It was an eventful game tonight from Stecher. First, the Richmond native managed to score his first of the year from a tough angle.

Then, he channeled his inner Erik Karlsson on this near end to end rush.

And to cap it all off, he nearly joined the likes of Tanev and Horvat on the IR.

Stecher appears to hurt his hand after a heavy hit into the boards pic.twitter.com/9tGsq2Tc4p — Wyatt Arndt (@TheStanchion) December 31, 2017

Thankfully, he managed to return to the game because I can't imagine how much worse the defence would look without someone as solid as Stecher out. He finished with 18:16 of ice time and was the only Canucks defenceman with a positive Corsi percentage.

3. Goldy's goal

Since getting called up from Utica, Goldobin has been in and out of the lineup, unable really to become a constant player for the Canucks. He's shown flashes of his offensive upside but hasn't earned the trust of Travis Green yet.

Maybe that changes after this game because he scored a brilliant goal that tied it at two.

Nikolay Goldobin with a great effort to tie the game at 2#Canucks pic.twitter.com/DilvkgmSoi — Ryan Biech (@ryanbiech) December 31, 2017

That's none other than Norris trophy winner Drew Doughty he embarrassed. Despite this, however, he had less than 10 minutes of ice time. Only Michael Chaput played less.

4. Changing of the guard

Guess who led the Canucks in ice time tonight?

It wasn't a Sedin, it wasn't a defenceman. It was Brock Boeser.

He had a whopping 23:46 of total ice time during the game, a career high.

He also led the team with four shots on net. After being scratched his first two games, it's great to see Travis Green giving Boeser the ice time he definitely deserves, though he admitted after the game he may have overplayed him.

5. Free fallin' for Dahlin

Lost amongst all the hype for Boeser is the fact that the Canucks are once again in the hunt for the first overall pick. Here are the standings after this game, much to the delight of the #TeamTank faithful.

It will be hard for Arizona to catch up, and maybe even Buffalo at this point, but it's possible that Vancouver could be 29th by season's end.

If they could get their hands on Rasmus Dahlin, that would be a game changer. For all the exciting forward prospects the Canucks have, outside of Olli Juolevi they don't have a defenceman that can really move the needle for them.

Button on Dahlin: "There is no better player available for the 2018 draft. He is going no.1" 🇸🇪 #WJC18 pic.twitter.com/cp9fMvXEz2 — NHL Prospects Watch (@Prospects_Watch) December 28, 2017

As brilliantly illustrated by Janik Beichler, the Canucks have potentially the makings of a lethal power play unit with Boeser and Elias Pettersson on opposite sides. Add Dahlin to the mix, and you could have something special.

Plus, it would be fun to make Dahlin/Dahlen jokes.

6. SixPack Superstar: Jacob Markstrom

He let in four goals but it could have been worse without Markstrom between the pipes.

When you're badly out possessed like the Canucks were in this one, to keep the score within one is impressive.

Next up for the Canucks is a home game against the Anaheim Ducks on January 2nd, the last before seven-game road trip.

See alsoAccording to ComScore this morning, the 2017 domestic box office for the period of Jan. 1-Dec. 31 rings in at $11.12 billion, which is the third best ever, and the third time that the B.O. has crossed that mark for the third consecutive year in a row. Disney for the third year ever has grossed north of $2 billion annually in U.S./Canada ticket sales. Here's a breakdown of what went right and wrong stateside for those majors with more than 4% marketshare. This year's ticket sales are 2.3% down from last year's $11.4 billion all-time domestic record.

Disney

DISNEY ($2.4 billion, -20% from 2016, 21.6% marketshare)

What went right: Marvel, Lucasfilm, their live action animated pics and half of Pixar (Coco). But more than those brands, Disney guarantees that they win all around: commercially, critically and audience-wise. You can't make it with less than that in this social media era. If you want to know how Disney works, Kevin Feige's insight on Marvel's secret to success says plenty: "We keep plus-ing, and plus-ing and plus-ing which is an old Walt Disney term. It's the mindset we have." Disney also bought 20th Century Fox, which depending on when the merger goes through, could arguably increase their annual marketshare to close to 40%. If both studios were unified this year, their combined marketshare would have been 34.4%. Disney owned four spots in the 2017's top 10, including the top two slots respectively with Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Beauty and the Beast. Last year they owned six lots with Pixar's Finding Dory and Lucasfilm's Rogue One: A Star Wars Story in the top two.

Disney

What they need to do: As the leading major studio excelling with franchises, they have to watch that they don't over do it. No one stateside was asking for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales or Cars 3, both titles registered their series' lowest domestic takes respectively with $172.6M and $152.9M. How low can you go? (There's an argument that we got a fifth Pirates because it could still sell overseas, which it did as global came in close to $800M). The age-old question which their development department needs to continually grapple with is: Why a sequel? The argument can be made that moviegoers will always flock more to sequels than original IPs, however, a fifth Pirates and a third Cars didn't help with this summer's B.O. ecosystem (overall the lowest for the industry in 11 years). Having Fox's side of the Marvel equation will help them in taking their comic book fare to another level.

Disney/Marvel

What's next: Finally seeing a win at the Memorial Day box office with Solo: A Star Wars Story after a string of annual misfortunes including Prince of Persia, Tomorrowland, Alice Through the Looking Glass, and Pirates 5. Disney has 11 tight releases to get it right and win 2018 again, and they'll definitely make waves with Marvel's Black Panther, The Incredibles 2 and A Wrinkle in Time to name a few. Also, of course, after the merger goes through, it will be interesting to see if they leave 20th Century Fox as independent as they left Miramax which in its heyday would churn out 25 releases of varying budget sizes.

WARNER BROS. (2017 Domestic B.O.: $2.035 billion, +7%, 18% marketshare)

What went right: This year was Warner's second best year ever stateside after 2009. Worldwide of $5.135 billion, reps an all-time studio record. They had more No. 1 openings than any other studio, totaling eight. They're also tied with Disney in having seven titles come in over $100M. While their DC label continued to struggle with Justice League, they greatly succeeded with Wonder Woman which was the third-highest grossing film of 2017 at $412.5M. They got there by marketing the film as a female empowerment anthem, something that spoke to female moviegoers in these vitriolic Trump times. Part of that boils down to

Warner Bros

stealing a page out of the Marvel playbook by hiring an indie auteur, Monster's Patty Jenkins, to put their spin on a comic book adaptation. Those filmmakers crossing over from the indie world into comic-book fare such as Jenkins, Jon Watts (Sony's Spider-Man: Homecoming) and Taika Waititi (Disney's Thor: Ragnarok) are directors who aren't simply all about the visual razzle-dazzle but are well-versed in edgy, colorful storytelling. Also, Warners continued to bet on clever directors with a voice who work commercially, read Christopher Nolan with Dunkirk. For all the studio's potholes in Geostorm and King Arthur; when they got it right, they got it right. They pulled off a box office feat that no other studio in the history of Hollywood could ever pull off: not only launching the biggest horror hit of all-time with Stephen King's It ($123.4M opening, $327.4M domestic, $698M global) but miraculously doing so in the post-Labor Day dead zone following a ruthless summer.

What they need to do: Stop overspending on tired, half-baked IP — specifically franchises they're trying to start, read Geostorm and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. If it's risky, keep the budget low. Don't burn down the lot. If it's not working after a year in development in the script stage, just step away (gulp —their take on the Jungle Book, Mowgli, which has been on the shelf for some years opens in the middle of October). When it comes to making original fare at a cost, Warner Bros. simply needs to look to their fellow New Line execs who've made the horror division work with edgy filmmakers on thrifty budgets. Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group president and chief content officer Toby Emmerich is already taking steps to make DC work by reorganizing internal staffs after Justice League failed to be DC's Avengers. Lastly, with comedies on life support, Warners (and New Line) has to step away from schtick (The House, Fist Fight, Father Figures, Chips) and figure out how to reinvigorate the genre again in the post-Hangover era.

WB

What's next: Does Clint Eastwood's The 15:17 to Paris strike the heartland like American Sniper did? Does Steven Spielberg have a big hit with the YA generation with his feature adaptation of Ready Player One? Ocean's 8 female role reversal looks less daunting and more organic than Sony's Ghostbusters. After Aquaman, will horror maestro James Wan inherit the oversee of the DC franchise?

UNIVERSAL ($1.53 billion, +9%, 13.7% marketshare)

What went right: A diverse slate from a mix of tried and true franchises like Fate of the Furious and Despicable Me 3, two of four titles that crossed $1 billion worldwide in 2017, and Blumhouse microbudget wonders Split and Get Out. Both titles, especially the latter pic by Jordan Peele, served as reminders as to why certain low budget features shouldn't make a bee-line directly onto streaming services. They proved that there's vibrancy in the theatrical window for smart, original fare, and moviegoers will buy into that.

Universal Pictures

What they need to do: Uni, like other studios, is in need of more franchises. However, there's a delicate balance when it comes to rebooting. They made it work with Jurassic World, but couldn't make a Tom Cruise-Russell Crowe Mummy click (much of that had to do with the creators driving that ship).

What's next: More Blumhouse which like Marvel is trying to keep most of what they're developing a surprise. While horror reboots of yore haven't worked in recent times (i.e. Rings, Amityville: The Awakening), Blumhouse is going to try and breathe fresh air into Halloween under the hand of David Gordon Green. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom will certainly stoke all crowds, and Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again should win over women. Hopefully, Peter Jackson's is on the verge of a new franchise with his post-apocalyptic future series Mortal Engines.

20TH CENTURY FOX ($1.43 billion, -7%, 12.8% marketshare)

What went right: For the second time in the row, they pulled off a commercially successful R-rated superhero title in Logan, triggering additional excitement for the X-Men brand and proving that fanboys are thirsting for a more adult spin on big screen comic books. Similar to other studios, they proved that moviegoing isn't just about event titles, but that riveting, true-story dramas (Hidden Figures) and all-star ensemble classical fare geared at older adults (Murder on the Orient Express) can break out. "It all has to do with how the movie is positioned in the marketplace," says one insider about their recipe for Fox's success.

20th Century Fox

What they need to do: They have to stay alive in a Disney merger era, and prove that there is a great demand among moviegoers for the studio's slate and tastes. Give Disney an option they can't refuse. While Fox was content with Kingsman: The Golden Circle, a couple of their franchises didn't go the way as planned. In some cases that boils to an auteur losing sight of the franchise that made him (Ridley Scott's Alien: Covenant) and a threequel that was more brooding, darker, and fell short of living up to its title (War for the Planet of the Apes, the lowest in the series at $146.9M domestic, didn't necessarily deliver a full-scale onslaught war of apes).

What's next: Deadpool 2, proof that R-rated comedies continue to work, but as superheroes. There are some fresh layers of the X-Men series in spinoffs New Mutants, which they're selling as a horror title, and Simon Kinberg's Dark Phoenix. Can Jennifer Lawrence reteaming with her Hunger Games director Francis Lawrence spark a new series with the adaptation of the Russian spy novel Red Sparrow?

Sony

SONY ($1.06 billion, +16%, 9.5% marketshare)

What went right: With Spider-Man: Homecoming they revived the Marvel property for the third time in a row in a way that other studios haven't with their own franchises. Most of that stems from teaming with Disney/Marvel boss Kevin Feige. Sony made originality work at a cost with Edgar Wright's car heist ballet Baby Driver. Also, who knew everyone still loved Jumanji? Sony did and they found a way to resuscitate it for the social media/video game age with Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle which in ten days already beat the original's gross with a running B.O. of $170.3M. Also, just when you thought certain brands were dead, they're alive overseas (read Resident Evil: The Final Chapter grossed less than 9% of its $312.2M global B.O. in U.S./Canada).

Marvel/Screenshot

What they need to do: Sometimes when they were trying to be original, there was a same-old, same-old feel to some of Sony's titles and that showed at the box office, read the party-hardy Rough Night, the Alien knockoff Life and the legal drama Roman J. Israel, Esq.

What's next: There's a lot of heat around the Spider-Man spinoff Venom which should boost October in a way that Blade Runner 2049 did not. Studio 8's drug thriller White Boy Rick looks to spark mid-August. Peter Rabbit will be a family destination in early February while a cool animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse at the end of 2018 shouldn't be discounted.

LIONSGATE ($885M, +33%, 7.9% marketshare)

What went right: With a combination of foreign sales and partners like Participant Media (on their $200M-global grossing hit Wonder), they're able to make unique and edgy IP work with mainstream audiences including La La Land, John Wick 2, and the summer sleeper The Hitman's Bodyguard.

What they need to do: After huge millennial hits with Twilight and The Hunger Games, the world awaits another huge franchise. In addition, attempts to revive old ones (Jigsaw) and new ones (American Assassin didn't find the Dylan O'Brien audiences) fell flat. While they've been risk-averse in giving up foreign, there's another mindset which believes that Lionsgate is giving up the best part of the box office as international ticket sales boom.

What's next: The next iteration of Hellboy, the Leonardo DiCaprio-produced gritty take on Robin Hood, and the Mila Kunis-Kate McKinnon comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me.

PARAMOUNT ($534.2M, -39%, 4.8% marketshare)

What went right: Not a lot. This year was the Melrose Lot's lowest take at the box office in more than 17 years. Transformers: The Last Knight was their highest-grossing title of the year with $605M and their lowest in the series. Last Knight beat this franchise into the ground with a marketing campaign and a fifth installment that didn't distinguish itself from its predecessors. But with $228.8M in ticket sales, Paramount made a fifth Transformers for China alone. While other studios failed with comedies this year, Paramount won with its PG-13 Will Ferrell/Mark Wahlberg sequel Daddy's Home 2 ($100M), even beating out the other edgy holiday comedy, A Bad Moms Christmas ($71.7M) which opened the weekend before. It's just proof that families like heart more than raunch when it comes to their Christmas comedies (last year Par had DreamWorks' ensemble adult comedy Office Christmas Party which did not work on a massive level at $54.8M).

Paramount

What they need to do: Not commit the same mistakes as the prior administration of late Brad Grey/Rob Moore with overtired brands and overspending on prestige, offbeat, specialty product (read $68M for Alexander Payne's befuddled Downsizing; acquiring the nowhere Suburbicon for north of $10M). But it already looks like they're shaking up the seltzer bottle in 2019 and beyond with an R-rated Star Trek in development, a revival of classic 1980s franchise with Top Gun, a female spy film from the 007 producers Eon Productions with The Rhythm Section, plus they're jumping on the Stephen King revival bandwagon with Pet Sematary.

What's next: Let's see if Bumblebee can raise the bing-bang-boom of the Transformers to a mature level we haven't seen before storywise. The new studio administration will continue to be plagued with the sings of the previous one, and won't finally sing until 2019. Hopefully Mission: Impossible 6 can beat the Tom Cruise fatigue which took place this year with The Mummy and American Made.I ship elsa&anna and my pixiv id is 1278173Ich stimme der Verwendung von Cookies für die Zwecke der Webanalyse und digitaler Werbemaßnahmen zu.

UPDATE 1800 GMT: Appearing on State TV, President Rouhani has walked a line between declaring a right to protest and warning people to stay within acceptable limits in their demonstrations.

Rouhani said people must feel that they can express themselves, but he emphasized that the Government "will not tolerate those who want to destroy public buildings or riot in the streets".

He rephrased this at another point: "The expectations and demands of the people are correct. But it is not acceptable to choose a path that creates problems or makes the enemy happy.

Analyst Siavush Randjbar-Daemi notes the vaguenes of Rouhani's statement regarding the political and economic issues behind the demonstrations, invoking the precedent reformist President Mohammad Khatami during the 1999 Tehran protests:

Rouhani's first reaction to recent events not dissimilar to Khatami in 1999: meek acceptance of grievances, but little in terms of practical concessions. Nothing for example on revising the budget, and its measures concerning lower income strata of society. — Siavush Randjbar-Daemi (@AmuChelengar) December 31, 2017

Journalist Arash Karami summarizes:

I didn't notice anything ground breaking in Rouhani's speech. He accepts criticism on the economy and corruption and seems to agree with it. However, he also wants order in society (he was Secretary of Supreme National Security Council for 16 years after all). — Arash Karami (@thekarami) December 31, 2017

UPDATE 1745 GMT: Protest in Tehran this evening:

People on Kargar Avenue chanting "Death to the Dictator":

UPDATE 1030 GMT: Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli has issued the latest response of the Rouhani Government to the protests.

Fazli said, "The events and incidents in recent days have caused concern, unease and unhappiness for our dear people."

He did not address the economic or political causes of the demonstrations but emphasized that the Government, Parliament, and judiciary are determined to follow up claims to solve problems.

Most of Fazli's statement was a denunciation of protesters, saying that they are hindering security, production, and employment. He said, "They are after causing violence and fear. Of course, such behavior will be smashed."

ORIGINAL ENTRY: Thousands of Iranians continued protests over economic and political issues for a third day on Saturday, with the regime unable to check the discontent despite its counter-rally of support.

There were marches in almost every city, including the capital Tehran. Crowds burned photos of Iranian leaders — including the Supreme Leader and General Qassem Soleimani, the head of the elite Quds Forces — and of the paramilitary Basij while continuing chants targeting the Leader such as "Death to the Dictator" and "Shame on you, Seyyed Ali Khamenei. Let the country go."

Iran Daily, Dec 30: Regime Shaken as 1000s Protest in Almost All Cities Across Country

The Governor's building in Khorramabad in western Iran was reportedly set ablaze after claims that police had shot dead four protesters in Lorestan Province. Videos on social media from the town of Dorud showed two young men lying motionless on the ground, covered with blood. An Iranian journalist confirmed the death, naming the men as Hamzeh Lashni and Hossein Reshno.

Habibollah Khojastepour, the Deputy Governor of Lorestan Province, maintained, "It is clear that two protestors were killed by ISIS and foreign agents." However, an MP from the province justified the use of force, saying police could do nothing but kill "those who crossed the boundaries".

Elsewhere, most rallies were peaceful, but in Iran's second city Mashhad a police motorcycle was set afire and footage from Rasht reportedly showed police cars alight.

Video also showed clashes between security forces and young men in Ahwaz in southern Iran.

Fars News, linked to the Revolutionary Guards, claimed only 70 people turned out in Tehran, but videos showed larger gatherings. The Islamic Students News Agency said police shut two metro stations to prevent even more protesters, and security forces used clubs to disperse people. Participants in the protest spoke of beatings, detentions, and pursuit by riot police.

Brigadier-General Esmail Kowsari, the Revolutionary Guards' deputy security chief in Tehran, insisted the situation was under control and warned protesters would face "the nation's iron fist": "If people came into the streets over high prices, they should not have chanted those slogans and burned public property and cars."

Regime Searches for a Response

The regime continued to scramble for an effective response. Its attempt for a show of support by "millions" — planned long before last week's events but given urgency by developments — only drew about 4,000 people in central Tehran and an unknown number of people in other cities and towns. Warnings by Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli that people should "not participate in...illegal gatherings as they will create problems for themselves and other citizens", and by the Revolutionary Guards that they "will not allow the country to be hurt" appeared to have no effect.

First Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri insisted on Saturday that the initial cause of the demonstrations was without basis, claiming the Iranian economy is "on the right track" despite "certain shortcomings" — although he did acknowledged that "the prices of several commodities may have seen a rise due to some incidents". He called on those behind the demonstrations to be identified, and for all groups to work to solve Iran's problems.

Last night authorities reportedly tried to stem the demonstrations by cutting or limiting communications. Connections to the internet wer restricted, and satellite broadcasting was jammed. The popular messaging service Telegram shut down one channel, Amad News, after authorities said it was inciting violence.

Official and semi-official media finally acknowledged the protests in their English-language outlets, but only as an opportunity to blame them on US interference. State broadcaster IRIB said on its website that it had not covered the protests because it was told by authorities that "the issue should not be reflected on state radio and television".

The government gives an excludable good away for free: roads, parks, education, medicine, whatever. Then some economist advocates privatization of one of these freebies. Technocrats may offer some technical objections to privatization. Normal people, however, will respond with a disgusted rhetorical question: "So only the rich should have roads/parks/education/medicine/whatever."

A straw man? Not really. As I've explained, a straw man is when you falsely attribute a silly argument to your opponents. But "Only the rich..." is an argument the opponents of privatization routinely embrace.

But what exactly is so silly about the "only the rich" argument?

1. Some free government services would remain quite affordable after privatization. These goods certainly wouldn't "only be for the rich." This is especially clear if (a) government subsidies are currently driving up prices or (b) privatization paves the way for broad-based tax cuts.

2. Suppose that after privatization, the formerly free goods become quite pricey. The non-rich could still afford them by making their purchase a priority. In the current regime, for example, boats are pretty expensive. But many people of modest means still own boats because they make boat ownership a priority, sacrificing other goods and services to free up funds for the activity they intensely value. Prioritizing is especially effective in the long-run because motivated people can and do save money to build up a nest-egg.

3. The market often offers expensive full-price products and affordable substitutes side-by-side. In a free market, for example, driving during peak time would probably be very expensive. But tolls earlier or later in the day would be far cheaper.

4. If they plan ahead, the non-rich can often afford extremely expensive products by buying insurance. Even if the rates aren't cheap, insurance is the classic way to transform devastating financial shocks into manageable financial burdens.

5. Where all else fails, the non-rich can turn to borrowing and charity.

Intelligent critics are likely to blame me for being overly literal. Of course "Only the rich will have X" is hyperbole. But it's a poetic way to lament the inequities of the market mechanism. But I say the intelligent critics are interpreting populist rhetoric far too charitably.

If literally true, the hyperbolic arguments would be powerful objections to privatization. If privatization will genuinely deprive all non-rich people of all medicine, we probably shouldn't privatize. But if the worst you can say about privatization is, "Rich people will have more and better medicine," the obvious retorts are: "Rich people already have more and better medicine," followed by "That's the whole point of money – to get more and better stuff."

In short, the "Only the rich" catchphrase isn't merely a childish overstatement. Like most political hyperbole, it's effective because adults take it literally. As I've said before:

Why are proponents of government action so prone to hyperbole? Because it's rhetorically effective, of course. You need wild

claims and flowery words to whip up public enthusiasm for government

action. Sober weighing of probability, cost, and benefit damns with

faint praise – and fails to overcome public apathy.

What would it take to transform "only the rich" populist demagoguery into serious policy analysis? Simple: Critics of the market could argue that the marginal improvement in incentives isn't worth the marginal costs of higher inequality. Of course, once you frame the issue that way, it's a short jump from critic to agnostic.For the first time in history, the Food and Drug Administration has approved a digital pill for tracking medications.

The digital pill, known as Abilify MyCite, has a sensor that keeps track whether a patient has ingested his/her medication. The ingestible sensor is embedded in the pill and will record the date of when the drug has been taken.

The gathered information will then be transmitted to a smartphone application through a patch worn by the patient.

The app will enable patients to add their mood and the hours they rested. They will also have the option to upload the information to a database that physicians and others who have the patient's permission can access.

Abilify MyCite is made by the Japan-based pharmaceutical company, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, and is the brand-name version of aripiprazole.

Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic drug specifically used to treat mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and is also prescribed as an add-on treatment for depression in adults.

On the other hand, the sensor fitted in the pill is manufactured by Proteus Digital Health, a California-based company which focuses on providing tools needed to provide an "efficient, patient-centric approach to measure, manage and improve the health of patient populations."

FDA-Approved Digital Pill Received Criticism

Despite the potential benefits of the digital pill, many medical experts disapprove its usage. Some are already referring to it as a "biological big Brother" and is highly suspicious because the sensor will be combined with a drug used to treat mental illness.

Given the fact that most people who suffer from schizophrenia experience paranoia and delusions, it puzzles health experts why the first digital drug to be approved is an antipsychotic.

In a statement to the New York Times, Dr. Paul Appelbau, Director of law, Ethics, and Psychiatry at Columbia University's psychiatry department, said:

"Many of those patients don't take meds because they don't like side effects, or don't think they have an illness, or because they become paranoid about the doctor or the doctor's intentions."

"A system that will monitor their behavior and send signals out of their body and notify their doctor? You would think that, whether in psychiatry or general medicine, drugs for almost any other condition would be a better place to start than a drug for schizophrenia."

However, despite people's concern about the pill's cost and possible effects on a patient's privacy, FDA remains positive and still view their decision as a big step for digital medicine.

"Being able to track ingestion of medications prescribed for mental illness may be useful for some patients," Dr. Mitchell Mathis, director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said. "The FDA supports the development and use of new technology in prescription drugs and is committed to working with companies to understand how technology might benefit patients and prescribers."

Dr. Walid Gellad, co-Director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh, also sees the upsides to a pill with a built-in sensor. While the drug may not look appealing to patients, he pointed out that it might appeal to caregivers and family members who need to keep track of their patient's medication.

At the moment, FDA, in a statement to The Wall Street Journal, expects an influx of approval request for other digital pills. It was reported that FDA is planning to hire more software developers with "deep understanding" of medical-related devices.

Would you take a digital pill to keep track of your medication given the fact that other people could access the information?? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below!Story highlights The dismissals come after six members resigned in June

This week's announcement states that the move is part of the Trump administration's effort to "bring in new voices"

Washington (CNN) The Trump administration has terminated the appointments of the remaining members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS, a statement from the council's executive director confirmed this week.

The dismissals come after six members resigned in June , citing "a President who simply does not care," according to a Newsweek op-ed written by one member at the time.

The move is part of the Trump administration's effort to "bring in new voices," the council's executive director B. Kaye Hayes said in a statement. But the jettisoned members are also encouraged to reapply to the new council, which will begin in 2018.

"The current members of Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA) received a letter informing them that the administration was terminating their appointments," Hayes said.

"Changing the makeup of federal advisory committee members is a common occurrence during Administration changes," she added, noting that similar moves were made by both the Obama and George W. Bush administrations.

Read More(CNN) In 2017, two states -- Virginia and New Jersey -- chose new governors. There were seven special elections in the House and one big one -- Alabama -- in the Senate. Big cities like New York, Atlanta and Boston held mayoral elections.

In that slew of races, a handful of candidates stood out -- some for how good they were, others for how, um, not good they were.

Below I've picked the single best political candidate of 2017 -- and a few who deserve honorable mention as well. Stay tuned for the "winner" of the worst candidate of 2017 in a separate, future post.

WINNER: Ralph Northam

Lots and lots of people underestimated Northam in 2017. I was one of them.

As long as three years ago, influential Democrats in Virginia were fretting to me about the idea of Northam as their gubernatorial candidate in 2017. The sitting lieutenant governor had the bad rap of being a boring guy from the wrong part of the state. He would lose a race that should be winnable for Democrats in the increasingly blue commonwealth.

When former Rep. Tom Perriello announced he would meet Northam in a primary, there was an expectation that it would be a very close race -- despite the fact that Perriello got a very late start and faced almost united establishment support for Northam.

Polling in the run-up to the June primary suggested Perriello had momentum. Turned out that wasn't the case. Northam cruised, 56% to 44% , over the talented Perriello.

Northam's convincing primary win didn't turn doubters into believers, however. (Me included!) There was considerable hand-wringing that the matchup between Northam and the more polished Ed Gillespie (R) would work against Democrats.

In the final days of the general election, Democrats openly worried that Northam was blowing the race -- from his strangled explanation of his position on sanctuary cities to his seeming hedge on Donald Trump just months after he had called the President a "narcissistic maniac."

"For months, the assumption has been that Ralph Northam would be elected Virginia governor on Tuesday night. Now, with just hours remaining before polls open in the commonwealth, the race suddenly looks like a toss-up between Northam, the Democratic lieutenant governor, and former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie."

Swing and a miss!

Northam beat Gillespie by 9 points -- a far wider margin than most people (and most polls) had expected.

Northam's 2017: two races, two overperformances. Why? This quote, from a smart Democratic insider to me in the final days of the general election, nails it: "[Northam] is running a campaign that is true to him. Mainstream, practical, continue Virginia's progress."

Northam knew who he was -- low key, steady -- and hewed to that throughout the year. He didn't waver when Perriello got into the race. He didn't panic when polling suggested Gillespie was within striking distance. He just kept running as a man comfortable in his own skin.

And he won. Twice. Easily.

But Parnell ran the best race of any Democrat in a House special election this year -- coming within 3,000 votes of pulling off a massive upset in the South Carolina 5th District seat previously held by Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney. (Trump carried the district by 18 points in 2016.) That's a remarkable showing for someone who had never run for elected office before. How did he do it? Wrote Politico's Bill Scher in a piece touting Parnell's as the best Democratic campaign of 2017: "By staying out of the line of fire. He was positive. He was humble. And Republicans barely knew he was there." As Scher notes, Parnell's self-effacing, anti-politician ads also helped.

He and his partner of Watergate reporting fame, Bob Woodward, drew parallels between Trump and Nixon

Washington (CNN) Veteran journalist Carl Bernstein said Sunday that President Donald Trump's lawyers are telling him what he wants to hear about the probe ending soon to prevent Trump from firing Mueller.

"There are many times he has expressed, I'm told by people in the White House, the desire to fire Mueller, the desire to pardon people under investigation including his family," Bernstein, a CNN contributor, told CNN's Dana Bash on "State of the Union." "His lawyers are telling him what he wants to hear -- that's what I'm told -- by lawyers in the White House, they're telling him what he wants to hear to keep him from acting precipitously and to go off and fire Mueller in a rage, or fire (Deputy Attorney General) Rod Rosenstein in a rage. They have an out-of-control client."

Bernstein added: "The President of the United States, in their view, is out of control most of the time, in their view, when it comes to this investigation."

Bernstein's partner of Watergate reporting fame, The Washington Posts' Bob Woodward, appeared alongside him on the program, telling Bash he expects Mueller to leave no stone unturned in the investigation.

"Mueller is going to do this job," Woodward said. "I think some of the Trump lawyers are fantasizing when they think it's going to be over quickly. There is no reason the Mueller operation is going to close up; they're going to want to be thorough."

Read MoreNEW YORK —-Senator Bernie Sanders and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are among the men most admired by Americans this year, according to a new poll, JTA reported.

A Gallup poll released Wednesday found that the Jewish Independent from Vermont and the Israeli leader placed seventh and ninth respectively in the list of most admired men, with one percent of Americans naming each of them as their first or second choice.

President Barack Obama, President Donald Trump and Pope Francis placed first, second and third, with 17, 14 and two percent respectively citing them as their first or second choice.

No Jewish women made the list top ten most admired women, although one percent of Americans named Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as their first or second choice. Less than 0.5% named Ivanka Trump, President Trump's Jewish daughter, their first or second choice. Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey topped the overall list for women.

The poll was based on telephone interviews with 1,049 adults ages 18 and over conducted between Dec. 4 and Dec. 11. It has a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.The present study used a novel experimental protocol to demonstrate that the production of an inner phoneme resulted in sensory attenuation of the auditory-evoked potential elicited by a simultaneously-presented audible phoneme, in the absence of any overt motor action. Crucially, the production of inner speech did not result in equal sensory attenuation to all sounds; sensory attenuation was dependent on the content of the inner phoneme matching the content of the audible phoneme. These results suggest that inner speech production is associated with a time-locked and content-specific internal forward model, similar to the one believed to operate in the production of overt speech (Hickok, 2012; Tourville and Guenther, 2011; Hickok and Poeppel, 2004; Houde et al., 2013). In short, the results of this study suggest that inner speech alone is able to elicit an efference copy and cause sensory attenuation of audible sounds.

The key finding of the present study was that the production of inner speech, by itself, led to N1-suppression to an audible sound. N1-suppression has been reported many times previously in response to overt speech (Ford et al., 2007a; Curio et al., 2000; Heinks-Maldonado et al., 2005; Oestreich et al., 2015; Houde et al., 2002). There is strong evidence that the mechanistic basis of N1-suppression to overt speech involves an efference-copy mediated IFM (Eliades and Wang, 2003; Crapse and Sommer, 2008; Rauschecker and Scott, 2009). It thus seems reasonable to assume that a similar mechanism underlies sensory attenuation in the case of inner speech. The idea that inner speech shares mechanistic features with overt speech is consistent with the conceptualization of inner speech 'as a kind of action' (Jones and Fernyhough, 2007, p.396) and, more generally, with Hughlings Jackson's belief that thinking is merely our most complex motor act: 'sensori-motor processes... form the anatomical strata of mental states' (Hughlings Jackson, 1958, p.49). In the words of Oppenheim and Dell (2010, p.1158), 'inner speech cannot be independent of the movements that a person would use to express it'.

It was notable that inner speech production resulted in N1-suppression if – and only if – the content of the inner phoneme matched the content of the audible phoneme; that is, only in the Match condition. That said, we note that comparisons between the Match/Mismatch conditions on the one hand, and the Passive condition on the other, should be treated with a degree of caution. This is because data for these conditions came from different trial blocks, and (most importantly) differed in terms of the task that participants were required to perform (i.e., produce a covert/overt phoneme at the precise sound-time, versus passively listen to the audible phoneme). Notwithstanding the fact that the N1-suppression effect has previously been found to be robust to variations in attention (Timm et al., 2013; Saupe et al., 2013) and trial structure (Baess et al., 2011), this nevertheless raises the possibility that differences in participants' attention or task-preparation may have contributed to the observed differences between the 'active' conditions and the passive condition. We note that this limitation is not restricted to the current study – it potentially applies to any procedure that attempts to measure sensory suppression by comparing active and passive conditions, which constitutes the vast majority of studies that have examined sensory suppression to overt speech. Critically, however, this limitation does not apply to the key contrast between the Match and Mismatch conditions. This is because data for these conditions came from the same trial blocks, in which participants were required to perform exactly the same task on each trial. For example, in blocks in which participants were required to produce the inner phoneme /ba/, they experienced both Match trials (in which the audible phoneme was /BA/) and Mismatch trials (in which the audible phoneme was /BI/), and there was no way for participants to predict whether the current trial would be a Match or Mismatch trial prior to the onset of the audible phoneme. Hence attention, task-preparation, etc., during the pre-stimulus period could not differ systematically between Match and Mismatch trials. Our factorial design also ensured that the differences between the Match and Mismatch conditions were not driven by differences in the inner phoneme (i.e., /ba/ vs /bi/) or differences in the audible phoneme (i.e., /BA/ vs /BI/). Consequently, we can conclude with confidence that the observed difference in N1 amplitude between Match and Mismatch trials reflects the impact of participants' inner speech on their sensory response to the audible phoneme. It is this contrast that demonstrates that inner speech, like overt speech, is associated with a precise, content-specific efference copy.

The results of the inner speech experiment mirror those of previous studies which have found sensory attenuation to overt speech to be reduced or eliminated if auditory feedback deviates from what would normally be expected; e.g., by pitch-shifting the feedback or providing foreign-language feedback (Heinks-Maldonado et al., 2006; Behroozmand and Larson, 2011; Behroozmand et al., 2011; Behroozmand et al., 2016; Larson and Robin, 2016). To confirm this pattern using the current procedure, we performed a supplementary experiment in which participants were required to overtly vocalize the phoneme at the sound-time. The key result from the overt speech experiment was that N1-amplitude elicited by an audible phoneme was significantly smaller when participants simultaneously produced the same phoneme in their overt speech (Match condition), compared to when they produced a different phoneme in their overt speech (Mismatch condition). This result, which is consistent with numerous previous studies in the sensory attenuation literature (Heinks-Maldonado et al., 2006; Behroozmand and Larson, 2011; Behroozmand et al., 2011; Behroozmand et al., 2016; Larson and Robin, 2016), was identical to the corresponding contrast in the inner speech experiment, in which participants had to produce phonemes in inner, as opposed to overt, speech.

A second notable finding of the overt speech experiment was that N1-amplitude was significantly smaller in the Passive condition compared to both active conditions (i.e., Match and Mismatch). A potential 'low-level' explanation for this result lies in the fact that participants were required to make an overt motor action in the overt speech experiment but not the inner speech experiment. While the marked difference in pre-stimulus activity between the active and passive conditions (Figure 5a) is consistent with this explanation, the fact that between-condition differences remained when correcting for the motor-associated activity (Figure 5b) stands against this possibility (though see Horváth, 2015; Sams et al., 2005 for a discussion of the challenges associated with motor correction when comparing active and passive conditions in studies of sensory attenuation). An alternative explanation for why N1 was smallest in the Passive condition is based on the idea that the auditory N1-component is (in addition to sound intensity, discussed previously) also sensitive to stimulus predictability, with predictable sounds evoking a smaller N1 than unpredictable sounds (Behroozmand and Larson, 2011; Bäss et al., 2008; Lange, 2011). Our task differed from other willed vocalization tasks in the literature in that the audible phoneme delivered to the headphones was: (a) of a different person's voice, and (b) much louder than the actual vocalization, as participants were instructed to vocalize quietly in order to minimize bone conduction. In other words, a substantial discrepancy between the predicted and actual sound existed, even in the Match condition. This sensory discrepancy was even larger in the Mismatch condition, as the content of the sound was also different. Consistent with the idea that N1-amplitude is sensitive to stimulus predictability, it is possible that the larger N1-amplitude in the active compared to the passive conditions was due to prediction-errors as to the expected quality of the audible phoneme. It is further possible that such detailed predictions as to phoneme quality do not occur in the context of inner speech (a suggestion for which there is some empirical support – Oppenheim and Dell, 2008), which may account for why N1-amplitude was not reduced in the passive condition in the inner speech experiment.

In summary, both the inner speech and overt speech experiments showed the same basic pattern of results with respect to the key contrast: N1-magnitude was smaller if the phoneme generated by the participant (either covertly or overtly) matched the audible phoneme than if it mismatched. These findings suggest that inner speech – like overt speech – is associated with a precise, content-specific efference copy, as opposed to a generic and non-specific prediction. Taken together, our results provide support for the contention that inner speech is a special case of overt speech, which does not have an associated motor act. The notion that inner speech generates an IFM in the absence of an overt motor act has been hypothesized previously across several different literatures (Jones and Fernyhough, 2007; Feinberg, 1978; Scott, 2013; Guenther and Hickok, 2015; Ford et al., 2001b; Sams et al., 2005; Kauramäki et al., 2010). However, this hypothesis has been notoriously difficult to test empirically, due to the covert nature of inner speech. Ford et al., (Ford and Mathalon, 2004) played participants repeated sentences over 30 s and asked them to reproduce the same sentences in inner speech. Ford et al., found that the sentences elicited a smaller N1-component when participants engaged in inner speech compared to when they did not, consistent with the results of the present study. More recently, Tian and Poeppel (Tian and Poeppel, 2010) used MEG to show that the auditory cortex was activated immediately following production of an inner phoneme in the absence of auditory feedback, which they took as evidence of an inner-speech-initiated efference copy. In a subsequent study, which was a strong influence on our own, Tian and Poeppel (Tian and Poeppel, 2013) asked participants to produce an inner phoneme within a 2.4 s window. This window was followed by an audible phoneme that could either match or mismatch the content of the inner phoneme. The authors found no difference in the amplitude of the M100 between the match and mismatch conditions, inconsistent with the results of the present study. However, given the width of the temporal window in which participants were asked to produce their inner phoneme (2.4 s), the efference copy and auditory feedback would not necessarily be expected to coincide under these conditions, in which case M100-suppression would not be expected to occur. Tian and Poeppel (Tian and Poeppel, 2015) asked participants to signal their production of an inner phoneme via a button-press, and measured the amplitude of the M100 component evoked by a pre-recorded audible phoneme of their own voice which matched the content of the inner phoneme, but which could be pitch-shifted or delayed. They found evidence of M100 suppression to unshifted, undelayed audible phonemes relative to a passive baseline condition, consistent with the results of the present study. Pitch-shifting or delaying the auditory phonemes was found to increase M100 amplitude above baseline levels. While this study's design enabled the timing of the inner phoneme to be precisely specified, the fact that it was specified by means of an overt motor action (i.e., a button-press), which is known to be associated with N1-suppression per se (Hughes et al., 2013), raises the possibility of the motor action and inner speech being confounded. Finally, Ylinen et al., (Ylinen et al., 2015) asked participants to mentally rehearse tri-syllabic pseudowords in inner speech. After several mental repetitions, an audible pseudoword was played which had either matching or mismatching beginnings and endings to the rehearsed pseudoword. The results revealed that audible syllables that were concordant with participants' inner speech elicited less MEG activity than discordant syllables, a result which is broadly consistent with the results of the present study.

The current experiment holds some methodological advantages over previous designs. Firstly, the experimental stimuli (animation, audible phonemes, rating-scale, etc.) were physically identical across all conditions, as was the nature of participants' task (i.e., to fixate on the screen and produce an inner phoneme at a designated time). The only thing that differed between the different trial-types was the inner phoneme that participants were asked to produce. This meant that the observed differences in sensory attenuation could not have been due to any physical differences between the conditions (Luck, 2005). Secondly, the fact that it was impossible to predict which of the two audible phonemes would be presented on any given trial meant that it was impossible to distinguish Match from Mismatch trials a priori. This meant that the observed results could not have been due to between-condition differences in, for example, demand characteristics. Thirdly, the 'ticker tape' feature of the current protocol enabled participants to very accurately time-lock the onset of their inner phoneme to match the onset of the external sound. In the current protocol, the position of the trigger line refreshed every 8.3 ms, which presumably enabled participants to time the onset of their inner phoneme far more accurately than would be possible with a countdown sequence, mental rehearsal or open temporal window, such as have been used in previous studies (Tian and Poeppel, 2013; Ford et al., 2001b; Ylinen et al., 2015). Finally, the current protocol did not require participants to make an active movement to signal the onset of their inner phoneme, such as by pressing a button. This is a significant advantage over previous studies which have employed a motor condition to signal the onset of covert actions, as it avoids the potential confound associated with having temporally-overlapping auditory-evoked and motor-evoked potentials – see Horvath (Horváth, 2015) and Neszmélyi and Horvath (Neszmélyi and Horváth, 2017) for a discussion of the challenges associated with 'correcting' for motor activity in studies of sensory attenuation. In light of its methodological features, the present study provides arguably the strongest evidence to date that inner speech results in sensory attenuation of the N1-component of the auditory-evoked potential, even in the absence of an overt motor response. Perhaps the most important strength of this paradigm is that all the above issues were controlled within a single task, thereby removing any reliance on cross-experimental inferences.

This study's focus on the N1 component is consistent with the majority of the existing literature on electrophysiological sensory attenuation. The rationale for focusing on N1 lies in the fact that the amplitude of this component is volume dependent; that is, other things being equal, loud sounds evoke N1-components of larger amplitude than do soft sounds (Näätänen and Picton, 1987; Hegerl and Juckel, 1993). In prior studies of N1-suppression, participants have typically generated sounds through overt actions such as overt speech, button-presses etc. The observation of N1-suppression in such studies thus implies that the brain processes self-generated sounds as though they were physically softer than identical external sounds. The N1-suppression demonstrated in the present study extends this idea by suggesting that the brain also processes imagined sounds as though they were physically softer than identical, unimagined sounds. In addition to providing evidence that inner speech is associated with an IFM of similar nature to overt speech, this finding provides evidence that mental state influences perception at a fundamental level (Gregory, 1997).

With regards to the question of what mechanism could underlie sensory attenuation to inner speech: a recent study by Niziolek, Nararajan and Houde (Niziolek et al., 2013) on sensory attenuation in the context of overt speech production found that the degree of sensory attenuation was stronger when participants produced vowel sounds that were closer (in terms of their acoustic properties) to their median production of these sounds, compared to when they produced vowel sounds that were, for them, less typical. These results suggests that the efference copy associated with overt speech production represents a sensory goal (i.e., 'a prototypical production at the center of a vowel's formant distribution', p. 16115), and that the distance (in formant space) of any given utterance from this 'sensory prototype' determines its degree of sensory attenuation. If inner speech is, in fact, a special case of overt speech (as we have suggested above), then this raises the question of the nature of the sensory goal in the context of inner speech production. One possibility, based on the results of Niziolek et al., is that in the present study (in 'imagine /ba/' trials, for example) the sensory goal was of a prototypical /ba/, which was presumably covertly 'spoken' in the participant's own voice (though see below for a discussion of the validity of this assumption). In this case, the participant's prototypical /ba/ would never match perfectly with the audible phoneme, as the audible phoneme would never be the participant's own voice.

The fact that the present study observed N1-suppression in the Match condition but not the Mismatch condition is nevertheless consistent with the Niziolek et al., 2013 account, in that the distance, in formant space, between an inner /ba/ and an audible /BA/ would be smaller than the distance between an inner /bi/ and an audible /BA/, even though the inner phoneme did not match the audible phoneme perfectly in either case (as the audible phoneme was always produced by the same unknown speaker). The fact that while Niziolek et al., 2013 observed maximal levels of sensory attenuation to prototypical vowel sounds, they still observed significant (i.e., non-zero) levels of sensory attenuation to atypical vowel sounds is also consistent with this idea. A prediction of this account is that participants should show even greater levels of sensory attenuation in the Match condition if the audible phoneme is presented in their own voice rather than the voice of an unknown stranger; testing this prediction may be a worthwhile endeavor in future studies.

In regards to the assumption that the sensory goals of inner speech are the same as overt speech, and that a person's inner voice is the same as their actual voice, there is some evidence in support of this conjecture: Filik and Barber (2011) provided evidence that people produce inner speech in the same regional accent as their overt speech. However, other studies have reported evidence suggesting that inner speech has impoverished acoustic properties relative to overt speech (Oppenheim and Dell, 2008). It is also possible that inner speech can consist of several distinct 'voices', with each having specific auditory properties; the fact that people with auditory-verbal hallucinations often report hearing multiple voices with different auditory properties (McCarthy-Jones et al., 2014) is consistent with this idea, if – as discussed further below – auditory-verbal hallucinations ultimately reflect inner speech being misperceived as overt speech. Finally, it is also possible that the acoustic properties of inner speech are not fixed. Specifically, in the context of the present study, it is possible that the acoustic properties of the audible phonemes began to influence the inner phonemes, such that after numerous repetitions, participants began to imagine themselves producing an inner phoneme with the acoustic properties of the audible phoneme. Testing these possibilities may also be worthwhile in future studies.

While the primary focus of the paper was on the N1-component of the auditory-evoked potential, between-condition differences were also observed in the amplitude of the P2 and P3 components (see Figures 3 and 4). A likely explanation for the observed results in these later components involves another ERP component, the N2, whose spatial and temporal distribution typically overlaps with that of the P2 (Griffiths et al., 2016). The N2 and P3 components are among the most heavily investigated components in the ERP literature (Näätänen and Picton, 1986; Polich, 2007), and are typically elicited by tasks – such as the auditory oddball and Go/NoGo tasks – in which the participant is asked to identify (by means of a button-press, for example) 'target' stimuli which are nested among 'non-target' stimuli (Smith et al., 2010; Spencer et al., 1999). Critically, the N2 and P3 can also be elicited by tasks in which a mental response is required, such as when target stimuli have to be mentally counted as opposed to signaled with a button-press (Mertens and Polich, 1997). We suggest that, in the two inner speech conditions of our study, participants made a mental response – possibly a 'template-matching response' along the lines of whether the audible phoneme matched their inner phoneme (Griffiths et al., 2016) – which they did not make in the Passive condition. In this case, the audible phoneme in the inner speech conditions might be expected to elicit an N2 and a P3 component, which would not be present in the Passive condition. The occurrence of a (negative-going) N2 in the inner speech condition would then interact and compete with the expression of a (positive-going) P2 component elicited by the audible phoneme. The result would be the absence of a distinct P2, but presence of a P3, in the inner speech conditions but not the Passive condition – as observed empirically. It is also worth noting that Tian and Poeppel (Tian and Poeppel, 2013) observed a larger M200 component in their match vs. mismatch comparison, consistent with the enhanced P2 observed in the Match vs. Mismatch comparison in the present study. Taken together, these results suggest that the M200/P2 component may index something other than a sensory prediction, possibly involving a cognitive 'template matching' process.

The implied existence of an efference copy to inner speech holds important implications for how to best understand some of the psychotic symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Some of the most characteristic of these symptoms seem to reflect the patient misattributing, to external agents, self-generated motor actions (e.g., delusions of control) and self-generated thoughts (e.g., delusions of thought insertion, auditory-verbal hallucinations – Feinberg, 1978; Frith, 1987). An influential account of these experiences argues that they arise because of an abnormality in the IFM associated with both physical and mental actions (Feinberg, 1978; Frith, 1992). This IFM abnormality leads to an inability to predict and suppress the consequences of self-generated actions, which leads to confusion as to their origins. This hypothesis has a strong theoretical foundation: for example, the distinctive symptom of thought echo, in which the patient hears their own thoughts spoken out loud by an external voice, can be well explained as the patient's own inner speech being misattributed and misperceived as an external voice (Frith, 1992). However, while numerous studies have provided empirical evidence showing that schizophrenia patients exhibit subnormal levels of sensory attenuation to their own physical actions (Whitford et al., 2011; Blakemore et al., 2000b; Shergill et al., 2005), including subnormal levels of N1-suppression to overt speech (Ford et al., 2001a; Ford et al., 2007b; Ford et al., 2001c), there is little empirical evidence that schizophrenia patients show sensory attenuation deficits to self-generated mental actions such as inner speech. Furthermore, the few studies that did report sensory attenuation deficits to inner speech in patients with schizophrenia did not include a 'mismatch' condition, raising the possibility that these sensory attenuation deficits ultimately reflect attentional deficits in the patient group (Ford and Mathalon, 2004; Ford et al., 2001d). We suggest that the failure to identify electrophysiological sensory attenuation deficits to inner speech in schizophrenia patients is not because the deficits do not exist, but rather because previous experimental protocols have been insufficiently sensitive to detect them. In order to maximize the chances of detecting sensory attenuation deficits to inner speech in schizophrenia patients, we suggest that future experiments should: (a) ensure that the onset of inner speech is precisely time-locked to the audible sound, without reverting to using a willed action (e.g., a button-press) to signal inner speech-onset, as this could potentially lead to the auditory and motor responses being confounded; (b) limit the content of inner speech to phonemes rather than entire sentences as this enables the onset and content of the inner speech to be more tightly controlled; (c) investigate patients exhibiting those symptoms that seem to most clearly reflect misperceived inner speech (e.g., thought echo, other auditory-verbal hallucinations), rather than grouping patients with different symptom profiles into a clinically-heterogeneous 'schizophrenia' group. By providing an optimized protocol for quantifying N1-suppression to inner speech, our hope is that the present study can provide a methodological framework for identifying and assessing sensory attenuation deficits in inner speech in patients with schizophrenia.

In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that engaging in inner speech resulted in sensory attenuation (specifically, N1-suppression) of the electroencephalographic activity evoked by an audible phoneme, but only if the content of inner speech matched the content of the audible phoneme. These results suggest that inner speech evokes an efference-copy-mediated IFM, which is both content-specific and time-locked to the onset of inner speech, which is consistent with the existing literature on sensory attenuation to overt speech. Cumulatively, this implies that inner speech may ultimately be 'a kind of action', and a special case of overt speech, as long suggested by prominent models of language. Accordingly, these findings not only provide insight into the nature of inner speech, but also provide an experimental framework for investigating sensory attenuation deficits in inner speech, such as have been proposed to underlie some psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.And hahaha, I know right? It's like, you know you want this. ;D

Thank you.The police were able to identify the suspect thanks to a photo on a flash drive.

The police was able to identify the suspect in the St. Petersburg Perekrestok bombing thanks to a flash drive found in a sausage at the crime scene, according to Fontanka.

The flash drive contained a bomb design and threats towards the Deir Center offering health and prosperity workshops, the publication reports. The police managed to discover what model of a smartphone was used to take the photo and then the owner of the phone.

It is worth mentioning that a flash drive with the same content was found in Deir. However, it was not specified how and when.

35-year-old St. Petersburg resident Dmitry Lukyanenko was arrested on suspicion of being involved with the bombing, according to earlier media reports. The arrestee is a drug addict and a member of the New Age occult movement, according to some reports. When questioned, Lukyanenko said he had attended Deir's workshops and decided to set off the bomb to protest what he was told there, according to Fontanka. The arrestee "was registered with a mental hospital and was asocial," TASS reports.

To recall, the bomb was detonated in the Perekrestok supermarket on the Kondratievsky Avenue on the evening of December 27. 18 people were wounded. The bomb was homemade and was equivalent to 200 grams of TNT, forensic specialists say. It was hidden in a storage locker.The unrest in Iran is just "the beginning of a big movement" that could be more widespread than the demonstrations of 2009, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer Shirin Ebadi said in an interview on Sunday.



"I think the protests are not going to end soon. It seems to me that we are witnessing the beginning of a big protest movement that can go well beyond the Green wave of 2009. It would not surprise me if it becomes something bigger," said Ebadi to the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.



A third night of unrest in Iran saw mass demonstrations across the country in which two people were killed, dozens arrested and public buildings attacked.



The demonstrations are the biggest since the Green Movement protests of 2009 against the re-election of the ultra-conservative ex-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, which were violently repressed.



But now the roots of anger are above all economic and social, according to Abadi, who now lives in exile in London.



"In Iran, and it is not new, there is a very serious economic crisis. The corruption in the whole country is at appalling levels. The end of certain sanctions related to the nuclear agreement with Europe and the United States in 2015 did not bring real benefits to the population, contrary to what many expected," the lawyer said.



"Added to this is the fact that Iran has very high military expenditures. People are not willing to see so much money spent on it," she added.



"Young people are the most disappointed," Ebadi said, referring to the high unemployment, corruption and "the climate of censorship".



"The economic situation and the frightening gap between the rich and the poor, between those who enjoy well-being and those who cannot, are at the root of the protest," the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize-winner said.

================================================================Trumpwashing—defined as whitewashing, obscuring or rewriting the broader US record by presenting Donald Trump as an aberration (FAIR.org, 6/3/16)—was on full display Thursday in a nominally straight news report from the New York Times' Mark Landler (12/28/17) on how Trump has reshaped US foreign policy. Buried in the otherwise banal analysis was this gem of US imperial agitprop:

Above all, Mr. Trump has transformed the world's view of the United States from a reliable anchor of the liberal, rules-based international order into something more inward-looking and unpredictable. That is a seminal change from the role the country has played for 70 years, under presidents from both parties, and it has lasting implications for how other countries chart their futures.

There's lots of ideology to unpack here, but let's start with the empirically false assertion that the "world" viewed the United States as a "reliable anchor of the liberal, rules-based international order." Poll (Guardian, 6/15/06) after poll (Pew, 3/14/07) after poll (PRI, 1/3/14) throughout the years has shown that much of the world views the United States as threat to peace, often taking the top spot as the single greatest threat. What evidence Landler has for the world viewing the US as a sort of good-natured global babysitter is unclear, as he cites nothing to support this hugely important claim (since if Trump's cynical disregard for "human rights" is nothing new, then there's no real story here). It's just thrown out with the assumption the Times readership is sufficiently nationalistic and/or amnesiac to either not notice or not care. It's designed to flatter, not to elucidate.

The second dubious assertion is the idea that the US is "viewed" as being (or, by implication, objectively is) concerned with "liberal, rules-based international order." Perhaps Landler missed the part where the US runs offshore penal colonies for untried political prisoners, and a decade-long drone war that's killed thousands—both entirely outside the scope of international law. Or the time the US invaded and destroyed Iraq without any international authorization, killing hundreds of thousands. Or perhaps he missed the part where the United States refuses to sign "liberal, rules-based international order" treaties such as the International Criminal Court or the ban on bombs and or a prohibition on nuclear weapons. Or the part where the US not only doesn't recognize the International Criminal Court, but has a law on its books (dubbed "the Hague Invasion Act," passed in 2002) that if an American is ever held by the ICC for committing war crimes, the US is obligated to literally invade the Hague and free them.

And this is just in the past 15 years. Landler, even more laughably, starts the clock in 1947, which would include dozens of non-"liberal," non-"rules-based" coups, invasions, bombing campaigns, assassinations, extrajudicial murders and so forth. The number of actions carried out by the US not sanctioned by even the thinnest pretext of "international order" is too long to list.

What exactly is this "liberal, rules-based international order," and when did "the world" view the United States as its most reliable anchor? Landler doesn't say, he simply asserts this highly contestable and ideological claim, and moves on to pearl-clutch about Trump ruining the US's hard-won moral authority. He has some 100 percent uncut pro-US ideology to push under the guise of criticizing Trump, and no amount of basic historical facts will get in his way.

"Turysta wpadł w szał, ubliżał strażnikom i prowokował do bójki, ponad 300 osób walczyło o wejście do sań" - relacjonuje "Tygodnik Podhalański".

Zdjęcie Turyści w drodze do Morskiego Oka /Grzegorz Momot /PAP

Do awantury doszło na Polanie Włosienica, gdzie docierają konne zaprzęgi z turystami udającymi się nad Morskie Oko.

Reklama

Jak relacjonuje "Tygodnik Podhalański", około godz. 13 na zjazd do Palenicy Białczańskiej czekało 300 osób w wieku od 19 do 35 lat. Kolejka sięgała aż do schroniska. Większość osób piła piwo albo wino.



Turyści zostali uprzedzeni wcześniej przez pracowników Tatrzańskiego Parku Narodowego, że ostatni zjazd odbędzie się o godz. 17. Na informację, że nie wszyscy zmieszczą się do sań, oczekujący zareagowali awanturą.



Gdy jeden z turystów został poinformowany, że ani on, ani jego żona z dzieckiem, nie znaleźli się w grupie wliczonej do zjazdu, wpadł w szał.



"Proponował strażnikom łapówkę, aby tylko go zwieźli z rodziną samochodem służbowym. Gdy strażnicy odmówili, zaczął ubliżać strażnikom, znieważał ich i prowokował do bójki" - relacjonuje "Tygodnik Podhalański".McFeels and Halberstram return from Christmas break to bring you the latest on the goings on of the past week, beginning with the year-in-review of 2017. It has been a red letter year indeed. Then, a look ahead with our very own FTN SWOT analysis for 2018 and onto things heating up with immigration and the steady collapse of the Russian collusion narrative. From Democrat malaise and more cucks dropping like flies from the national stage, to the many missteps of Team Bannon as they break the cardinal rule of politics to never cuck. It's all ahead on Fash the Nation!

A message from Natsume president and CEO Hiro Maekawa:

Happy New Year to our Worldwide Fans! The year 2017 was a very special and memorable year for us. It was the 20th Anniversary of our Harvest Moon franchise. Taking this opportunity, I would like to share my unforgettable memory about the birth of Harvest Moon with all our loyal Harvest Moon fans. It was 1996 when I first came across an unknown farming simulation game for the SNES. I played the game, and found it very unique and heartwarming, something I had never seen before. My instinct told me that this niche game might have great potential to grow in America, given that America is a large farming country. At the same time, I felt a sense of nostalgia about the game, since I was born and spent my childhood in the countryside of Japan. At that time, I was a newcomer to the video game industry, and I did not know much about the U.S. video game market. So, I decided to check with my associates in the industry to see what they thought about this game. To my shock, all the comments I got were extremely negative! Basically, they said that the game was very boring, there was no excitement, and there would be no market for this type of bland game in the U.S. All the negative comments were understandable in hindsight due to the fact there was no such video game genre as "Farming Simulations" at that time. However, it was my strong intuition that this non-violent, family-oriented game could have a big potential to resonate with fans in this country. Based on this belief, I decided to release, this game and named it Harvest Moon. And this is how Harvest Moon was born twenty years ago! In celebration of Harvest Moon's 20th Anniversary, we have developed a new Harvest Moon title, Harvest Moon: Light of Hope. It is the first Harvest Moon title to be multi-platform, as it is for PC (Steam), Nintendo Switch, and Sony PlayStation 4. The PC version of Harvest Moon: Light of Hope was released for Steam in November, and we are very happy with its sales performance thus far. Harvest Moon: Light of Hope for the Switch and PS4 are scheduled to be released early this year, both physical and download. Thanks to the continued support by loyal Harvest Moon fans worldwide, this once-unknown farming simulation game has grown to be one of the best-known family-oriented franchises for gamers of all ages! We sincerely appreciate all those loyal fans for their continued support. We have several other exciting titles coming this year in addition to Harvest Moon: Light of Hope for Switch and PlayStation 4, so please stay tuned! Our company mission for the past 23 years has always been, and will continue to be, to "Make Everyone Happy" with exciting, interactive entertainment software for the entire family. At Natsume, "Everyone" means all of our customers, Natsume employees, and all of the people we work with, such as our development partners, our distribution partner, retailers, financial institutions, media, and all of the people who are directly or indirectly connected with Natsume and our products. We at Natsume are committed to continuing our corporate mission to "Make Everyone Happy," and we would appreciate your continued support. Wishing "Everyone" a very happy, healthy, and wonderful New Year! Sincerely,

Hiro Maekawa

A letter from Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda:

I would like to wish everyone a Happy New Year. The environment surrounding the content industry is undergoing significant changes as advancements are made simultaneously in multiple technologies, including AI, xR (VR, AR, MR), next-generation communications systems, and payment infrastructure. As a result of these advances, consumers are likely to enjoy richer content experiences and greater convenience. These environmental changes look poised to gather further momentum going forward, and we expect them to serve as a tailwind for our Group. As such, we will forge ahead with our content development efforts and accelerate the expansion of our global content business. Disruptive technological evolution gains speed In 2017, AI garnered considerable attention globally for its far-reaching disruptive potential, and advancements were made in the commercialization and uptake of xR (VR, AR, MR) technologies. With the Olympic and Paralympic Games set to be held in Tokyo in 2020, Japan is preparing to ramp up its 5G infrastructure build-out. In the near future, this effort should result in mobile networks that provide constant connectivity and support massive data traffic at a low cost. Since HTML5 already enables web browsers to display high-quality 3D on par with native apps, browsers may garner renewed attention as a gaming platform once 5G networks are in place. The expanded application of fintech is also capable of putting emerging market payment infrastructure on par with that of advanced nations in short order. Payment infrastructure is as vital to digital content businesses as is communications infrastructure, so its rapid development should serve as a significant tailwind to the geographic expansion of our Group's businesses. As these examples illustrate, technological advancements result in new forums for creating content and in new business opportunities. For this reason, they are a major enabler for content producers in their efforts to provide their customers with new experiences. We look for such advancements to gain even further momentum in 2018 and beyond. A richer lineup of digital content platforms Another key feature of the current digital content landscape is the smartphone. Annual global smartphone shipments are now in excess of 1.5 billion units1, making the smartphone an essential device for the enjoyment of digital contents, and the evolution of smartphone technology knows no bounds. In the consumer game console space, March 2017 saw the release of the Nintendo Switch, which has proven a major global success, selling more than 10 million units worldwide. PlayStation 4 has also seen sales of more than 70 million units, and the Xbox One series, which has just added the Xbox One X to its lineup, got off to a good start during the holiday season. These successes present major business opportunities to game publishers and developers. 2017 was also a year in which Japanese game titles represented a significant presence on the global consumer console game market. While the consumer console game market has been solid in the West over the past several years, it has struggled in Japan. However, we expect the Japanese market to gain significant vitality going forward as it joins the overall trend. New amazement and fun for our customers everywhere In 2017, our Group saw results from our ongoing strategy of portfolio expansion as we were able to generate numerous hits with major and mid-sized titles in entertainment content markets around the world. In 2018, we will leverage the aforementioned global acceleration in technological evolution as well as prevailing market trends in order to provide high-quality, highly creative contents so that we can bring new amazement and fun to our customers the world over. We thank you for your continued support in the new year. Yosuke Matsuda

Xenoblade Chronicles 2Here it is, GIMP 2.9.8 has been released some days ago now, the latest development version of GIMP! As it is customary now, let's list our involvement in this version so that our supporters on crowdfunding platforms know what they funded. 🙂

Since it also happens to be the end of the year, I complete this post with our end-of-year report, as we also did in 2016.

What we did for GIMP 2.9.8!

During this release span, I focused most of my efforts on bug fixing. I finished a few features here and there but actually even restrained myself from coding too many new stuff! Why? Because I believe we have enough and at some point, we should just release GIMP 2.10. Of course, GIMP 2.10 could be even twice as awesome if we push it by a few more months, and 5 times more awesome with even more time. But then in the end, if you never see it, what's the point, right? Actually I even plan on just doing this (bug fix and finishing what was started) until we get 2.10 out. Let's stop feature craziness!

Apart from a lot of bug fixes, I did a lot of bug triaging these last months (looks like I participated in 122 bug reports between 2.9.6 and 2.9.8, i.e. 3 and a half months). And this month, I also reorganized our bug tracker still for the same reason (pushing GIMP 2.10 release forward) by reviewing the 50+ bugs we had in the GIMP 2.10 milestone to set as blockers only the ones we should really look into. Right now that's down to 25 such bugs!

I also put some efforts in our stable flatpak release, which is how since October 16, GIMP has officially had its flatpak package on flathub! It is of course visible on the GNU/Linux section of GIMP's download page with a nice "Install GIMP flatpak" orange button (notice also the cool drawing on this page? That's Aryeom's!).

Right now, you can only install the stable release, i.e. GIMP 2.8.x (flathub only accepts stable builds) but if you get it there, when GIMP 2.10 will be out, you will automatically get an official update!

In any case, this flatpak thing (in particular keeping our development flatpak manifest up-to-date with git code and testing the builds) is taking a lot of maintenance time!

As a whole that was 122 commits authored by me in GIMP repository between GIMP 2.9.6 and 2.9.8, out of 474 commits (so ~25%), and I pushed a few more commit from third-party when I reviewed them...

We also had again 2 guest commits by Lionel N., board member of LILA association, the non-profit managing ZeMarmot project.

Of course, though I said I focused on bug fixes, there are still a bunch of cool features I participed to during this release:

Support of password-protected PDF for import (the 2-commit feature implemented by Lionel from LILA !) and new procedure `file-pdf-load2()` API for plug-ins and scripts to open password-protected PDF files, but also multi-page PDFs (loading a multi-page PDF was already possible through the GUI but not by scripts and plug-ins).

!) and new procedure `file-pdf-load2()` API for plug-ins and scripts to open password-protected PDF files, but also multi-page PDFs (loading a multi-page PDF was already possible through the GUI but not by scripts and plug-ins). Help system improvements: upon detection of locally installed manuals in several languages, GIMP will now allow selection of the preferred manual language in the Preferences dialog (Interface > Help System). I felt this was an important feature because we regularly had people not understanding why the manual they installed was not seen by GIMP. And they were right, especially since we don't have as many manual languages as GUI languages. For example, we have 3 Chinese translations (zh_CN|TW|HK) but only a zh_CN manual. I could definitely imagine someone with a zh_HK GUI to go for the zh_CN manual as a fallback.

I could definitely imagine someone with a zh_HK GUI to go for the zh_CN manual as a fallback. Verbose version (command line: gimp -v) now displays C compiler information (useful for debugging).

Canvas rotation and flipping information are now visible in the status bar, and this information is interactive (clicking the flip icons will unflip the canvas; clicking the rotation angle opens the "Select Rotation Angle" dialog). Some people were indeed noting that with the ability to flip/rotate the canvas, in some cases, you may end up "lost" on whether it is currently rotated, flipped or whatnot. After all, the status bar already has zoom information and flip/rotation is quite a similar feature. 🙂

Screenshot implementation for KDE/Wayland.

Color picker implementation for KDE/Wayland.

Improve delay handling for screenshots.

Review HGT support patches and improve a bunch of stuff with auto-detection of the format variants (SRTM-1 and SRTM-3), and also a `file-hgt-load()` API for scripts and plug-ins.

But really, as I said, I think my bug fixes and maintenance of previous code was actually much more important than this above list, even though it is so less fancy (and I am a bit sad I cannot list bug fixes in a non-boring way!). And I will just focus more and more on fixes and stability to get GIMP 2.10 out as soon as possible.

ZeMarmot in 2017: our report!

You know it, ZeMarmot is not only about GIMP, even though this software is a huge part of it! ZeMarmot is about making an animation film in 2D drawing, traditional animation yet with digital means (i.e. drawing on computer, not paper). We draw with GIMP. Well Aryeom Han, animator and animation film director does so (not me). And we crowdfund this project.

Financial status

This year was a bit tough mentally and we really started to wonder if this project was a good idea for our lives. Project finances increased continuously yet very slowly, and were still extra low all throughout 2017 (under 400 € a month).

In October, I finally shouted a cry for help after my computer broke, and we are so happy that many people heard it! The funding increased by about twice.

Now let's be clear! Our current funding is more or less 1000€ since October. This is a lot better than what we had before and it gave us a lot of hope. Yet it still does not pay full time salaries for 2 people (faaar from it, actually it cannot even pay a single full time salary obviously). So we still hope you will not forget us and if you appreciate our project and what we do, both on GIMP development and/or on ZeMarmot movie, please we will be very thankful if you can donate to the project.

ZeMarmot project donations can happen on:

Live Streaming while GIMPing

We were conscious that the lack of news on the animation side was not the best. On the other hand, animation just takes time. That's the way it is.

Depending on the complexity and details of the animation (as chosen by the team), a minute of animation can take a month of work or more (just search the web, all links say the same).

Of course, it depends on your artistic choices. If you do vector animation or Limited Animation (Simpsons or the likes), you can animate a lot faster. Basically you don't take the same time to animate South Park or a Disney movie (which is not a problem, it's a choice; I appreciate The Simpsons or South Park too). For ZeMarmot, as you know, we chose a detailed style with full traditional animation. At times we regretted this choice a bit but that's the way things are.

That's how Aryeom decided to live stream herself working! She took a few days to search software and found the Free Software OBS, understand how things work (well she also managed to break Fedora once by reinstalling NVidia drivers while following tutorials! :p), made many tests throughout December and since December 25, public livestreams started.

The work is regularly live-streamed at this address:

» https://www.youtube.com/c/LibreArtInfo/live «

Unfortunately we have not found the right organization yet to plan and give a schedule of future livestreams. So for the time being, the best is either to follow us on Twitter, subscribe to the Youtube channel, or just try to have a regular look at above link.

Previous livestreams are recorded and listed automatically on the channel once the streaming ends, so you can also have a look later on older (not live anymore) streaming. Be aware though: this is real live of someone working really. That means it is real time, not accelerated 20 times (as all these speed painting you can see everywhere), errors may happen and are not edited out afterwards. There is no sound and Aryeom doesn't interact with people. She is focused and doesn't look at what is streamed (we will sometimes look at the chat though and may answer questions but don't consider it as a granted "feature"; this is a peek at an animator work, not a service). The artist sometimes goes for a rest, and so on. It can even be boring at times. Also the longer recorded streaming in the list is more than 7 hours straight! Fair warning. 😉

Still I think that's an awesome experiment and we already had some very cool comments, like people thanking us (some in English, many in French) because that it is a bit like being allowed to sneak into an animation studio to observe the animators working.

Art+Code symbiosis

We regularly have the question: "why don't you have separate crowdfundings for development and animation sides?"

Answer: because this project is a whole. It is symbiotic: I do Free Software because I use it; if I didn't have ZeMarmot (or another project where we use GIMP), then I would likely not contribute to GIMP. It is that simple. Aryeom as well would likely not use GIMP if she didn't have a developer by her side.

We remind that is how I started my first patches: because we had crashes and many issues with GIMP and this was not enough for us as a professional tool at the time. We are very happy to tell you that now, it is. Not only because of us, far from it, let's be clear! We are so happy to hack together on GIMP with several very talented developers (among them, Mitch, GIMP maintainer who is still here after 20 years!). But we were allowed to do our part and this is the reason we stuck around.

To illustrate, just a few hours ago, thanks to Aryeom's streaming of her work, we were able to have an unexpected live demo of how well we work together. During her live, GIMP crashed! Ouch! In a few minutes, she was able to find reproduction steps during the live streaming. Less than two hours later, I fixed the crash then improved my fix in the master repository of GIMP (it actually took even just a few minutes to reproduce and fix the crash, but well I also had other priorities which I could not drop immediately!).

That's how well we work together and what you pay for when you donate to ZeMarmot project, and finally that's the reason why it is a 2-people project, not 2 separate projects. 🙂

So if you ever hold your donation because you only want to pay for a movie, or at the opposite only want to pay for GIMP development, I hope you will review your judgment and see why you get to your goal even better by paying for both!

GIMP Motion

GIMP Motion is our plug-in for animation in GIMP (we talked about it earlier for simple then complex animations). You can also see it in action in Aryeom's live streamings by the way, nearly daily now.

Unfortunately I have kind of neglected it lately, and that's mostly for the reason I told earlier: because I am really focusing on getting core GIMP 2.10 out. So I hope this won't just drag forever (seriously I want to get done with GIMP 2 and go forward with GIMP 3!)

That means that GIMP Motion will likely not be a part of GIMP 2.10. Yet it will be a part of a further GIMP 2.10.x release since we decided earlier that we would relax the no-feature policy on minor releases, which is how I decided that GIMP Motion was not ready to be part of a stable release. That's exactly why I pushed for this no-feature policy relax for years (ever since 2014, cf. the section "GIMP Meeting(s)" on our LGM 2014 report!): so that we don't have to rush half-done features nor push important releases forever.

Well we still use it internally, but that's still very very rough and has many bugs. Be warned if you try it!

Documentating the process of animation

This year, we have been a bit light on documenting the process. Well we had a post on animatics, key-framing, etc. and one on background design. We also had a few talks during the NUMOK festival in Paris, as well as in the JM2L meeting in South of France where we could give some interesting details on the process as well which are not written here yet (but should be soon).

I am the first to admit that's not enough since Aryeom and I really want to document the techniques behind giving life to still images. But as I said, we had been a bit down, overworked and penniless this year so this fell a little behind. Hopefully we'll do better next year.

ZeMarmot in the news

This was also cool since, we got on local TVs twice this year thanks to JM2L! In all the videos, GIMP is clearly mentioned and shown on screen as well as Aryeom hacking animations on GIMP in GNOME. 🙂

We have been featured on France 3 (also in writing):

Then on PleinSud TV (at 2:32):

And a mention in a newspaper, Nice Matin:

New material

Thanks to the increased funding at end of year, we were able to renew a bit our material. In particular we bought a Wacom MobileStudio Pro (basically a laptop-tablet from Wacom) on which the first thing we did was to erase Windows and install a GNU/Linux (Fedora 27) and GIMP. And that worked well. We still opened more than a dozen of bug reports here and there, so don't expect things to be perfect yet. But we are working on it!

We documented a bit our process on a Twitter moment and unfortunately had to take a pause because of hardware issues. We indeed had to send the tablet back to after-service, which gave it back after more than 3 weeks (2 days ago)!

Now we will have to start it all again. Be prepared, we might publish a very complete guide soon on how to get a very cool Wacom laptop with Linux and GIMP. 🙂

Conclusion

This year was hard but eventful, and the end of year gave us more hope after funding increased and we were able to upgrade our material.

The streaming of Aryeom GIMPing was also a very cool idea and we are happy to see that people seem to like it. To this day we only got positive feedbacks. We should have started this sooner!

We do hope that things will continue to improve. We love what we do and our project, and we really wish we will soon be able to say proudly that we are able to make a living by hacking Free Software and Libre Art.

When this day will come, this will just be a very very happy day. 🙂

Happy New Year 2018 everyone!For a long time, infidelity was seen as a man's game, a cliché story line of married business men hooking up with their secretaries. But the landscape for cheating in the last few decades has changed and experts say women are cheating just as much as men.

In her new book State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity, author and psychotherapist Esther Perel said since the 1990s, the rate of married women who have cheated has increased by 40 per cent, CNN notes. The rates among men, however, have not changed.

Ceilidhe Wynn, a matchmaker for Friend of a Friend Matchmaking and relationship expert based in Ottawa, says it's not only that women are cheating more, but a lot more of them are talking about it as well.

"Women have the same opportunities [to cheat], but we are still told not to be sexual people and cheating is seen as a sexual act," she tells Global News, adding at the same time, women are more open about the reasons they cheat on their spouses.

Being able to work in a larger social network with all kinds of people has also made cheating more accessible, says Dr. Jessica O'Reilly, host of the @SexWithDrJess Podcast.

An increase in income is also important — women don't have to rely on their husbands if the relationship does go sour. "We do have some data suggesting that higher income earners are more likely to cheat," O'Reilly says.

The pleasure in an affair

Violet (who has decided to only share her first name) of Ontario was married for 13 years before she joined Ashley Madison in 2010, a dating site for people seeking others who are married or in relationships.

The site, whose parent company settled in a data breach lawsuit earlier this year, is free for women. In Canada, the ratio of women to men is three active females for every one paid active male, the company confirmed with Global News.

"It was the secret," she says. "It was something that was mine and I didn't have to share it with anyone else." Tweet This

The 47-year-old stay-at-home mom says she was in a happy marriage. She was raising two young children, her husband worked towards his career and she never felt neglected at home. But after 13 years of her routine life, it became stagnant.

"I began to feel unsexy and I heard about the site and thought to take a look... I didn't expect to meet somebody who fit my criteria."

That year she met a married man she fell in love with and things quickly became addictive. He was an educated professional father who was in a similar situation as she was. The relationship lasted on-and-off for seven years and Violet's current husband still has no idea.

"It was intense ... for three years," she says. "We were seeing each other multiple times a week, talking on the phone, emailing, sending texts ... he was my primary go-to, he was more my husband than my husband was." Tweet This

After the three years, he ended up leaving his own wife, but Violet chose to stay with her husband and kids. While her affair has recently dissolved, she went back on the dating site three months ago. So far, she hasn't met anyone like him.

"I think I am looking to replace what I had."

Nobody knows Violet's secret and she doesn't ever plan on telling her husband.

"There's a stigma attached to cheating," she says. "I would hate for my children to know their mother did this. I can say my husband is a very good man, but everyone's story is individual.

"Once you choose to step outside of your marriage, it's very hard not to go back. There's something you miss, over years of marriage, attention and physical as well, but in an affair, you can explore different things."

Claire, 45, of Toronto had a similar stale marriage. Coming from a sexless one, she joined Ashley Madison in 2006 and ended up meeting her current partner.

The two are now both divorced, live together and have been in an open relationship for the last three years. "[This way] we can both experience other people ... we missed out on a lot when we were married."

Her partner is currently on the site, while she sees another man on her own time. They both have each other's passwords (but she says they haven't logged in) and have ongoing conversations about the people they chat with.

When she first cheated on her now ex-husband, she says it was about the sex, but it also showed her how awful her home life and marriage were.

"You have no idea what's going on behind closed doors in another marriage," she says. "Nobody else knew what my marriage was like when I cheated."

Socially acceptable to cheat

But no matter how many more people are doing it or how easy it is to find single (and married) people to cheat with, O'Reilly says it's still not socially acceptable to cheat — and never will be.

"I do think its acceptance is still gendered with women being judged more harshly," she says, adding the younger generation, however, is a lot more open to a broader range of relationships.

"They seem to understand that monogamy is a choice and that they can custom-design their relationships according to their needs," she says. "They're looking for reasonable solutions that meet mutually agreed upon practical, emotional and sexual needs.

"I believe that cheating rates will decline in the upcoming decade as couples realize that monogamy is not an imperative, but one of many arrangements into which you can opt in or opt out. " Tweet This

But cheating is still a dirty word, Wynn adds, and although she doesn't condone it, she understands what drives people to do it.

"You have needs that aren't being met and we're all selfish creatures," she says. "At the end, I don't think there's anything wrong with [cheating] if we're looking for fulfillment. It doesn't make us bad people."

The fine line between being a "good" and "bad" person is always on Violet's mind, and although she says she would feel betrayed if her husband had cheated on her (she also agrees it is hypocritical), she doesn't necessarily think she's a bad person.

"I don't feel like either of the men I was involved with were bad people either," she says. "Everybody's situation is individual. I don't feel bad, I don't feel guilty ... it's this bubble and nothing from the outside can affect us. It's just you and that person."Send this page to someone via email

Colombia has shipped around 50 tonnes (55 tons) of ham to Venezuela after protests broke out over shortages of the traditional holiday staple, an official said Saturday.

The first two trucks of ham arrived in Venezuela on Friday night, a source from Colombia's national tax and customs office told AFP.

On Saturday, there were "two other trucks ready to go," but awaiting final procedural approval, the source added, without specifying the amount of ham in that shipment.

The transport ministry said it had issued a firm a "special permit" to transport the ham to Barinas, western Venezuela.

Hundreds of Venezuelans took to the streets this week to protest that they had not received ham promised by the government as part of a subsidized food program.

A Colorado deputy sheriff died Sunday afternoon following a shooting at an apartment on New Year's Eve.

Zachary Parrish, 29, was rendered unconscious by the shooting and didn't survive his injuries, Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said.

Four other officers by the names of Mike Doyle, 28, Taylor Davis, 30, Jeff Pelle 32 and Tom O'Donnell, 41, were injured along with two civilians. O'Donnell is an officer with Castle Rock Police while the other three deputies were with Douglas County. All the officers who survived are in stable condition and both civilians suffered non-life-threatening injuries.

The situation began around 5:15 a.m. local time when police responded to a domestic disturbance on the 3400 block of County Line Road. Once the officers arrived, Spurlock said they were met with gunfire. The suspect fired over 100 rounds during the engagement, Spurlock continued.

In a press conference, Spurlock told reporters that the suspect is believed to be dead. While police believe the suspect was known to them, they did not release their name.

While the sheriff didn't know the order in which the officers were shot, he did know "that all of them were shot very, very quickly and they all went down within seconds of each other."

He added that the suspect's weapon was a rifle, but didn't reveal more details.

Spurlock went on to explain how after the officers were shot down, Parrish was unconscious while the others were able to crawl despite their injuries. After the other officers had cleared the immediate area, the suspect continued shooting at the officers over Parrish.

By the time Parrish was rescued, "he had no ability to survive the injuries and the locations that he was his," Spurlock said a physician confirmed.

Parrish is survived by his wife and two young children.

A spokesperson for the sheriff's office told the New York Times that a SWAT team was also present at the scene.

Spurlock also confirmed that the officers had been called to the same apartment earlier because of a noise complaint, but couldn't find any evidence that there were any issues, and left.

Two males lived in the apartment where the shooting took place.

Depois de uma passagem como técnico no Morumbi que durou 37 jogos em apenas seis meses, ele agora se habitua a realidade de comandar uma equipe da série B. No papo com Casagrande para o Esporte Espetacular, o ex-goleiro explicou com detalhes sua saída do São Paulo, disse que deixou o clube sem mágoa e julga não ter sido usado politicamente pela diretoria. Ele fala também de seus planos para o Fortaleza, conta que tem ajudado na montagem do elenco, opinado na melhoria do CT do clube e que está feliz por ver suas opiniões bem aceitas nos diferentes setores do clube cearense. (clique no vídeo e veja a entrevista completa)

No quadro Casão FC, o comentarista Walter Casagrande recebe uma personalidade do esporte para um papo franco e com Rogério Ceni não foi diferente. O técnico que deixou o São Paulo com 49,5% de aproveitamento, sendo 37 jogos, 14 vitórias, 13 empates e dez derrotas analisou sua passagem no tricolor paulista em detalhes, passando pela primeira conversa com Leco e a chegada ao clube após a saída de Ricardo Gomes. Ceni julga que começou no lugar certo, mas lamentou ter perdido jogadores velozes e de qualidade que tinha no elenco, citando David Neres, Araújo, Lyanco, Maicon e Thiago Mendes. Ceni falou também sobre seu sistema preferido e as primeiras dificuldades que teve como técnico.

- Como eu comecei com o São Paulo na Florida Cup. Tendo os jogadores para este sistema eu gosto de pressão alta, jogadores de velocidade, primeiro volante que possa entrar entre os zagueiros e liberar bem os alas. No começo do meu trabalho minha dificuldade maior foi desenvolver treinamentos, Michael Beale me ajudou muito com isso, somando também a influência dos 24 ou 25 treinadores com quem trabalhei ao longo da carreira.

Ao fazer um resumo de seu primeiro trabalho como treinador, Ceni não demonstra mágoa com o jeito com que foi demitido, diz que não se sentiu usado pela diretoria e afirma que dificilmente seria treinador no Corinthians ou no Palmeiras.

- Não me decepcionei com a demissão. Lógico que eu fico triste por ter sido mandado embora do clube que eu defendi. Fiz de tudo por este clube. Mas também entendo que a profissão de treinador ela é sujeita a essas coisas. Eu não me senti usado politicamente pela diretoria do clube. Se usou, eu desconheço, mas não me senti usado em momento nenhum e estou sendo super sincero. Acho muito difícil eu treinar Palmeiras ou Corinthians. Mesmo para frente, a história está escrita de uma maneira tão bacana. E também acho que ninguém lá nesses clubes ia querer me contratar, imagina eu entrando no CT deles. Eu tenho muito carinho pelo São Paulo, independente do que tenha acontecido – explica ele.

FORTALEZA

Aos 44 anos, o paranaense de Pato Branco segue tricolor. Só que agora além do branco e do vermelho, ele substituiu o preto pelo azul no comando do Fortaleza. Ele conta como o clube da capital cearense o seduziu, e afirma que está participando da formação do elenco do Leão e que está feliz com a boa recepção de suas opiniões nos diferentes setores do clube.

- Tinha em evento para fazer em Fortaleza e o pessoal do clube me ligou. Aí liguei para o Bosco e ele confirmou. Fui conversar com o pessoal do Fortaleza. Fiquei indeciso, vivi meus últimos 27 anos em São Paulo, fiquei na dúvida. Fui conhecer o CT do clube. Depois o presidente me ligou e eu pedi mais um tempo. Aí o presidente veio a São Paulo e eu coloquei as coisas que precisavam melhorar no CT. Mas para mim é um grande desafio, fui e estou feliz em ir para Fortaleza. O que é diferente em um clube como o Fortaleza é eles gostam que você dê sua opinião em outros setores como o marketing, parte estrutural, nas contratações. Uma coisa que eu fiz foi participar da formação do restante do elenco dentro das possibilidades do orçamento do clube. Já olhei mais de 150 jogadores, estou em contato diário com eles. Todos os departamentos e funcionários do Fortaleza estão querendo ouvir minha opinião.

Fora da Copa do Brasil e da Copa do Nordeste, Ceni vai focar suas baterias no estadual e na preparação para a competitiva Série B do Brasileirão. Só que o técnico tem se deparado com um orçamento bem mais enxuto do que estava acostumado no São Paulo.

- Só temos dois campeonatos. O cearense até abril, o Fortaleza não classificou para a Copa do Brasil nem para a Copa do Nordeste, e em seguida a série B do Brasileiro. Eu espero conseguir montar um time, que ainda não consegui até esse momento. A concorrência do mercado é muito grande, tem muitos clubes nesta faixa salarial, nesse nível da Série B é tudo muito parecido. Com exceção do Goiás por exemplo, que tem um poder aquisitivo maior e que levou por exemplo o Rafinha, do Brasil de Pelotas, ou o Giovani, do Náutico. Indiquei 20 jogadores e o presidente está trabalhando – encerra ele.Let's see...what did I draw thorough the year of 2017...

Anyway, HAPPY NEW YEAR IN ADVANCE EVERYONE!

I wanna take this opportunity to thank all of you for liking/enjoying my works and for accompanying me thorough 2017. I know I'm not exactly active online and sometimes even slow on updates, but I thank you for being patience with me while I juggle between tasks.

*RequiredRússia: Veja os detalhes sobre a regulamentação das criptomoedas e ICOs

Por Guia do Bitcoin Postado em dezembro 31, 2017

O quadro regulatório das criptomoedas e oferta inicial de moedas (ICOs) da Rússia está pronta. Foi desenvolvido em conjunto com o Banco central do país e o Ministério das Finanças. Os governantes compartilharam alguns detalhes do projeto, incluindo como a atividade de mineração deve ser tributada.

O Ministério das Finanças e o Banco central da Rússia apresentaram o quadro de regulamentação das criptomoedas e ICOs na reunião do Ministério Público na última quinta-feira. O projeto de lei deverá ser adotado em março de 2018.

A vice presidente do banco central, Olga Skorobogatova, disse que o banco "Não considerará as criptomoedas como um meio de pagamento. O ministério das finanças propôs definir a criptomoeda como "outra propriedade".

O ministro das Finanças, Alexei Moiseev, explicou que, com base nessa definição, "você pode comprar uma criptomoeda e trocá-la por outras propriedades", incluindo tokens.

Sem suporte para cryptoruble

Sobre a criptomoeda nacional, a cryptoruble, "tanto o ministério das finanças quanto o Banco central avaliam negativamente as perspectivas de criação e lançamento de uma criptomoeda nacional".

Regulando as ICOs

O quadro regulatório libera a captação de investimentos através das ICOs, mas estabelece restrições sobre elas. Os investidores que não atenderem os requisitos do quadro regulatório apenas "poderão comprar tokens, num limite máximo de 50 mil rublos (~ USD $ 869)". O ministério também sugeriu limitar "o montante máximo arrecadado por uma ICO a 1 bilhão de rublos (~ $ 17,4 milhões)".

Quanto aos limites das ICOs, o presidente da Associação Russa de Criptomoedas e Blockchain (RABIC), Yuri Pripachkin, argumentou que a obtenção de fundos para as ICOs não deve ser limitada, pois pode "atrair uma quantidade ilimitada de investimentos estrangeiros para os projetos".

Imposto sobre mineração

O projeto de lei apresentado na quinta-feira explica a definição de mineração e como será tributada, de acordo com a notícia. O ministro das finanças disse a repórteres que empresários e entidades jurídicas poderiam se envolver em atividades de mineração. Ele explicou que a legislação tributária atual será aplicada e o Serviço de Impostos Federais decidirá se haverá um limite para a tributação da mineração.

Feed RSS: http://guiadobitcoin.com.br/feed/Passwords are a bane of modern life. They never seem to end. If you use the same password for everything (not recommended), you run the risk of hacks and identity fraud. Too many passwords, you are liable to forget one at the wrong moment. As our digital life expands into more platforms, apps, and devices, things are almost at a breaking point. How many passwords do you have? How many forgotten? Enough is enough.

Breaking passwords is an ancient art, dating back centuries. Spies and kings of centuries past relied on passwords and code-breaking to carry out their duties. Many historians credit the Allied effort to crack the Enigma device as a key factor in the outcome of WWII. Mathematicians, "script-kiddies," and criminals alike enjoy the rewards from breaking new passwords to peer into places they shouldn't go. In the modern world, our entire global economy (and our intimate personal life) relies on a delicate balance between accessibility and security.

Recently, breaking passwords made an impact on everyday consumers of the world's biggest brands. Sony, Apple, Yahoo, Adobe, Equifax — the list goes on and on. Even the popular password manager app LastPass suffered a hack — a virtual treasure trove for identity fraud artists. Hackers uncovered email addresses, passwords, authentication hashes and password hints for millions of users. If you want to feel sick to your stomach, read this list of major data breaches maintained by Wikipedia. Can you find yourself on the list?

In a year of hacks with victims in the hundreds of millions, it's time to talk tough about online security. As the pace of online commerce and communication increases, the world needs a better solution. A few young startups have embraced the blockchain as a potential cure to "password-itis" and a safer internet for everyone. Centralized architecture is a liability when one hack allows access to all of the data stored away safely behind a single wall.

It's not just personal photos and messages at risk. Critical infrastructure such as power plants, traffic lights, and financial markets rely on passwords to keep out nefarious elements looking to do harm. Online identity fraud costs society billions of dollars every year, and we all pick up the tab for the insured losses. In a connected world, criminals from around the globe are lurking at every turn. We all become all victims eventually.

Phishing, server breaching, and password cracking all rely on a point of attack. Faking credentials is your ticket to entry. Online security is an elaborate game played by security professionals and hackers, one side trying to stay ahead of the other. Two-factor authentication was a beneficial recent development, but it relies on continuous uninterrupted access to a second device in most cases. A decentralized authentication protocol, similar to the blockchain behind cryptocurrencies, might just change the rules of the game for good.

Companies like REMME use the blockchain to protect everything from critical infrastructure, the Internet of Things, medical devices, financial information, and payment platforms. Decentralized ledgers are much harder to fake as opposed to a single resource. It's much easier to forge a diary than a best-seller with millions of copies available for public reference.

In the case of REMME, a specific SSL certificate lies within the blockchain to authenticate each user. The data itself is encrypted and safe from prying eyes, but the fidelity of the record-keeping is impossible to disrupt using decentralized authentication. The days may be numbered for password servers, eight-character minimums, and "please use one of the following: capitals, lowercase, numbers, special characters."

Strong security protocols and user-friendliness are typically polar opposites. Given the freedom, most users choose "12345" or "password" for their online accounts. Developers solved the problem with draconian rules for passwords and behind-the-scenes tactics such as hashing and salting. Now, we live in a dystopian world, relying on human memory for our security and failing to stop major hacks on private information every year. The blockchain is already a major disrupting force in the banking and financial world. Online security is an obvious next step for a better, safer internet for everyone.

As more and more of the world's commercial activity moves onto the web, the demand for trusted communication and reliable payment architecture will grow. Passwords aren't the only problem, but they are a major impediment to speed, convenience, and security. Even if everyone on Earth could memorize a thousand passwords with a hundred characters each with flawless ease, the problem won't go away. We all need a better solution, and we may find it in the blockchain.

# Alpha Casper FFG Testnet Instructions Welcome to the first release of the alpha Casper FFG testnet, built on pyethereum. This network represents the result of years of work on cryptoeconomic proof-of-stake and months of active development of the client, and is a fully-featured and usable network, allowing users to send transactions, mine and become validators. However, this is still several steps away from a network that will be ready for launch. Some parameters are set differently from the intended final settings, and the currently only available client, pyethereum, has a much lower processing capacity than clients implemented in faster languages; as a result, network parameters will be heavily restricted to ensure network sustainability. **Do not expect performance equivalent to test networks operated by more performant clients such as Geth and Parity**. ### What is Casper FFG and how does it work? This is out of scope of this document, but you can find info in these links: * [Proof of stake FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ) * [Casper FFG paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09437) * [Presentation by Karl Floersch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycF0WFHY5kc) * [Jon Choi's Casper 101](https://medium.com/@jonchoi/ethereum-casper-101-7a851a4f1eb0) The rest of this document assumes some familiarity with Casper FFG. ### Just taking a look If you want to go straight to running a node, feel free to skip straight to the next section ("Running a Node") Look at the ethstats page here: [http://34.203.42.208:3000/](http://34.203.42.208:3000/) Also, you can use web3 (installation: `sudo pip3 install web3`) to connect to a node as follows (assuming python 3): ```python > from web3 import Web3, HTTPProvider > web3 = Web3(HTTPProvider('http://52.87.179.32:8545')) > web3.eth.getBlock('latest') # This should return the head of the chain ``` Then: ```python > import urllib.request, json > # This may take a while depending on your internet connection > casper_abi = json.load(urllib.request.urlopen( "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vbuterin/868a6213b058fb4f1fdfcf64e54f0e91/raw/33fc177da3863ec320d1ebf95816ba52ffbffbe8/casper_abi")) > casper = web3.eth.contract(abi=casper_abi, address='0xbd832b0cd3291c39ef67691858f35c71dfb3bf21').call() # This should return the current epoch > casper.get_current_epoch() ``` Look through [the Casper contract](https://github.com/ethereum/casper/blob/master/casper/contracts/simple_casper.v.py) to see all the functions that you can call. Any public variable has a corresponding getter method, eg. a variable `x`, if it's public, has the corresponding getter `get_x()`; see the Vyper documentation [here](https://github.com/ethereum/vyper/tree/master/docs) (the latest available info) or [here](http://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (this is outdated as of April 2 2018) for a more complete description on what getters are available. ### Running a node To run a node, follow the following instructions to download and run a Docker instance: Installing docker (if you do not yet have it) on Ubuntu: ```bash curl -fsSL get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh sudo sh get-docker.sh sudo usermod -aG docker $USER ``` (Replace $USER with your username, i.e. the one you see in login, in the terminal, in your file directory, etc.) Make sure to log out and log back in after this step. On MacOS, follow the instructions here: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#install-and-run-docker-for-mac Getting the docker containers for the testnet nodes (warning, this involves a few hundred MB of downloading) ```bash $ git clone http://github.com/karlfloersch/docker-pyeth-dev $ cd docker-pyeth-dev $ sudo make new-account 🌟 Creating keystore directory at ./validator/data/config/keystore 🌟 Enter a new password to encrypt your account: 🌟 Your password is stored at ./validator/data/config/password.txt 🌟 Pyethapp container is creating new address for you, might take few seconds: ``` Running: ```bash $ sudo make run-node bootstrap_node=enode://d3260a710a752b926bb3328ebe29bfb568e4fb3b4c7ff59450738661113fb21f5efbdf42904c706a9f152275890840345a5bc990745919eeb2dfc2c481d778ee@54.167.247.63:30303 ``` If that enode does not work, try replacing with: `enode://a120401858c93f0be73ae7765930174689cad026df332f7e06a047ead917cee193e9210e899c3143cce55dd991493227ecea15de42aa05b9b730d2189e19b567@52.87.179.32:30303` Also, if you have a Geth, Parity or Akasha client or other service already using the port 30303, try changing it to something else, e.g. 30304. If you are running a node, then you can use web3.py to connect to it: ```bash $ docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 20a0dfe1d9e2 casper-validator "sh /root/start.sh p..." 18 minutes ago Up 18 minutes 8545/tcp, 30303/tcp, 30303/udp validator $ docker exec -it 20a0dfe1d9e2 python ``` Replace `20a0dfe1d9e2` with whatever container ID appears in the output when you run `docker ps`. Then repeat the web3 instructions above inside the python console that appears, but use `Web3(HTTPProvider('http://localhost:8545'))` in place of the remote node. To mine: ```bash $ sudo make run-node mine_percent=90 bootstrap_node=enode://d3260a710a752b926bb3328ebe29bfb568e4fb3b4c7ff59450738661113fb21f5efbdf42904c706a9f152275890840345a5bc990745919eeb2dfc2c481d778ee@54.167.247.63:30303 ``` If you get an error like this: ``` docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/validator" is already in use... ``` Then, you can fix by running `sudo docker rm validator`. ### Running a validator First, you will need to have enough testnet ETH to become a validator. You can either mine a lot of blocks, or ask us for ETH (a faucet may be available soon). To ask for ETH, you will need to have an ETH address. You can either use a keystore file you already generated on your own, e.g. using geth or pyeth_keys, or generate one with the docker tools. To login as a validator with the account you generated by running the `sudo make new-account` command above, run: ``` make run-node validate=true deposit=2000 bootstrap_node=enode://d3260a710a752b926bb3328ebe29bfb568e4fb3b4c7ff59450738661113fb21f5efbdf42904c706a9f152275890840345a5bc990745919eeb2dfc2c481d778ee@54.167.247.63:30303 ``` Replacing 2000 with whatever amount of ETH you want to deposit (min 1500). From there, just leave the docker node running. Note that once you log on, it will take ~1.5 dynasties (normally, ~30 minutes) until you are in the active validator set and can start voting. ### Checking your status Aside from the web3 route, you can also play around with the node directly through the python console. Press Ctrl+C inside of it, and you will see an instruction like `Hit [ENTER], to launch console; [Ctrl+C] again to quit! [0s]`. Press Ctrl+C again and you will enter the console. From there, you can use `eth.chain` to access the pyethereum Chain object (see documentation [here](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum)). Use `eth.services.accounts.accounts[0].address` to get your validator's address, which is also used as a kind of ID for the validator. You can also create a python object that will let you call commands of the Casper contract as so: ```python >> import urllib.request, json >> casper_abi = casper_abi = json.load(urllib.request.urlopen( "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vbuterin/868a6213b058fb4f1fdfcf64e54f0e91/raw/33fc177da3863ec320d1ebf95816ba52ffbffbe8/casper_abi")) >> from ethereum.tools import tester >> casper = tester.ABIContract(tester.State(eth.chain.state), casper_abi, '0xbd832b0cd3291c39ef67691858f35c71dfb3bf21') >> casper.get_current_epoch() # This should return the current epoch number ``` To get data about yourself, do: ```python >> my_index = casper.get_validator_indexes(eth.services.accounts.accounts[0].address) >> # This should return your current deposit size >> casper.get_deposit_size(my_index) >> # This should return the current dynasty, and your validator's start and end dynasty >> casper.get_dynasty(), casper.get_validators__start_dynasty(my_index), casper.get_validators__end_dynasty(my_index) ``` Note that you will need to re-run the `casper = tester.ABIContract...` line in order to call Casper with the most recent state. To broadcast a transaction, use `eth.app.services.chain.broadcast_transaction(tx)` To exit pyethapp, type Ctrl+D. ### Logging out You can log out with the command: ``` make run-node validate=true logout=true bootstrap_node=enode://d3260a710a752b926bb3328ebe29bfb568e4fb3b4c7ff59450738661113fb21f5efbdf42904c706a9f152275890840345a5bc990745919eeb2dfc2c481d778ee@54.167.247.63:30303 ``` Then just leave the validator running, and after the withdrawal period ends it will automatically send another transaction to withdraw you. Note that in general, staying online is important. You as a validator will only be profitable if you are online more than half the time in the normal case, and if many other validators are offline than you may need to be online almost all of the time in order not to incur a loss.Washington D.C.—

An early preview of the 2020 Census includes a controversial question listed at the end of the Census questionnaire form.

The question is listed as follows:

Do you agree President Donald Trump has the biggest hands in presidential history? (Check one)

Yes ◻

I don't know ◻

Census Director Tom Yieldman's office has issued a statement that the US Census is not entirely drafted yet, and that nothing will be final for some months still.

Numerous studies show how men and women are treated differently at work, and how these differences affect behavior. This roundup of research articles, six in total, explores why women don't apply for roles if they've been previously rejected; what wearing sensors in the office reveals about gender bias; how marriage impacts women's careers (and vice versa); how VCs talk about male and female entrepreneurs differently; and why women choke less than men (at least when it comes to tennis).

We publish a lot of articles based on new research (you may have noticed). This year, some of our most viewed and shared stories were based on studies about women — and, more specifically, stories looking at differences in how men and women are treated, and behave, at work. I've summarized six below, including one where the office is actually a tennis court.

The question: Why do fewer women end up in senior positions than men? Is it because they have fewer mentors? Less face time with managers? Or aren't as proactive as men in talking to senior leaders?

The methodology: An analysis of email communication and meeting schedule data for hundreds of employees in one office over four months. One hundred employees were given sociometrist budgets (similar to the ID badges worn by all employees) to track in-person behavior, including movement, proximity to other badges, and volume and tone of speech.

The results: No perceptible differences were observed in the behavior of men and women. They had the same number of contacts, spent the same amount of time with senior leaders, and allocated their time similarly. They also spend the same amount of time in online and face-to-face conversations. Yet women weren't advancing and men were.

The conclusion: "Our analysis suggests that the difference in promotion rates between men and women in this company was due not to their behavior but to how they were treated. This indicates that arguments about changing women's behavior — to 'lean-in,' for example — might miss the bigger picture: Gender inequality is due to bias, not differences in behavior." –Stephen Turban (former data scientist, Humanyze), Laura Freeman (data analyst, Humanyze), and Ben Waber (Humanyze CEO, visiting scientist at the MIT Media Lab)

The question: Are actions that lead to professional success viewed less favorably in the heterosexual marriage market?

The methodology: Career center questionnaires were completed by 355 incoming business school students (241 men and 114 women) regarding their job preferences (desired compensation, hours of work, and days per month of travel). Students also rated their leadership abilities and professional ambition.

The results: When single women were told their answers would be viewed by just their career counselors, single and married women gave similar answers. When they were told their answers would be viewed by both counselors and peers, however, single women lowered their desired salary (from $131,000 to $113,000 on average) and the number of days they were willing to travel (14 days vs. 7). The hours they were willing to work per week dropped by four, and they also reported less professional ambition.

The conclusion: "Taken together, our results suggest that single women avoid actions that would help their careers because of marriage considerations, and that marriage considerations may be an additional explanation for gender differences in the labor market. Many schooling and initial career decisions...occur early in life, when most women are single. These decisions can have labor market consequences with long-lasting effects." –Leonardo Bursztyn (University of Chicago), Thomas Fujiwara (Princeton University, and Amanda Pallais (Harvard University)

The question: The initial aim of the research was to help financial decision makers develop better processes. But as the data was collected and analyzed, a more gendered pattern began to emerge.

The methodology: Observations of closed-room, face-to-face discussions of final funding decisions among Swedish government VCs. In total, 125 applications (99 from male entrepreneurs and 26 from female entrepreneurs) were discussed between 2009 to 2010.

The results: The VCs' rhetoric often reflected stereotypical ideas about women having qualities opposite to those considered important to being an entrepreneur, with VCs questioning their credibility, trustworthiness, experience, and knowledge. When they spoke with men, the VCs' language borrowed from stereotypical beliefs about entrepreneurial potential.

Women were also only given 25% of the applied-for amount; men received an average of 52% of what they asked for. Women were also denied financing 53% of the time, while men's applications were dismissed 38% of the time.

The conclusion: "Broadly, our research suggests that stereotyping through language underpins the image of a man as a true entrepreneur while undermining the image of a woman as the same. Such stereotyping will inevitably influence the distribution of financing, but could also have other major consequences. Because the purpose of government venture capital is to use tax money to stimulate growth and value creation for society as a whole, gender bias presents the risk that the money isn't being invested in businesses that have the highest potential." –Malin Malmstrom (Luleå University of Technology), Jeaneth Johansson (Halmstad University and Luleå University of Technology), Joakim Wincent (Luleå University of Technology and Hanken School of Economics)

The question: It's known as the "Oscar curse": women who are awarded Best Actress are more likely to file for divorce than men awarded Best Actor. Do women's high-status careers affect marital stability?

The methodology: A total of 209 women in executive leadership roles completed a 9-item scale survey about their status relative to their husbands. Data was also collected from 53 of their husbands.

The results: Women who felt they were in a higher status position compared to their husbands were more likely to have feelings of resentfulness or embarrassment, which negatively impacted their marital satisfaction (note: men were unaffected by their wives' feelings and were only dissatisfied with their marriage if they felt their wives were outwardly dissatisfied about it). However, when husbands provided material (and not just emotional) support to their wives (helping with child or elder care, household chores), women did not report feeling resentment.

The conclusion: It's still challenging for women to achieve both a successful career and a family, and open dialogue between spouses can help. But perhaps more importantly, tangible support (from both husbands and, potentially, organizations) can make it easier. –Alyson Byrne (Memorial University of Newfoundland) and Julian Barling (Smith School of Business, Queen's University)

The question: Why do women, who begin their careers with ambitions as high as their male peers, stop competing for top jobs?

The methodology: A study of more than 10,000 senior executives in the U.K. who were competing for top jobs, interviews with top women leaders, a survey, and a randomized experiment.

The results: Women were less likely than men to apply for a job, but only if they had been rejected for a similar job before. Why? Not because they lacked confidence, but because they felt they wouldn't be truly valued at the highest levels of the corporate world. In addition, women also perceived recruitment and hiring processes as less fair.

The conclusion: "Women's decisions to remove themselves from competition after having been rejected is driven partly by their experience of being a negatively stereotyped minority in the executive labor market. Think about it — women executives were coming to the table with past experiences of being in the minority, and they may have been in situations in which they felt like outsiders or felt that their leadership ability wasn't recognized. Because the majority of men had generally not been subject to these same situations, men were less likely to take rejection as a signal that they did not belong in the corner offices, and therefore such disappointments had less of a negative impact on their willingness to apply again." –Raina Brands (London Business School) and Isabel Fernandez-Mateo (London Business School)

The question: Who chokes more when it matters: men or women?

The methodology: An analysis of more than 8,200 tennis matches from 2010 Grand Slam tournaments, specifically focusing on server performance in the first set played.

The results: Men's performances deteriorated at critical junctures (in sets that went to 4-4, for example), while women's remained the same in pre- and post-tie situations. And when women's performance did go downhill, it was 50% less of a drop, on average, than the drop seen for men.

The conclusion: "We can confidently say that in the world of elite tennis, women are better under pressure than men are. They choke less. Whether that translates to other competitive settings remains to be seen." –Alex Krumer (University of St. Gallen)

By Kvarki1 CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons

One of my larger goals for 2018 is to free myself from the claws of facebook. My facebook usage patterns are pretty bad at this point. I don't have a facebook app on my phone, but still I spent way more time on the website than I am comfortable to admit. Now that I have a family, I need to value my time more. It's totally unacceptable to spent 3h surfing the web and procrastinating at night, and to wake up unfit for my parenting duties in the morning.

Being a not very self controlled individual, taking away distractions is the best way for me to take control over my life. For the same reason I have abandoned TVs for a long time, and keep my phone in flight-mode for most of the day (sorry guys 😉). I feel that facebook is a major distraction for me at this point. I have to free myself from it's influence if I want to stay mentally fit, and healthy.

The time has come to say good-bye to the big blue "f".

In this post I share the details of my plans, in the hope that they might be beneficial to others. Also it serves as a visible public reminder, if I were to fall back to using it again.

Step 1: Realize that Facebook is harming me (and you)

There are many, well established ways, in which facebook is harming individuals and the society as a whole:

This is only the tip of the ice-berg, you will be able to find a lot more abusive behavior if you read the news, or Google for "facebook addiction" or "filter bubble", etc.

Step 2: Reflection - What am I using facebook for?

From the top of my head I can think of the following things I use facebook for on a regular basis:

Newsfeed Browsing. Just keep scrolling, read stuff shared by friends and the inserted ads, click on like and share buttons. Political Discussions. I regularly engage in political discussions on facebook. I try to speak up against discrimination and prejudice from all sides. Occasionally I write up comments or opinions on political events. Brag about sports, looks, wealth, etc. This is particularly important if you are looking for a partner. I have done less so recently, but I certainly feel the urge to share photos of me having (what looks like) an awesome vacation or driving shiny cars, etc. Promote my own concerts, blogs, talks etc. Contact list. It holds a database of 765 people I have met in the last 8 years. I use it to look up names and photos, or see who is living in a city I will be traveling to. Messaging. I sometimes use facebook to contact people, when I don't have an email address.

Step 3: Decide: Ditch or Migrate

When quitting facebook, I will no longer be able to perform the above activities with my account. So I will have to either ditch those activities or find alternative tools for doing them.

Newsfeed Browsing -> Ditch!

This is precisely what I want to get away from. This means that I will know less about what a large number of people I know and like are doing. There is no way around this. I will have to focus more on a circle of close friends and people that live in my area. Political Discussions -> Ditch!

There is a case to be made, that engaging with Trumpists or AfD voters in Germany is just feeding the trolls. Facebook is a not a good place for those discussions at all. The proper way to do politics is maybe to join a local party, and limit myself to things I can do in my community. I will continue to write comments about politics, either on my blog or as "Leserbrief" to a newspaper. Bragging -> Ditch!

There is no loss in me not sharing poser photos, or athletic achievements (not that there have been any notable ones). Promotions -> Migrate

This is an important aspect for me and something I don't want to loose. If I write a post like this one, I want my friends to know about it and be able to comment and share it along. Contact List -> Migrate

Managing contacts is really important. I need to keep track of whom I have met, and how to contact them. Ideally this includes pictures, and further information like date of birth, names of spouse and children, etc. Messaging -> Ditch!

I have not used messaging features much in any case. Usually the only thing I have asked in chat is: "Can I have your email, please?" Avoiding facebook chat is going to be easy for me.

In the next section, I will discuss which migration paths I see, and how I intend to follow through with them.

Migration Plan: Self promotion via Email Newsfeed

Self promotion, for me, is writing about stuff that I do or like. This has many benefits, but primarily important is to make people aware of it.

My professional profile is maintained on Twitter @heinrichhartman. This is not going to change. I have used twitter to connect with peers in IT, and hence my feed is much less political and gossipy than my facebook stream. I hope I can get away with this, without it becoming a substitute drug.

For more personal content, like concerts, blog posts, private events, etc. I plan to use email. One thing that I plan to do is create a mailing list, with people I usually reach on facebook these days. This list will contain a small set of close friends I am in regular contact with. In addition I will give everyone of my facebook friends the possibility to join if they so desire.

This list will be low volume (less than one post per week) and contain some material I would otherwise post online. It will include:

Pointers to blog posts I have written

Personal events that I'd like to share

Interesting reads

I realize that email is much more heavy weight than facebook posts, or tweets. There won't be one-liner emails like "This is awesome: [link]" every day.

It's not that facebook is a particularly good contact manager. But it certainly holds a great database, with well maintained entries (you are updating your profile).

It's possible to extract a list of friends with names from facebook (facebook.com/help). A name however, is very little information: No pictures, no email, no address, no date of birth. There was a time where this worked where you could get your friends email addresses from facebook if you had a Yahoo email account. This is no longer the case and it has become increasingly cumbersome to get something out.

I hope that I will be able to save all current profile pictures as well, not sure I will succeed. At the very least I can get a print out of the friends list, that includes pictures and names.

Maintaining a list of friends myself will be more work since I have to do all of it. This also means this list will be smaller.

I have not yet found a good solution for this problem. I have tried Google Contacts and fullcontact.com for a while. They are OK, but not great for various reasons. Maybe I will just roll with (structured) plain text, or Spreadsheets. Maybe even a paper solution like Rolodex (Ger: "Rollkartei"). I will let you know, if I find something that works well for me.

Update 2018-01-02: If you want to follow this blog you can already subscribe to the newsletter.

Migration Plan: Exporting your profile data

Facebook allows bulk download of your profile data here.

The resulting zip file is easy to work with. You will get a stripped down offline HTML version of your facebook page, where you can see your posts, photos, comments, etc. in a familiar form.

This dump can be stored and allows you to look up stuff that you said or shared on facebook.

However, don't kid yourself. The data loss is real:

You will loose access to all content your friends shared.

You will not be able to export basic profile information like email addresses from your friends profiles

That's the price you pay when adopting a tool with a heavy vendor lock-in.

Practical Considerations

Actually deleting your data is pretty straight forward. Just go to

https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account

and fill in the form.

Facebook allows for a two week period before your profile is actually deleted. For details of what gets deleted see e.g. StackOverflow 2013.

Before taking this step I'll have to post my contact information, communicate my plans about the email news feed and make sure I have contact information of all my close friends available.

Wish me luck!

So it has finally happend! I pulled the trigger.

Figure 1: Quitting Facebook. For real. [PNG]

Actually it I did not actively use facebook for since I wrote this post. I made no more interactions on the site. But I admit, that I still checked in once or twice a day, just to close the tab after a few seconds.

But what took me so long?

It turns out that the exported facebook data is much worse than I realized at first. In particular the exported timeline is very incomplete!

All comments are missing. Even the ones you wrote yourself!

There are no images in the timeline.

The number of likes and shares is missing.

Before I delete my account, I wanted to have a more decent backup of my timeline. I looked into printing out the timeline, exporting it as pdf, full-page screenshots, massaging the DOM/HTML. I could get none of this working, with acceptable effort.

Eventually I went throught the whole timeline (100s of posts!) and screenshotted each one individually. To make this process a little less tedious I changed the OSX keyboard shortcut for full page scrrenshot to F1, so I could use the following combo:

j – navigate to next post in page

– navigate to next post in page F1 – take a screenshot

In this way I could complete the task in less than one hour. But now I have all posts archived in a large folder, so I don't loose that much data. It's still terrible in many ways, but acceptable for me.

Find out what other deviants think - about anything at all.A respeito da polêmica desencadeada pela entrevista do presidente do PSOL Marcelo Freixo à Folha, as disputas entre PT e PSOL se devem exclusivamente à busca de espaços políticos de lado a lado.

O PT sempre foi uma confederação de tendências. Aliás, o PT dos anos 80 seria o melhor exemplo de partido contemporâneo, nesses tempos de redes sociais, de coletivos e outras formas horizontais de organização.

A própria caminhada rumo ao poder, no entanto, induziu a uma centralização do poder em poucos grupos majoritários. Houve um acordo político que permitiu dividir poder, excluindo não apenas a esquerda mais radical, mas outros grupos minoritários.

No período José Dirceu a centralização se justificava, até como forma de garantir a governabilidade de Lula. No poder, como seria natural, o PT se estratificou. A era Ruy Falcão, serviu apenas para consolidação de poder interno, sem a mínima capacidade de enxergar o entorno. E tudo isso, enfrentando o período de maiores transformações na história da militância política, com o advento das redes sociais e das novas formas de organização.

E aí é importante entender adequadamente os movimentos de junho de 2013. Está certo Lula de enxergar a mão externa. E está certo o presidente do PSOL, Marcelo Freixo, de enxergar os novos tempos.

As manifestações de 2013

Quem deu o tiro inicial foi um coletivo de esquerda, o Movimento do Passe Livre, em cima de uma bandeira relevante, mas pequena em relação ao conjunto de políticas públicas.

Acendeu o fósforo no momento em que o mal-estar econômico se alastrava por todo o país, em um movimento pendular que se seguiu à grande euforia do período 2008 a 2012. Às ruas foram jovens militantes de esquerda, classe média desiludida, o grupo dos que posteriormente passaram a ser conhecidos como "coxinhas".

Mas quem apanhou da Polícia Militar de Alckmin foram os jovens esquerdistas, não os halterofilista do MBL. Mesmo assim, o PT fechou completamente as portas a eles. Temia perder o protagonismo das ruas.

Nesse sentido, Marcelo Freixo está coberto de razão.

O novo tempo era dos coletivos, das mobilizações virtuais. Nem o PT nem Dilma Roussef se deram conta dos novos tempos.

Poucos meses antes das manifestações, tive um encontro com a presidente Dilma Rousseff, presente Helena Chagas – ambas poderão atestar o conteúdo da conversa. Nele, alertei a presidente que, nas redes sociais, havia uma militância de esquerda aguerrida mas que estava acuada pela militância de direita que surgia. E a principal razão era a falta de bandeiras políticas legitimadoras.

– Você não dá bandeiras a eles, disse-lhe.

Era simples para a direita mobilizar as pessoas em torno do mal-estar. Bastava mirar a figura maior, a presidente da República. Foi assim nas diretas, na qual o presidente era um militar. Para os grupos que defendiam a presidente, o jogo era mais difícil. Tinha que levantar bandeiras, defender princípios.

Naquele período, a única bandeira legitimadora foi a do Mais Médicos. Depois, nenhuma mais.

Na fase de maior politização da história, tinha-se no poder paradoxalmente um governo de esquerda e o mais tecnocrático da história em período democrático e uma direção partidária mais preocupada em defender o território interno conquistado do que em conquistar novos adeptos.

O PT jogou os jovens do MPL ao mar e perdeu o único ponto de contato com as ruas.

E aí foi uma baba (para usar um termo mineiro) para a direita, especialmente com o know how acumulado pela consultoria norte-americana nas sucessivas primaveras em países do Oriente Médio.

Em um novo mercado político, no qual até os motoqueiros conseguiam arregimentar pessoas para manifestações políticas, bastou bancar dois ou três grupos organizados para incendiar as redes sociais e esparramar-se pelas ruas. Especialmente depois que, a partir do terceiro ou quarto dia, a Globo o descobriu que havia um terreno fertilíssimo para seus intentos golpistas.

Portanto, ambos – Lula e Freixo tem razão. O PT nunca entendeu os movimentos que surgiam das redes sociais. Não entendendo, deixou a porta escancarada para o trabalho da direita e de seus consultores externos.

Os conflitos de esquerda

Os partidos políticos brasileiros não são democráticos. O PSDB é dominado por caciques. Mesmo com suas prévias, não existe democracia interna no PT. E, por tal, entenda-se o modelo capaz de permitir a existência de grupos minoritários que tenham espaço para disputar o poder.

Um mapa nacional do PT mostrará a consolidação de lideranças tradicionais em todos os quadrantes do país, mais no sudoeste sustentado pela malha sindical, mais ao norte por lideranças formadas há mais de duas décadas. A última leva de dirigentes nasceu da campanha do impeachment, de 25 anos atrás. A maior parte dos dirigentes, das diretas de 30 anos atrás.

Um partido democrático abriria espaço para a oposição interna, grupos que combateriam a direção sem sair do partido, desde que houvesse horizonte de alternativa de poder. É o grande segredo do PC chinês.

No PT, em vez de oposição dentro do partido, partiu-se para a criação de novos partidos, visando assegurar espaço para os dissidentes. Nasce, assim, o PSOL e, depois, partidos mais à esquerda, como o PSTU. E todos eles rapidamente se estratificam, antes mesmo de se tornar poder. Hoje em dia, o único fator a ligar todos os militantes do PT, as diversas linhas, os intelectuais progressistas independentes, é Lula, a perspectiva de que volte ao poder. Cada vez mais o PT depende de Lula.

Sem a capilaridade do PT, as lideranças acabam dependendo do espaço que conseguem na grande mídia. E o espaço é garantido por críticas ao PT e, especialmente, a Lula. Cria-se uma aliança espúria entre líderes de esquerda e mídia, cuja liga é dada pela capacidade de criticar as lideranças de esquerda constituídas.

Há os exemplos aí de Randolfo Rodrigues fazendo aliança com a direita do Ministério Público Federal (alo, Randolfo, acorde: é direita sim!); Aldo Rebelo com a UDR; Cristovam Buarque com-quem-vier-eu-traço. E o PSOL desancando o PT; e os ativistas do PT desancando o PSOL.

Essa visibilidade, junto com o desgaste do PT, acaba promovendo festivais de onisciência, como essa ideia de Freixo, de lançar Guilherme Boulos à presidência. O próprio Boulos deve ter considerado ridícula a proposta.

Independentemente de seu reconhecido valor, Boulos representa um segmento único do corpo social, os sem teto. Nada a ver com o Lula e o PT dos anos 80, que tinha a Igreja, os sindicatos, os movimentos católicos, os pensadores da esquerda independente. Como pretender de Boulos um projeto de país?

No vídeo que colocou no Youtube, visando responder às críticas sobre a entrevista à Folha, Freixo salienta a importância das eleições, a união que haverá no segundo turno etc.

É compreensível que, para se diferenciar do PT, o PSOL faça críticas pontuais a pontos do programa de Lula. Os ataques intermitentes, o apoio à Lava Jato e outras concessões, no entanto, contribuirão para o acirramento das divergências e para o jogo desestabilizador da mídia.

O caminho da união passa pelo menor grau de sectarismo que vier a ser adotado pela nova direção do PT; e um amadurecimento maior das dissidências, em nome do objetivo maior, de restaurar a democracia.The Disaster Artist is definitely worth seeing. It's actually worth seeing more than once (which is what I'm going to do because I loved it so much). I haven't had this much fun in a movie since EVER! James Franco is a spot-on Tommy Wiseau who plays the character Johnny in The Room and James is amazing when he recreates The Disaster Artist scenes from The Room. Because James Franco put in so much dedication to this role, he is a wonderful Tommy and a wonderful director for the movie in general. He even stayed in Tommy's character when he was directing the movie!

That being said, I think in order to really enjoy this movie, you'll have had to see The Room first. Trust me, you will enjoy it!!! I saw it for the first time a year ago and I have probably watched it at least 50 times now. Yes, it is an awful movie! But that is WHY it's good. Tommy Wiseau is absolutely perfect in the movie because you just can't turn away. James Franco really captures his essence in The Disaster Artist. And, he is now nominated for Golden Globes due to how amazing the movie is.

The Disaster Artist is mainly about the relationship between the two main actors in The Room: Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero. And because of this, it is so interesting. They are the weirdest pair of best friends you could imagine! Tommy is so much older than Greg (even though he won't reveal his age or where he was born haha). This is why they're weird best friends. This shows that any friendship can flourish regardless of pointless differences. If two people click, they click. It's as simple as that.

Dave Franco plays Greg Sestero in The Disaster Artist. His performance wasn't amazing in my opinion, though. James Franco picked him to be Greg because he is his brother, and that is apparent. Even so, the storyline makes up for this. The other actors are decent, but the movie focuses on Tommy and Greg's relationship.

The scenes that James Franco recreates as Tommy Wiseau are absolutely perfect! He put sooo much into this movie. If you are a James fan and/or a Tommy fan, you will like this movie. I guarantee it!Ask the community

Mr. Rhodes, formally Mr.Obama's wormtongue, recently used tweeter to suggest he would like to see the Obituaries of VP Mike Pence, House Speaker Ryan, and Senate Majority Leader McConnell, on the front page of the NYT.

And remarkably, this piece of shit who used to work in the highest levels of government himself — never apologized for this, or retracted it!

With the tax plan passed, the Iranian people in the streets undoing his treachery and a Trump New Year upon us, today would be a good day for the FBI to put that treasonous SOB, who committed multiple felonies from inside the White House, behind bars where he belongs. The list of crimes he committed, even bragged about, is as long as an anchor chain, but they really should let the Secret Service, who used to protect him, bring him in.

© 2017 - 2019 KorenCZ11

Here's to 2018, may it be the best year yet.

Quick edit of th last pom picture. will not be the last.Former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke declared victory Saturday after Twitter users reported his tweets for inciting violence against media reporters who wrote about the FBI search warrant executed on his email account.

Winning against LYING LIB MEDIA and Whiney SNOWFLAKES again. Like @realDonaldTrump said, we'll win so much we'll get tired of winning. Not yet however. Diaper wearing lefty didn't like my metaphor reference to punching LYING LIB MEDIA in the nose. Twitter said no violation. Duh. pic.twitter.com/0drtWIEmMc — David A. Clarke, Jr. (@SheriffClarke) December 31, 2017

The company apparently said that his tweets did not violate their rules.

In case you missed it, Clarke was set off over the weekend after news outlets, including Law&Crime, wrote about the FBI executing a search warrant dated in March. He was accused of misusing his authority as Milwaukee County Sheriff to bully a man after a plane flight. When we reached out to him for comment Friday, he told us he was no longer under investigation, and showed us a letter from federal prosecutors: Authorities said they were dropping the case against him due to lack of evidence. Usually, the story would die out, but Clarke lashed out on Twitter with tweets like this.

I am UNINTIMIDATED by lib media attempts to smear and discredit me with their FAKE NEWS reports designed to silence me. I will continue to poke them in the eye with a sharp stick and bitch slap these scum bags til they get it. I have been attacked by better people than them #MAGA pic.twitter.com/XtZW5PdU2b — David A. Clarke, Jr. (@SheriffClarke) December 30, 2017

And this:

BREAKING NEWS! When LYING LIB MEDIA makes up FAKE NEWS to smear me, the ANTIDOTE is go right at them. Punch them in the nose & MAKE THEM TASTE THEIR OWN BLOOD. Nothing gets a bully like LYING LIB MEDIA'S attention better than to give them a taste of their own blood #neverbackdown pic.twitter.com/T2NY2psHCR — David A. Clarke, Jr. (@SheriffClarke) December 30, 2017

"When LYING LIB MEDIA makes up FAKE NEWS to smear me, the ANTIDOTE is go right at them," he wrote. "Punch them in the nose & MAKE THEM TASTE THEIR OWN BLOOD."

Obviously, he was angry about reports about the warrant. At least one other Twitter user reported claimed online to have reported him for inciting violence with the tweets. Indeed, Clarke's critics interpreted his posts as legitimately dangerous.

Here's a post from former presidential candidate, conservative Evan McMullin:

Eventually, someone inspired by threats like this is actually going to take violent action against a journalist. Twitter needs to decide what role it wants to play in tempting that fate and jeopardizing our free press. https://t.co/b3kjY6izLO — Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) December 31, 2017

Clarke defended his language by calling it a "metaphor." According to him, Twitter didn't think he broke the rules, and he put up a letter apparently from the company, which referenced the tweet about punching the "LYING LIB MEDIA." Sure, the platform prohibits threats of violence, but it seems like they didn't interpret the tweets this way.

Twitter did not immediately respond to a Law&Crime request for comment to clarify their rules. The company often catches flak for how it executes these policies. Critics, of all sorts of ideological stances, accuse the site of applying its harassment policy in inconsistent, or unfair ways. For example, right-wing pundit Ben Shapiro reported comedian Rosie O'Donnell, claiming he only wanted to to push back on the website being unfair to conservatives. Others, like Tablet magazine senior writer Yair Rosenberg, recently ripped the company for being soft on Nazi trolls using the platform.

Note: Twitter has since forced Clarke to take down the tweet.

Bringing you the best Lisk news of the week! Keep up to date with the Lisk blockchain platform in a few minutes read.

Liskmas Video

The Lisk team is working hard but they never forget to have some fun once in a while. This week the team released a video called : It's beginning to look a lot like Liskmas! The video gives us a peek inside the soon to be replaced working space of LiskHQ and as you can see the team was getting in a festive mood. The LiskHQ team is wishing the Lisk and entire crypto community happy holidays.

Growing Lisk Network

As we all know Lisk has grown immensely in 2017, not only has the price of the LSK token increased but more importantly the community is now bigger and stronger then ever. Over the last couple of months more and more people have been getting to know the Lisk project and are using the LSK token. This growth can also be seen in the Lisk network which this last month processed over 16% of all transactions since the genesis block back in May of 2016. We can only wait and see which new heights Lisk will reach in the 2018.

Lisk 2017 Review Video

This week the team released a Lisk 2017 review video in which the founders of Lisk Max Kordek (CEO) and Olivier Beddows (CTO) review what Lisk and its team have accomplished in this last year. One of these accomplishments is the way the Lisk team has grown. The Lisk team consisted of 3 people at the start of 2017 to now having 30 fulltime team members as of December. This is also why LiskHQ has decided its time to move from the WeWork Sony Center to a new workspace which is twice as big. In May of 2018 the team will then again move to a even bigger office where there will be room for up to a 160 people. Not only the LiskHQ team grew over 2017 but so did the Lisk community, the Lisk Twitter account now has over a 140.000 followers and the Lisk sub Reddit has over 22.000 subscribers. Another thing Lisk can be proud of is the community involvement, there have been 27 Lisk Meetups all around the world in 2017 of which 6 where LiskHQ meetups. Max also looks back on the Lisk Asia tour and the great support and responce they got from the Lisk Asia community. Max and Oliver round up the video by talking about what is in store for 2018 such as a Lisk science team, a dynamic fee system, the new Lisk address system and the further growth of Lisk.

Google Trends and Lisk Price Correlation

Google trends is a Google service which with the use of graphs and scores gives insight into when and how many times a certain word has been searched for on Google. When we look at Lisk on Google Trends we can see that the graph has a huge correlation with the LSK token price movement.

Follow Lisk on Social Media

The Lisk team is very active on social media but did you know that LiskHQ is active on 12 different social media platforms. Lisk for example has its own Twitter, sub Reddit, Gitter, Rocketchat, Github, Youtube, Instagram and many more. If you don't want to miss out on any of the Lisk news or updates then make sure to start following Lisk on some of these platforms.

Lisk.support

The Lisk.support team is proud to announce that the newly upgraded Lisk.support site is now live. Like some of you already know, the Lisk.support developers have been working hard on the new website for the last few months. But why was it time for a upgrade? The old Lisk.support website was becoming slow and a code spaghetti was not user friendly for our content creators. And because Lisk.support like Lisk wants to keep growing and keep the website fast for its visitors, this was a needed step. What have we changed? The developers have entirely rebuilt the Lisk.support website from scratch without any themes or heavy plugins, but still managed to make it user friendly for the content creators by integrating our own code into WordPress. We also thought about the future of Lisk.support and we've decided that Lisk news is becoming our main daily content together with media, like videos from famous crypto YouTubers and of course our own Lisk tools! We have a lot of ideas for new features and things to make the website even better and prettier in the future. We will continue to work on the website and your input is highly valuable for us, so if you have any feedback, please let us know by replying or sending us an email! To celebrate this new website, we are giving away 500$ worth of LSK tokens (sponsored by delegate Joo5ty) to one lucky winner! All you have to do is fill in a contact form, no voting for a specific delegate and no extra chances for the total LSK you own: everyone has the same chance of winning! Check out our latest blog for more info. Good luck and happy holidays from the entire Lisk.support team.

Let us know what you think about this weeks Lisk news roundup in the comments below!

31/12/2017 written by Lisk Community member E1337 (https://lisk.chat/direct/E1337)Thanks a lot for your comment <33 I was a bit hesitant about making the orange light brighter but I thought there would be too much contrasts between the dark parts and I didn't want Jewel to be too much covered by lights since it would make the image seems less darker but also it would hide his shading.



Yes I really wanted to do something different this time ! I usually mainly focus on the character only but this time I wanted to work more on the background. I really enjoyed working on the lights !

And there will be definitely more art of Jewel coming soon :3 I want to make a bust turnaround and the age and expression memes with him ! I'm bad with expressions and my characters usually seem younger or older than they are so it will be a good practice ;w;Cookies

Let's end the year right and bitchslap fucking Amway Ambots even if we can only do it virtually! I am the voice of the wives of all ambots. You know those nasty, horrible, despicable brainwashed robots who go around bragging that they're "business owners" because Amway gives their commissioned salespeople the bragging rights title of "Independent Business Owners".



Well fuck you Amway. There's a lot more to being a real business owner and running a legitimate business than scamming people into signing a restrictive Amway IBO registration agreement that takes away their rights as American citizens and human beings, forcing them to buy overpriced products, and making them shell out big bucks to attend Amway functions.



I prefer to save my fuck you's for my former upline but I'll just send out a big fuck you to Amway. Mostly that's because I'm still pissed off that a big corporation like them that sends out phony ass propaganda that they "care" about people and then has their employees come into work last year on Monday December 26 instead of doing the decent thing and giving them a day off and turning the Christmas weekend into a nice long 3 day weekend that most other businesses gave to their employees so they could spend more time with their families. Get a clue! Pissed off employees = low moral = low productivity. Actions speak louder than words. Have a little compassion for your employees especially at Christmas time. Don't take advantage of Christmas Day falling on a weekend to say tough shit that's just how it goes.



OK now that I got my Amway corporation fuck you rant out of the way back to the fucking upline assholes.



Amway is very much a good old boy's club. There are no women in a position of power. There are the wives of the Diamonds who sit on the stage looking adoringly at their warrior while he spouts off Amspeak motivational propaganda to the audience of ambots who paid big bucks to be brainwashed. There are no women running the show. Never. Even the lousy $10 meetings the Diamond speaker who showed up was always a man. No wife in sight for these little chump change meetings.



All the living room meetings were run by either the male Platinum or Emerald. The wives never spoke. Well, they might have spoke briefly if they happened to be in the room and the husband asked them to clarify something.



All the living room meetings we attended there would only be us and another couple, a lot of single guys in their 20's, and occasionally one or two single women also in their 20's. For the larger meetings where a Diamond showed up the room was still predominantly male, but a lot of wives accompanied their husbands, so maybe a quarter of the room would be female.



Us women can look around and get the picture real fast, especially after the speaker opens their mouth and there is usually no doubt left. We are listening to a male chauvinist pig. Happy there living in Stepford? Assholes!



Women like me have no tolerance for these new male playmates in our husband's lives. For the most part they are nothing but a bunch of fucking troublemakers ordering our husbands to buy shitty overpriced Amway products, shelling out money to attend Amway functions, demanding his presence at every living room meeting, ordering him to do this that and the other. These new fucking Amway playmates are destroying our lives and our relationships. Theses fucking Amway playmates demand our husband's time and his money and plenty of both.



If the relationships can tough it out, the only thing us women have on our side is time. Most IBO's quit within a year of registering with Amway. Unfortunately a few brainwashed idiots might stick it out a little longer but most quit eventually, except for maybe less than 5%. That would be a horror factory indeed if a woman is unlucky enough to be married to an ambot that is one of very few who stays with it, forever believing the brainwashed bullshit fairy tale about the thousands of dollars in residual income that will come rolling in every month for the rest of his life.



So on behalf of women everywhere who have been tortured by the Amway cult, a big fuck you to the asshole that sponsored our husbands into this mess. A big fuck you to our sponsor's sponsor. A big fuck you to every person in between them and the fucked up sack of shit Platinum. The biggest fuck you goes to the Platinum who is the evil bastard who carries out most of the dirty work. There may or may not be any legs between the Platinum and the Emerald but I don't want anyone to be neglected so a fuck you to any ambots inbetween. The Emeralds and the Diamonds can share in the fuck you's too. Miserable lying sons of bitches that stand up on the stage and scam you out of your money and insult you and call you losers if you don't keep plugging your cash into the Scamway system.



So there you have it. Not everyone out there believes the bullshit propaganda that you must submit to your upline and you must worship your upline. Fuck you to everyone that tries to force that down your throat! Not everyone loves and worships their Amway upline and has nice things to say about them! I am living proof of that one cursing out you nasty shithead ambots.



On behalf of ambot wives everywhere a collective fuck you to everyone in our upline. The lousy bastards who've cost us a lot of money, cost us to lose sleep, cost us divorces, cost us bankruptcy, cost us foreclosure, cost us happiness, cost us peace of mind. You fucking Amway troublemakers aren't happy until you've found some way to destroy our lives.



Not all of us are silent. This blog tells it like it is. The way we feel about you lousy upline bastards and what you say and what goes on at Amway meetings.



The women who don't have a voice. The women who are stuck in the Amway hell. The women who don't like to swear even though they really want to curse out their upline, the women who have had their lives disrupted or maybe even destroyed by whatever involvement their husband dragged them into the Amway cult.



I will speak up for you voiceless women. Your upline is my upline. We are all helplessly adrift in the same lifeboat. I will say it for you. The one thing we wish on you fucking Amway ambot assholes is that you are shit kicked for the lying, scamming, evil demons that you are and that you go through the same hell that you put us through.



A virtual bitch slap to every fucking asshole Amway IBO who has ever signed up a downline. That downline is me! And its always really nice to know what people really think about you isn't it?



Let's send out another big old FUCK YOU to every fucking Amway Ambot out there.











SCADA - Gateway to (s)hell Hacking industrial control gateways

Playlists: '34c3' videos starting here

Small gateways connect all kinds of fieldbusses to IP systems. This talk will look at the (in)security of those gateways, starting with simple vulnerabilities, and then deep diving into reverse-engineering the firmware and breaking the encryption of firmware upgrades. The found vulnerabilities will then be demonstrated live on a portable SCADA system.

Companies often utilize small gateway devices to connect the different field-busses used in industrial control systems (such as Modbus, RS232 etc) to TCP/IP networks. Under the hood, these devices are mostly comprised of ARM-based mini computers, running either custom, tiny operating systems or uClinux/Linux. The talk will look at the security aspects of these gateways by examining known and unfixed vulnerabilities like unchangeable default credentials, protocols that do not support authentication, and reverse engineering and breaking the encryption of firmware upgrades of certain gateways.

The talk will consist of a theoretical part, an introduction on how to reverse-engineer and find vulnerabilities in a firmware-blob of unknown format, and a practical part, showcasing a live ICS environment that utilizes gateways, from both the IP and the field-bus side, to pivot through an industrial control system environment: Demonstrating how to potentially pivot from a station in the field up to the SCADA headquarters, permanently modifying the firmware of the gateways on the way.

TagsThis tweet made me think.

The whole thread is worth a read. I'm sure many developers who are excited by code sometimes resonate with these feelings.

I promised a reply too lengthy for Twitter, and here it is.

First, some context: I remember first getting excited about computers in the Christmas of around 1982 or 1983 when my sister (8 years my older) got a Commodore VIC-20. I remember being 4 or 5 years old and thinking I would likely use it "better" than her in her early teens.

Every time I touched a computer from then on I got excited, but I didn't really get into learning how they worked properly until I was about 11 or 12. By the age of 18 I already knew C well enough to top classes in my fresher year at University, and by the age of 28 I had worked in the civil service, academia, multiple small businesses, peculiar corners of the World (the Falkland Islands are lovely), and was running a company helping small startups figure out what this tech revolution was all about.

I ended up CTO'ing for a few startups, and then in about 2014/2015 I realised I missed coding, resigned from my job, took a 30%-ish pay cut and went back to being a senior software engineer at a larger firm, where I remain.

Each of the tweets Saron sends in that thread encapsulates some aspect of my career that to an outsider can look one way, but actually, something else is going on.

Take for example:

Interestingly, I can respond to this with a tweet I made myself just a little while back:

Junior developers start with this expectation that if they just learn to code, they'll be done and then get their hours and they'll progress career wise. This is nonsense.

Coding for a living is learning for a living. If you don't like learning every single day, turn back now, or try and get a jump over into something less demanding from a learning perspective.

The more you code, the more you realise there are whole mathematical, theoretical, engineering and creative universes you do not understand, will never get around to understanding and therefore there is no point in pretending you do, will or can understand.

If you took me and another developer with a similar history, but the other party had spent their entire lives coding at banks, and put us in a pub together to have a chat, we'd have surprisingly little common ground.

We could talk about language semantics a bit. I'd know a lot more about web and app facing stuff more than they do. They might know more about compliance and perhaps strategies more appropriate for Enterprise setups. I'm spending a lot of time working on event sourcing at the moment, so we'd have common ground there but we'd call things by different names.

Add a game developer to our table, and we're likely going to sit quietly for a while until we all remember we all like Rick & Morty.

And that's what I think you're normally seeing when you see a self-deprecating senior. They don't actually think they're terrible, they just know their limitations and enjoy working within them, and have got past the point of bullshitting you into thinking they're experts at everything.

Next up in that thread:

The least important thing about a piece of software is the code. Sorry, but it's true, and the sooner everybody who comes to the career realises that, the more productive, happy and grounded they will be.

Saying that code is the most important thing is like saying the most important part of a new building is the architect's blueprints. You're not going to get far without them, but there is a hell of a lot of other stuff an architect has to do to make sure clients, local citizens, authorities, other architects, etc. are all pleased with the building.

Nobody won an architect's prize for a good drawing, and a piece of code that serves a need nobody has or does it in a way that unwittingly leaks personal data or breaks machines is not going to win high praise.

Language semantics are the equivalent of the language of an architect's drawing. Just as how an architect passes drawings to construction workers to realise, we pass our code to interpreters and compilers.

Just how some architects want to excel at civil engineering, some coders will get into the working pieces of languages.

Just how pre-fabricated houses are good value for money for those who don't care about architecture per se, you can go a long way with downloading or copying/pasting stuff and stitching it together.

Ultimately you have a responsibility as a professional to realise that your code has audience expectations, and it has responsibilities to that audience and others, and that's why it exists.

That doesn't mean you can't be proud of how you met or exceeded those expectations or responsibilities by expressing those needs in code itself, but until you accept in your heart of hearts that your job is to serve them as primary concerns through the language of code, and the code itself is no important than ink and paper is to writing, you are going to find this a brutal career.

I used to say software engineering is 80% communication and 20% writing code. I now think it's more like 95%/5% when done well, it's just that more of the communication can be done with other engineers through well designed and architected code.

I came back to coding because it's the best way I know to express myself whilst making a living at it. I can play a little piano badly, I'm a terrible artist, and whilst I enjoy writing it doesn't pay the bills.

Now, years ago, I had stacks of side projects lined up. Very few of them got worked on because real life gets in the way. Some of us just get more tired as we get older, some of us have families, I got ill without realising it and for the last two years have basically been having an issue that culminated in my losing the ability to walk (I'm mostly fine now, more here).

The point is, experience tells us getting too excited about those big ideas might lead to frustration as we might not get to work on them.

Don't let that stop you being excited about those things. Go build as much as you possibly can.

If you can and are willing, be not just productive, but prolific.

Your energy will wane as you age. That's OK. Your priorities in life will change. That's OK. You will narrow your field of interest. That might be OK, it might not be, it's normally best to keep your mind open to new fields especially in the first 30 years or so of your career.

Do not confuse though, those people who have prioritised other aspects of their life for people who have given up on the potential of what a developer with a good idea and the energy and skill to execute it well can do. Just remember though, we all know the names of Gates and Zuckerberg because there are only two of them: the odds are long, the glory is great, and it's yours if you want it.

But, you know, it's OK to not do that if you want to hang out with people, and in my personal experience, people are nicer to hang out with than computers. Think about that.

I tell a story sometimes about an encounter I had a couple of years ago. I was doing STEM outreach for the Royal Society via Salford University. One morning I found myself doing an assembly at Manchester Islamic High School for Girls.

Facing a room of 11–14 year old girls, most in head dress, some in burkas, I pulled up pictures of Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper, Gates, Zuck and others. I told those girls about how I saw their potential:

Few things you can choose to do in your life will allow you to have such an impact on the betterment of humanity, if you choose to better humanity with these skills.

With the laptop or PC you likely already have at home and some knowledge, you can create experiences for an audience of billions at virtually no cost other than your time. Those experiences can educate, entertain or enhance. They can turn people into superhumans of virtual Worlds in a game or titans of industry inside a spreadsheet. You can build mental muscles that leverage our capability as a species.

Writing code sits at a fascinating and beautiful intersection between the analytical world of Science and the expressive potential of the creative arts. It is professional, rewarding, and well-paid.

If you learn to code, and you enjoy it, the limit of your expression is entirely of your own making.

After giving an impassioned 20 minute speech on these lines, I sat down to listen to the next presenter: a woman from British Gas encouraging them to become boiler repair personnel so they could get their "own uniform and drive a van". I sighed at my society, picked up my laptop and left.

But I'm telling you now Saron, and all who feel as you do, that my thoughts remain unchanged and I'm now telling you these things.

Yes, I self-deprecate, yes I am too busy to get excited by absolutely everything, and yes I do prioritise my health and a balance in life to throw myself into the abyss of creatively coding like a maniac.

But do not ever mistake this for thinking we are signalling to you that you are naively making a mistake, that your excitement will eventually wane despite you not wanting it to, or that those of us with more experience than you right now think your enthusiasm is misplaced.

Godspeed, and good luck.In our previous post we looked at fuel efficiency solutions for industry, states, and organizations, and we started looking at how these solutions can be democratized to allow smaller players to get involved. We touched on emerging technologies that are offering new solutions for connecting fuel assets with management software to help make the process more automated and ubiquitous. Fuel reduction policies and fuel efficiency gains are great for reducing emissions related to the combustion of fossil fuels, but regardless of how much progress we make, we are still faced with residual CO2 emissions. It is tempting to stop there.

Anyone who implements and achieves efficiency gains can feel that they have done their part, and it is true that all efforts in this direction must be praised. But we are still short of being environmentally sustainable and we are still short of our final goal, that being 'climate neutral fuel'. This is where carbon mitigation comes into play. To make our reliance on fossil fuels sustainable, we have to reduce what we can and mitigate the rest.

What are Carbon-Neutral Fuels

Carbon-neutral fuels are a class of fuels or energy systems that produce no net greenhouse gas emissions. This means that their use does not add to the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gasses. These include certain synthetically derived fuels produced from sustainable or nuclear energy. Renewable energy sources such as wind turbines, solar panels, and hydroelectric power stations also produce carbon-neutral fuels as their use displaces fossil fuels.

Synthesised carbon-neutral fuels result from a chemical reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The resultant 'electrofuel' stores the energy that was used during the production of hydrogen. The carbon element that is captured at exhausts can make carbon-neutral fuels carbon negative. Researchers are also looking at producing dimethyl ether from methanol, which can be used in place of diesel fuel as it can self-ignite under high pressure.

Carbon-neutral fuels, however, are at a nascent stage of their development. Their applicability is limited and at best, they only address a small part of the fossil fuel problem. All efforts so far in carbon-neutral fuel aim to tackle fossil fuel replacement, but they do not do much do address the current emissions that result from their combustion.

Climate Neutral Fuel — a Unique Solution

At impactChoice, we take the carbon-neutral fuel idea to its next logical conclusion, where the final goal is environmental sustainability. Our Climate Neutral Fuel solution combines all the fuel reduction and efficiency aspects discussed in our previous post and then goes the last mile by adding carbon mitigation. This results in a true climate neutral fuel solution to the fossil fuels problem that will still persist for a long time into the future.

We combine the benefits of advanced fuel catalysts and lubricants that improve fuel efficiency of combustion equipment assets, such as vehicles and generators, and onboard instrumentation that monitors the operational performance of that asset, with advanced analytics and logistics software to monitor and optimize their use. Which allows us to achieve our first goal which is to "Reduce as much as possible".

We also calculate the emissions associated with each asset and then use our Carbon Asset Management system to mitigate those emissions, which is where blockchain plays a significant role. This allows us to achieve our second goal, which is to "Mitigate the rest".

This combination allows us to achieve our final goal, which is "Climate Neutrality".

This is an excellent climate neutral solution for our clients in big industry and large corporates. But this is only one sector of the economy. So how do we take things a step further?

The task at hand is to make all human activity that involves fossil fuel consumption sustainable. For our solution to scale to a level that would have a global impact, it has to be able to reach all sectors of our economies, from the largest fuel consuming companies and organizations, right down to the small businesses and even individuals. How do we get this out to the general populous, where the impact will be huge?

When looking for solutions that will make a lasting impact, you have to take the latest technological advances into account. You have to look as far forward into the future as you can by looking at what is possible today. Two of the most impactful technologies that will transform the way we use energy are the Internet of Things (IoT), and Blockchain enabled distributed ledger technologies.

Ubiquity, Automation and Universal Adoption via Smart IoT & Blockchain

It is not far-fetched to imagine a world where all our economic assets will have devices attached to them that can communicate with each other and be managed with advanced logistics management software. The devices can measure and respond to changing conditions. With combustion engines, devices can be set to monitor fuel mixtures, fuel levels, and combustion efficiency.

At industry scale, these devices can be software managed by a central controller or even fully automated with the use of smart contracts on blockchains. On the consumer level, these devices can communicate their findings and be managed through smartphone apps.

When you achieve this level of fidelity in measurement, you can now add carbon mitigation at various stages throughout the fuel chain. Imagine a company with a fleet of cars, each one being able to report its daily fuel use results, and each one being able to be accounted for and directly purchase mitigation credits, or pool the results to a central server that can make periodical buys. The buys can be coordinated by smart contracts so the whole process is seamless.

Achieving this level of definition also gives us the opportunity to add new levels of accountability to the process. Each fuel asset can add a periodic entry into a blockchain based immutable distributed ledger for all to see. As fuel is used and mitigated real time, the results can be made visible and live.

Just as stock exchanges play a vital role in giving signals to the buyers and sellers in a market, this level of openness and transparency can encourage new natural asset producers to invest and enter the natural asset market.

A Climate Neutral fuel solution is at hand. Implemented across all sectors of the economy at scale, it can make a huge impact on our environment.Recently, feminism has taken a hit. Guys you thought you could count on, like Louis CK or Senator Al Franken, have proven to be huge disappointments. We thought because they talked the talk that they could walk the walk. There's more to being a male ally than just words. It takes action. Real action. Voting for Hillary is easy. Asking women on Twitter if they're ok is easy. You know what's not easy, especially for us guys that just want to help get the message of feminism out there? Abstaining from harassing women. Which brings me to my point. We male feminists need to get laid more.

Look, no one wants to end male oppression of women more than male allies. Just ask us. But how are we supposed to help women when we're being sidelined with blue balls? I want to be out there with you, marching for equality, showing our Misogynist-In-Chief Donald Trump that we aren't afraid and we will never back down. But I have needs, you know? How am I supposed to campaign for women's rights when the very same women I'm trying to help refuse to give me sex? Is that equality?

Don't get me wrong. I respect women. I respect your independence, I respect your agency, and I respect your body. The feminine form is one of pure beauty and warmth, so don't you think you're being a little selfish when you refuse to have sex with me, even after I gave you a ride to the pro choice rally? It's not my fault anyway. I just find passionate, intelligent women to be very sexy. I'm not like those pigs who only want women for sex, I want to amplify female voices. I just think we'd be more united as a movement if you ladies weren't so uptight about me trying to kiss you on the way back from a Planned Parenthood fundraiser. I'm already on your side. What are you trying to prove?

Men like me are extremely valuable to feminism. You need me on your side. When I'm at a bar with the guys and someone makes a sexist remark, I'm the first and loudest one to remind them that's not ok. I've lost male friendships sticking up for women and if given the chance, I'd do it all over again. Isn't that worth a little sugar? I think I'm being pretty reasonable here. If feminists want to keep men like me on the front lines fighting for your equality, the least you could do is throw me a pity fuck once in a while.Many members of our community have expressed an avid interest in further details regarding the QASH token and our vision regarding its future utilization. In addition, details have been requested regarding our aspirations for the QASH Blockchain. This post addresses both issues from a high-level perspective.

QASH Use Cases

Expanding on Section 4 of the QASH ICO "WhitePaper"

QASH has two main functions:

1. as a Crypto Token, users can pay for services on all of QUOINE's platforms;

2. as a tradable Crypto Token on the open market.

In addition, the use of QASH will be made available to all financial and potentially any other industries who would like to leverage it.

To provide maximum flexibility, QUOINE will not limit the usage of QASH nor the type of business entities that would like to use QASH within their business. Therefore, any company, organization or individual will be able to utilize QASH as a Crypto Token — in the same way as Bitcoin's BTC, Ethereum's ETH and Ripple's XRP.

As the demand for the LIQUID Platform grows, the utility of QASH will increase and will allow QASH holders to use its inherent value as a payment vehicle for all services and functions QUOINE (and its partners) will provide. This usage will provide a network effect for the mainstream adoption of QASH.

Users should also note that QUOINE will offer a perpetual 5% discount when QASH is used as payment for QUOINEX and QRYPTOS services, thereby creating a natural demand.

All fees paid using QASH are discounted 5%. Users that do not own QASH will have the option to automate their QASH purchases. Whenever a fee comes due, the user will have the option of having the LIQUID Platform make a QASH purchase in the open market on their behalf. Users will also have the option to over-purchase as a means of accumulating QASH. E.g. Every time a fee comes due, instead of buying 100 QASH, buy 5% more or 105 QASH. For heavy users, this will allow QASH accumulation in rough proportion to their usage.

As the first ICO to receive regulatory approval from the Japanese government, we also see QASH sitting at the intersection of Finance and the Blockchain as a pro-regulation "light web" Cryptocurrency.

The QASH Life Cycle

Initially, QASH value will be used for services provided by the LIQUID Platform and QUOINE — to cover fees; as credit collateral, and to participate in trading strategies. QASH also becomes a base currency for trading at QUOINEX and QRYPTOS.

QASH holders can use its value in return for:

Transaction Fees

LIQUID Platform

QRYPTOS

QUOINEX

Prime Brokerage

Direct Market Access

Fiat Management

Crypto / Fiat Credit

Other Services

System Co-location

Automated Trading Strategies

Trading Tools

It is also important to note that QRYPTOS will be transformed into an ICO self-service platform where QASH can be leveraged as a base currency for participating ICOs. Future 3rd-Party ICOs can benefit from the security and KYC features already inherent in the platform.

As an added incentive, owners of QASH will receive periodic promotions, discounted fees, preferential access to new products//services, and exclusive opportunities to invest in future ICO//Token Sales that QUOINE will help launch.

As part of its evolution, QASH will start its life cycle as a ERC 20 utility token. When coupled with the power of the QASH Blockchain within the LIQUID Platform, QASH will naturally mature into a powerful Cryptocurrency.

At this point, we envision the use cases for QASH to be exponentially disruptive.

The QASH Blockchain

By way of background, QASH and the Liquid platform project began in Q2 of 2017 as an effort to tackle one of the largest problems facing the Crypto markets — liquidity.

As the team delved deeper into the problem, it became clear that solving this dilemma wasn't just about providing a bigger balance sheet. To be sure, any solution had to address the issues associated with connecting up liquidity silos, but there were other equally important factors holding back liquidity growth. The solution had to address issues around credit provision, counterparty risk, regulatory requirements, and information leakage. The more we evaluated the problem, the clearer it became that an ERC 20 token alone would not provide sufficient functionality. Thus, was born the concept of the QASH blockchain.

The QASH blockchain will serve as the backbone and the platform for QUOINE to develop its banking and financial services geared towards the new Crypto economy and in line with QUOINE's goal of the democratization of finance. This following describes some high-level characteristics.

The QASH blockchain will be built to natively support Decentralized Distributed Execution and to a great extent will be tailored to financial services, but not limited to them. As briefly discussed in the following sections, QUOINE is incorporating features and services based on best-of-breed blockchain technologies to provide an unparalleled level of versatility. The following are some of the key features of the QASH blockchain:

Intelligent Agents (aka Smart Contracts) — Easy scripting embedded in blocks or stationed/distributed across nodes. This will allow for the building of Programmable Assets and for features such as time-locks and others.

(aka Smart Contracts) — Easy scripting embedded in blocks or stationed/distributed across nodes. This will allow for the building of Programmable Assets and for features such as time-locks and others. Support for Erlang, Python, C++ and other programming languages (Go, Ruby). This will allow for development of sophisticated decentralized applications on the platform such as virtual asset exchanges, credit services, settlement services/distributed counterparty risk such as Continuous Linked Settlement, and other banking services, as this will serve as the base for QUOINE's banking platform.

QUOINE will look to the community and partners to develop virtual machines in support for other programming languages. Building support for well-known programming languages will allow the wider developer community to contribute to [d]apps development from day 1, as opposed to creating a new programming language (see Ethereum's Solidity) which comes with a learning curve.

Multi Asset and Decentralized Asset Transfers — with QASH being the native Cryptocurrency.

This will be controlled natively on the platform. Forgers participating in the validation network will be rewarded in QASH ONLY. QASH will serve as the fuel that will power the distributed execution services (Virtual Machines) and to pay for other native services such as asset transfers.

External Events Awareness will allow services running on the platform to interact with external events via specialized interfaces. This feature is essential to building financial applications and products on the platform.

will allow services running on the platform to interact with external events via specialized interfaces. This feature is essential to building financial applications and products on the platform. Most/all other decentralized platforms (Ethereum and others) do not provide support for external events as far as the author is aware, limiting their usability in real world financial applications.

At least one other exchange has tried and does not appear to have been entirely successful at building a decentralized market maker due to various issues including limitations with current smart contract technology.

Enhanced Scalability will ameliorate current concerns regarding Bitcoin and Ethereum Blockchain limitations.

Serving as a bridge between Fintech and traditional finance, additional envisioned QASH Blockchain functionality includes:

Seamless currency conversion (Fully exchange linked). Opt-in KYC (Traditional finance/compliance-officer friendly). Blockchain based Continuous Linked Settlement (Settlement of positions across liquidity providers). Multi-asset ledger for special-purpose value-stable assets (e.g. tokenized fiat used for settlement). An opt-in socialized loss mechanism (distributed insurance). Decentralized, trustless and non-custodial exchange-linked wallet — the user retains control and custody of their assets but a portion is locked up for settlement. Decentralized trustless lending. Lenders retains control and custody of their assets but the portion loaned is locked up for the term of contract Credit Scoring (already available in the existing platform). Trading Algos (already available in the existing platform).

We hope to position the QASH Blockchain to represent the next-generation architecture in Blockchain technology.Today in the cryptocurrency world it's hard to ignore the momentum, price movement and price appreciation without wanting to get involved by either building a position, swing trading, day trading or scalping current movers in the market. Not fighting the tape means positioning in the direction of momentum.

I was recently doing some research on a few ICOs and found one [link] that provides the top 20 trending cryptocurrency symbols that are currently in the news as well as what they call 'real-time interactive cryptocurrency charts' and was truly amazed at the insight one could garner from looking at high flyers of the last 24 hours through this lens. I decided to take few screenshots of these based on a strategy of positioning in cryptocurrency momentum plays that I've been using fairly successfully. Here they are:

Qtum (QTUM)

Combining a modified Bitcoin Core infrastructure with an intercompatible version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Qtum merges the reliability of Bitcoin's unfailing blockchain with the endless possibilities provided by smart contracts.

Designed with stability, modularity and interoperability in mind, Qtum is the foremost toolkit for building trusted decentralized applications, suited for real-world, business oriented use cases. Its hybrid nature, in combination with a first-of-its-kind PoS consensus protocol, allow Qtum applications to be compatible with major blockchain ecosystems, while providing native support for mobile devices and IoT appliances.

Conclusion

Some of these crypto plays have great teams, some great stories, some simply great momentum and price movements and some have all three and then some. Using Technical Analysis indicators may work quite well when targeting entry points for position plays or quick day trades. In either case, some day you might want to learn how to short as well as go long or hedge all together. Happy trading!Background

Text adventure games are video games in which the primary interaction occurs via text entered by and delivered to the player.

Historically, text entry was provided via a physical keyboard, and text was delivered to the screen, but these games don't necessarily require a keyboard or a screen, so long as text can be delivered to the player, and commands can be submitted by the player.

Text Adventure Games deliver a description of a location or game scenario, then player interacts with the game by entering commands for the protagonist of the game to perform.

Commands can be entered such as:

TAKE CUSHION, DROP CUSHION, LIGHT FIRE, GO EAST, ENTER CABIN, INVENTORY, WEAR COAT, REMOVE SHOES, SLEEP

This style of game was mainstream in the late 1970s through to the mid-80s but after the birth of graphical adventure games, the popularity sharply declined.

Early text adventures were of a pure textual nature. You type text, you receive text.

Adventureland by Scott Adams — Text Only Version

There is a purity to this approach, but as hardware became more sophisticated, it became possible to package graphics alongside the text.

Text Adventure games do not have to mean that a game is devoid of graphics. Later games had primitive static graphics (or static graphics with basic animations).

The Hobbit by Melbourne House — Text Adventure with Graphics

Later games had more sophisticated graphics, and animations.

Create / Play

Adventuron is a model-based adventure creation language and game engine. It uses the same approach used by Scott Adams, Quill, PAW, GAC, and other early adventure systems.

The Quill (Use Manual)

Adventuron's actual game engine is designed to feel as if it is executing on an 8-bit computer such as a ZX Spectrum, C64 or Apple II.

Development Environment

If you have a PC with a browser, then you can start authoring games with Adventuron here.

The context-sensitive code completions shown below are triggered using CONTROL + SPACEBAR.

Adventuron uses a two panel web based IDE, the left panel to edit code, the right panel to test the adventure.

You can also maximise the game-play panel to full screen by double clicking or double touching inside the text window

Gameplay

Adventuron is unashamedly anachronistic. Old-school text adventures used to feature a number of locations, paths between locations, objects in the gameworld, puzzles to be solved using textual inputs, and usually using items in your possession.

A cliche example of a puzzle is, when faced with a locked door, you must have a key in your possession to unlock the door, and until the door is unlocked, you can't enter a room, that has a another object to be used elsewhere. There can be dozens of overlapping puzzles.

Adventuron introduces light programming concepts such as variables, conditional statements and instructions. Adventuron should be quite useful as a first programming language once a few tutorials are created.

Getting Started With Adventuron

Adventuron is text file based. For simplicity sake, the entire game logic is described in a single file, including all graphics. We call this file a source code file.

A source code file is somewhat human readable, but it must be in a certain format in order for the computer to understand (or parse).

Adventuron uses tables to set up the adventure game, the descriptions, the objects, the graphics and interesting events that can happen during the adventure.

The core table used by Adventuron is the locations table. This table contains a list of all the locations in the game.

Think of these tables as lines on a piece of graph paper with several columns. An Adventuron game MUST contain at least one location. So, how do we enter this table into Adventuron?

In the snippet below, we define one location named "drive", and we also set the start location of the adventure to the "drive" location. We also set the "start_location" to match the identifier of the "drive" location.

Playing the Adventure

If you have typed the adventure as shown here, then we have a valid adventure, so press the "play" icon at the top right of the editor half of the screen to start running the adventure game.

Adventuron depends on a file being in the correct format, if not the header of the editor window will turn red, and the line number of the fault will be displayed.

To play the adventure, type commands into the window on the right hand side. Here are some system commands that are supported without any additional code:

northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, north, up, down, enter, exit

get item

drop item

wear item

remove item

inventory

look

load

save

quit

score

Currently, Getting and dropping of items will result in the game telling you that there is no object present to get or drop.

" Inventory " will list objects you are carrying.

" will list objects you are carrying. " look " will redescribe the current location.

" will redescribe the current location. " save " will save the game to a textfile

" will save the game to a textfile " load " will load a saved game to a textfile

" will load a saved game to a textfile " quit " will quit the game then restart the game afresh (after confirmation).

" will quit the game then restart the game afresh (after confirmation). " wear " and " remove " are usually intended for items of clothing. None has been configured for this game.

" and " " are usually intended for items of clothing. None has been configured for this game. All directions (north, east, northeast, etc.) will results in a message informing the player that they cannot travel in this direction (as we configured only one location).

Adventuron supports overriding each of these commands and adding new commands as required by the adventure.

Adventure Game Loop

The game loop executes using fixed logic and within this game loop, the game author can attach events or data to be associated with a lifecycle stage.

That is, after text is entered, then the text that the user entered is checked against a number of fixed responses to text in certain patterns, then a number of actions (or conditional actions) can be executed.

The following video outlines the editing process.

How to create an adventure.

Study the tutorial adventure. Press Ctrl+A on the tutorial adventure. This will select all text. Press the backspace or DEL key on the keyboard(to wipe out all text). Press Ctrl + Space in the empty space to make template blank adventure game. Create locations, objects, and event handlers for your adventure. Iterate, and use the embedded documentation.

More Features

Import Maps via Trizbort

Adventuron supports importing map files via the excellent Trizbort mapping tool. At the moment, the import is one-way only, but later releases should support two way editing.

Making New Feel OldMark was the stuff of dreams. Kind, caring, attentive, enough to make all of my friends jealous. But today something happened, something horrible. Something I wouldn't wish on even my worst enemy. I found out something about Mark that will forever change my opinion about him, and my ability to trust men has been forever shattered.

Shortly after dinner, my best friend Jessica called me and told me she had some information to share with me about Mark. I begged her to just tell me over the phone, but she insisted that it had to be in person. So we met up an hour later at the Jitterbug Cafe, our favorite java-spot to sip cappuccino and check out acoustic guitar music on a Friday Night. However, tonight the sound of acoustic guitar music would be replaced with the sound of tears, sniffling, tissues being removed from tissue packets, and other sounds that indicate that something sad is happening.

It was there at the cafe that Jessica told me the bad news: Mark is actually just a couple of old hot dogs inside of a very tiny, mohair sweater.

At first I couldn't believe the words she was saying as they were coming out of her mouth. I'd heard of this happening to other girls, but I never thought it would happen to me. But the more I thought about it, the clues all started to add up; his occasional odor of old hot dogs, his refusal to ever speak and his inability to walk across the room on his own accord.

I asked Jessica to explain to me how she found out the truth about Mark. She told me that she started to piece it all together when she observed a text message conversation between Mark and I. She noticed that Mark wasn't responding to anything I was saying to him. And that's because he's a couple of old hot dogs, and hot dogs can't text.

And even though Mark was the star point guard in our school's basketball team, nobody could ever recall Mark actually participating in any of the games. Instead he would always just sit on the sidelines; typical behavior for a person that is not really a person but really just a couple of generic hot dogs inside of a mini sweater.

But perhaps the most revealing moment was last week at Nolan's bonfire, when Mark was actually mistaken for a pack of hot dogs. We all laughed it off. "How hilarious! Rachel just thought Mark was a pack of hot dogs! Maybe take it easy on the buzz juice, Rachel!" And although Rachel does seem to have a problem with alcohol consumption, this was the night that Jessica finally realized the truth about Mark.

This is a reality facing young girls everywhere today: somewhere out there, someone is knitting tiny, little mohair sweaters, filling them with stinky, old hot dogs and then putting them into circulation as real people. Often they go ignored; faceless in an endless sea of people. You may have sat across from one on a crowded bus without even noticing. But other times they're courted by young, vulnerable girls whose only mistake is that they're looking for love in a world that is so, so cold.

I really thought I was going to marry Mark, that he was going to be the one. My friends got along with him, my family approved. I never thought he would do this to me: reveal that he was actually just a couple of old frankfurters nestled within a sweater fit for a newborn. But I suppose if there's one thing that I've learned from this whole ordeal, it's that not everybody turns out to be the person you think they are.I like my Christmases engulfed in powdery snow, but growing up in Canada's freezer it's the odd green December that appears most vividly in my memory. For some people, their first experience with OutKast has nothing to do with shaking Polaroids and everything to do with Christmas—"Player's Ball," for my money one of hip hop's finest holiday tunes ever committed to record, was André "3000" Benjamin and Big Boi's formal introduction to the masses. And it was a bold one at that; instead of rhyming about prancing elves, they hit listeners upside the head with dynamic flows and refreshingly subversive lyrics (Dré suggests reactionary purists "shut up that nonsense about some silent night" because he "gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right").

The two emcees from Atlanta's East Point brought hip hop to Christmas ... or rather seized Christmas by the balls and decked its halls with rattling Cadillac Seville trunks and crude liberation. Dark-emerald woodland, dusty roads, asymmetrical housing, beautiful women, crumbled 'erb, filthy rum and soulful music — all things "Player's Ball" might evoke. About the only traditionally "Christmas" aspect of the song is the sleigh bell that sets the tone for what ultimately becomes a celebratory ode to the hustler's lifestyle.

A silk-smooth, debonair chorus sung by Sleepy Brown of Organized Noize helped propel the tune to certified Gold status, and OutKast proved that black folk in the South had something important to say, a multiplex audio-visual story worth following. Their voice would only grow louder, and it still reverberates far and wide today amidst the grating screech of Donald Trump & His Gutless Thugs. OutKast offered the uninformed public a peripheral awareness of XMAS — shedding light on the vapid institution of annual mad-dash consumerism. Moreover, if Santa had witnessed first-hand what then-teenage Dré and Big Boi were conjuring up in their Dungeon, he would have returned to the North Pole with a hell of a lot more funk in his hair and some fresh boom for his pockets.

If you've been following the cryptocurrency market over the past year, you have most likely seen an explosion in the number of new ICOs. This development has clearly showcased the disruptive potential of blockchain technology. However, it has also brought a lot of complexity, which might be very hard to navigate. At WePower, we are constantly striving to help our community navigate through the complexity of the energy sector and its blockchain applications. This is why in this post we want to share a summary of why we believe WePower stands out in the landscape.

Take a look at these 10 reasons why WePower might be the next best blockchain company to support. Each of these reasons can serve as a great starting point helping you understand the key values of WePower.

1. We're Bringing a Powerful Revolutionary Product

WePower disrupts green energy finance market by creating global access to capital for green energy project developers, opening it to buyers and investors across the globe and providing liquidity.

With WePower, green energy project developers can raise funds for their projects by issuing tokens, and then selling them to the energy buyers and investors. These tokens, in a form of smart contracts, represent a commitment to produce and deliver energy to the token holders. Because of WePower's simple and cost effective fundraising method, green energy can be sold upfront at below the market cost; and, as a result drastically increase green energy production across the globe.

These Energy tokens are internal platform tokens. WePower also grants a WPR token (described bellow) to the contributors, which accumulates energy and provides priority access to the energy plant auctions.

2. Our Vision's Credibility Is Backed by International Partnerships

WePower's innovative approach to producing, consuming, and investing in renewable energy has already attracted strong partners:

WePower was selected to join Australia's Startupbootcamp Energy Australia Accelerator (SBC). SBC is the second largest accelerator program globally, and the first to invest in a company doing a token sale. As part of the SBC Energy Australia program, WePower will be supported by some of the biggest energy companies in Australia, including Energy Australia and Spotless;

3. Our team is built to deliver in all key areas of the business

Our team is comprised of some of the most talented energy experts, engineers and developers who're committed to seeing our vision through, including:

Nikolaj Martyniuk, our CEO with 10 years of experience in energy project development

Kaspar Kaarlep, our Chief Technology Officer and an ex-CTO of a national DSO

Arturas Asakavicius, our COO with legal background in crowdfunding and Fintech

David Allen Cohen, our award-winning Energy Advisor

Jon Matonis, our Blockchain Advisor and Chairman of Globitex

Eyal Hertzog, our Token model advisor, co-founder of Bancor

Liraz Siri, our Security Expert and Co-Founder of TurnKey Linux.

4. We're Working Together with the Leading Experts in the Crypto Ecosystem

WePower has the support and partnership with some of the most talented and experienced minds in cryptocurrency, including Alignment Ventures. Alignment has been the driving force behind the success of a number of coin projects, including Stox and Kik, and is working with WePower to ensure that our business strategy are optimized for maximum effectiveness.

5. Our WPR Token is a versatile asset with a clear value appreciation mechanism built-in

Our WPR tokens issued to the contributors are designed to continuously grow in value together with the WePower expansion. This is due to the fact that green energy producers using the WePower platform are required to donate 0.9% of their tokenized energy to WePower investors, who can then decide whether to use or sell their tokens once the energy has been produced.

Moreover, WPR tokens give holders priority access to participate in the energy tokens' auctions, where energy can be bought for the best price. This creates an additional market demand for the token because of an additional demand for a token coming from the large green energy buyers.

WPR tokens will also be integrated with the Bancor Protocol, which will provide additional and continuous liquidity for WPR token holders by allowing WPR owners to convert their tokens to any other token in the Bancor NetworkTM.

6. WPR token can be bought using a currency of your choice

Our mission at WePower is to revolutionize green energy by making it accessible to all.

One of the ways that we're able to reach this vision is by giving investors and customers greater options when contributing to WePower.

This also means that during the pre-sale you can contribute to the green future using Ethereum, Bitcoin, various other altcoins, and even FIAT currency through BlockEX . BlockEx already provides solution to buy tokens using your credit card.

Updated: January 16th: Due to the necessity of individual caps, we had to modify our token sale smart contract. In order to make this modification fully functional and secure with the time constraints we have, some of our payment partnerships had to be changed. Therefore, it will also not be possible to buy tokens using BlockEx services.

7. WePower Opens the Possibility to Invest in the Energy market

Historically, the energy sector has been a closed market for all but institutional investors. Because of this, most people weren't able to take advantage of the stability and profitability that comes with investing in renewable energy.

With the help of WePower, the days of closed energy markets are over. Thanks to blockchain technology and WePower's global platform, investors from all over the world can invest in renewable energy before it's produced at optimal prices and sell it when there's a higher ROI — which, in some cases, could be as much as 20%.

8. WePower brings Transparency and Innovation to the PPA Market

Blockchain technology helps WePower to innovate existing Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) market, where agreements to produce and deliver energy for a fixed price are concluded for 20–25 years. This market is closed and only big companies participate in it (producers, big corporates and energy market makers). It lacks liquidity. WePower disrupts this market by dividing each PPA to 1kWh PPA and putting them on the Blockchain. It opens PPA market to everyone (end users, speculators), providing liquidity and creating global access to capital for green development projects.

9. Green energy market needs a financial boost

Major cities across the world are pledging to cut carbon emissions and go completely green in the years to come. Despite this, between 2015 and 2016, the renewable energy market reached a negative growth of -23% due to poor planning and lack of investment big banks, hedge funds, and PE funds.

This is where WePower comes in. Thanks to our open energy investment platform, investors from all over the world can invest in renewable energy.

We recognize that energy production is big business, with $242 billion USD being invested into renewables every year. With our help, countries can realistically make the switch to 100% renewable energy, which should push the market size from $2.3 trillion USD up to as much as an estimated $11.5 trillion USD over time.

For investors, now marks the perfect time to enter the green energy market while the industry is still growing.

10. WePower Helps to Fight Climate Change

The problem with the energy sector is that there's not been a strong enough push towards renewable energy. Our dependence on dirty energy is having a negative impact on the environment. Reductions of emissions has to be as great as 80–95% by 2050 in order to prevent sea levels from rising and instability in the ocean's pH levels.

With the assistance of WePower's inclusive platform, we're able to build a cleaner tomorrow without having to cut back on energy consumption.

And we're able to achieve that by increasing green energy accessibility globally, as well as creating a transparent system that accounts for co2 emissions honestly and transparently — and that's win-win for everyone.What a year in the crypto ecosystem! I tend to try and ignore prices and concentrate on the project but it has been impossible to miss that the entire crypto ecosystem has grown to nearly 0.6 trillion dollars this year. Quite incredible for those of us who have been in the scene since 2012/3 patiently waiting for the world to see what we first noticed all those years ago. Such innovation and growth in the space is awe-inspiring. Crypto as an asset class and internet payment layer has well and truly arrived.

This is a long post so lets get through the big stuff first — the timing and details of the launch!

Roadmap changes — mainnet launch mid Q1 2018

To launch as soon as possible we have made some major changes to our roadmap.

Those who know the project intimately are aware we have been diligently iterating our Proof-of-Stake protocol for several months on our public testnet.

We have made great progress, but our plan to launch on low power devices (Pi 3 and above) with our current protocol is proving challenging and has repeatedly pushed back our mainnet release in recent weeks.

We need to make some modifications to our protocol, further test these extensively and open it to peer review. This will take at least another 4–6 months to complete properly to enterprise level.

Security is everything for the QRL. We are using PQ-recommended XMSS to secure our accounts and transactions. We cannot compromise our launch with an immature POS protocol given how much value our project currently carries — and more importantly how much value it will hold in the future.

It is also vital we do not delay our launch further as prospective partners wishing to integrate with the QRL require a working chain and it is important we launch as #1.

With this in mind we made a big decision earlier this month to launch sooner with a temporary proof-of-work(POW) algorithm — cryptonight, used on monero/XMR, and hard fork to POS in Q3 2018.

Proof-of-work is battle-tested in the wild since 2009 and is massively simpler to integrate. We have already fully adapted qrlcore to POW in our private developer testnet and aim to launch in mid Q1 2018 with an internal countdown already started. Feature freeze has occurred already. We are preparing for external audit.

Token migration

Token migration allowing users to move their ERC20 token balance to a burn address and be automatically included in mainnet launch will open next month. A blog post explaining the process in detail is on the way shortly after the New year. Users who don't migrate in time for our mainnet launch window will, of course, still have the option later to unlock their coins safely.

Discussions with exchanges are ongoing — we are not at liberty to reveal anything new at this time!

Proof-of-stake transition

Through 2018 we will maintain three QRL networks :

Mainnet-POW. Testnet-POW. Testnet-POS.

Full-time development and protocol testing will continue (and in fact expand) through 2018. As part of our regular hard fork schedule we will hard fork to pure POS in Q3 2018.

QRL emission schedules remain unchanged with 2399544.94 QRL (3.54% of available supply, 2.18% of total supply) expected to be mined prior to the transition to POS and staking.

Ephemeral messaging

Our blockchain overlay messaging layer is now integrated into the codebase — utilising reference Dilithium and Kyber implementations. We now have three different post-quantum secure cryptographic systems built into the QRL.

This allows much of our exciting layer two functionality to now come online!

Team expansion continues into 2018

We will shortly be announcing three new full-time members of the team working in UX, mobile and an additional core developer. More on this in the coming days. The QRL remote office is becoming a busy place to reside.

Additionally we are delighted to add another advisor, Robby Dermody, to the team. He is a founder of the Counterparty project and has already proved an excellent addition to our growing project.

Conferences 2018

Our QRL team is scattered across the globe — from the UK, US and Canada, to the Netherlands, India and Australia.

We will be venturing outdoors and attending the following conferences to raise the profile of our project publicly in the first half of 2018 — BlockDelhi, APAC Australia, CryptoValley and the Blockchain Global Expo. We also plan on potentially adding more conferences to the first half of 2018 (i.e. Consensus 2018), with more to come in the second half of 2018!

I hope we can meet many of you at these events and spread the word of our project far and wide. Look out for the blue/purple QRL logo t-shirts!

Mainnet launch featureset

We will ship with the following featureset in Q1 2018.

multi-platform qrlcore node release. 100% PQ-secure address space for the QRL (XMSS) cryptonight POW algorithm, 1 minute block-time interval, ability to mine in existing pools, using existing mining software. ephemeral messaging layer capability (PQ-secure end-end data channel functionality utilising Kyber and Dilithium). completely separated wallet and node functionality with all wallet-based requests passing through the node by our universal grpc api. Use of slave XMSS tree signing capability to allow secure mining (and later in the year staking) keeping private keys offline. GUI-based webwallet and full block explorer functionality PQ-token capability out of the box — creating tokens on the QRL chain is now functional. PQ-secure data stamping functionality out of the box.

In addition we are working very hard to implement full XMSS signing on the Ledger Nano, and expect a prototype WhatsApp-style PQ-secure messaging app to be available around the time of mainnet launch to show off early Ephemeral capabilities.

TLDR

QRL goes live mid Q1 2018 with a transition from POW to POS via hardfork Q3 2018. ERC20 to QRL Token Migration commences next month. Team grows with several new members on the way and a new advisor

Countdown to a fully post-quantum secure blockchain has begun.

Happy New Year to everyone from the QRL team: Adam, Aidan, Andrew, Burke, Elliott, Jack, JP, Juan, Kaushal, Leon, Michael, Scott and myself!Quick Guide: How to Buy Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies

DISCLAIMER: This is not investment advice and readers should note that cryptocurrencies are high risk and volatile investments. This is my personal advice as a successful investor in the crypto markets. Note that I have included my referral links to Coinbase and Binance trading platforms. Although it is not required by you to use my referrals in benefits you as Coinbase will give you and I both $10 USD worth of Bitcoin for your first $100+ invested.

This guide serves to assist you in purchasing some of the most well known and upcoming cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin.

Basic Strategy to purchasing your first CryptoCurrency

So far this seems to be the most basic and simple steps for people looking to buy their desired Crypto investments

1. First, register with a Coinbase.com account. Coinbase is easy to work with and has an app in the Apple store and Android store for downloading. It is currently the most trusted exchange for beginners and is how most people have started their investment journey into the world of cryptocurrencies.

2. Go through the verification process. This requires at least one form of ID. Coinbase takes no more than 10 minutes to have your account and ID officially verified.

3. You will now be able to enter whichever method of payment you prefer. This can be via bank transfer or credit/debit card etc.

4. After payment details are entered you are able to purchase either Bitcoin, Ethereum, LiteCoin or BitcoinCash. (If you plan on buying other known CryptoCurrencies on a bigger exchange, it's best to start with Ethereum as it has the fastest transaction times and lowest fees.)

5. Register with Binance.com. This is the largest exchange by volume currently and they trade almost all the popular lesser known alternative and upcoming CryptoCurrencies, including Ripple, Monero, IOTA and NEO etc. Furthermore you can trade and withdraw up to 2BTC (currently about $25'000) worth per day without requiring ID. Those who wish to buy and withdraw more than that will need to submit ID. Note: A list has been included at the end of this article showing all the coins currently available to trade on Binance.

6. Once you have registered with Binance you will have free wallets on the exchange for every Crypto currency that it offers. In order to trade on Binance you will need to use either Ethereum or Bitcoins that you have purchased.

7. You may then transfer your Ethereum or Bitcoin to the Binance wallet given to you under the "FUNDS" tab from your Coinbase Account. Note that you must enter the address on your Bitcoin or Ethereum wallet correctly or it will not go through. Always double check that you are depositing the right Coin and the address has no mistakes.

8. Once sent to your Binance wallet, you may now trade your Bitcoin or Ethereum for whichever coin you wish. Just remember that transfer times vary and are not instant for Ethereum (10 minutes+) and Bitcoin (1 to 24 hours).

Note: My referral codes are as follow for those of you who have not yet signed up with the exchanges mentioned:

Coinbase: https://www.coinbase.com/join/59b61e432f6cbe011674a30f

Cheers and Good luck to you all

NEBL/BNBWestern energy majors court Assad

CGGVeritas was also licenced by the British government for the North Sea, where for the last several years Bowman has held responsibility for identifying prospectivity and coordinating licencing round activities.

In 2012, the US Department of the Interior published a US Geological Survey Minerals Yearbook, which observed that Assad's government-owned Syrian Petroleum Co.:

"... cooperated with several international oil companies, such as Chinese National Petroleum Co. (CNPC), Gulfsands Petroleum of the United Kingdom, Oil and Natural Gas Resources Corp. of India, Royal Dutch Shell plc. of the United Kingdom, and Total SA of France through subsidiary companies."

Two years earlier, the Syrian capital, Damascus, was host to the 7th Syrian International Oil & Gas Exhibition, convened by Assad's Ministry of Petroleum. The exhibition was sponsored by CNPC, Shell, and the French major Total, and was attended by over a hundred representatives of international firms, 40% of whom were based in Europe.

A 2010 draft document produced on behalf of the Syrian Ministry of Petroleum by the exhibition organiser, Allied Expo, described how British company Shell was planning to work closely with the Assad regime to develop Syria's gas production:

"Shell will devise a master plan for the development of the gas sector in Syria, following an agreement signed with the Ministry of Petroleum," say the presentation slides, created in October 2010 to promote plans for a new oil and gas exhibition in 2012. "The agreement includes an assessment of the overall undiscovered gas potential in Syria, potential for upstream gas production, need for gas transmission and distribution networks..."

Slide from 2010 Syrian Ministry of Petroleum presentation (mistake in final sentence is from the original)

Throughout 2010, Shell officials held numerous meetings with British government ministers. In July, Shell met David Cameron to discuss "business issues", Foreign Office minister David Howell to discuss "international energy matters", and Charles Hendry, minister of state at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC).

Slide from 2010 Syrian Ministry of Petroleum presentation

Such meetings with multiple government departments and often dozens of senior officials continued for every month through to the end of the following year, except June 2010. These included meetings with the Prime Minister's National Security Advisor Peter Ricketts; business secretary Vince Cable, various DECC ministers to discuss "energy issues" related to Qatar, along with several sessions with Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne.

Declassified British government memos show that in the run-up to the 2003 Iraq invasion, oil firms BP and Shell held several meetings with senior government officials to guarantee a role of British energy companies in post-conflict Iraq.

While publicly the government decried criticisms of an oil motive for British involvement in the war as "the oil conspiracy theory", one memo of a meeting between then Trade Minister Baroness Symons and UK oil firms revealed that in private, they believed "it would be difficult to justify British companies losing out in Iraq in that way if the UK had itself been a conspicuous supporter of the US government throughout the crisis."

Slide from 2010 Syrian Ministry of Petroleum presentation

After the 2011 protests, even when Assad was brutalising demonstrators in the streets, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ruled out military intervention and insisted that the Syrian dictator was a "reformer" — which he took as a green light to escalate his crackdown.

As the cycle of violence intensified, Western governments disassociated from Assad when it became clear his rule had become completely unstable. With the outbreak of civil war, the plans of Shell and other oil majors to open up Syria's offshore resources were unexpectedly suspended.

Military action to protect Mediterranean oil and gas

The sudden crisis in Syria threw a spanner in the works for longstanding efforts to explore and open up lucrative energy resources in the Eastern Mediterranean.

A report published in December 2014 by the US Army's Strategic Studies Institute (SSI) provides compelling evidence that American, British and Gulf defence strategists see the Mediterranean as an opportunity to wean Europe off dependence on Russian gas, and boost Israel's energy independence.

As part of this process, the report revealed, military action is viewed as potentially necessary to secure Syria's untapped offshore gas resources, which overlap with the territorial waters of other Mediterranean powers, including Israel, Egypt, Lebanon, Cyprus, Greece and Turkey.

The report by Mohammed El-Katiri, an advisor to the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Defence and formerly a research director at the UK Ministry of Defence's (MoD) Advanced Research and Assessment Group (ARAG), explicitly acknowledges that a post-conflict Syria would open up new prospects for energy exploration.

"Once the Syria conflict is resolved, prospects for Syrian offshore production — provided commercial resources are found — are high," wrote El-Katiri. Potential oil and gas resources can be developed "relatively smoothly once the political situation allows for any new exploration efforts in its offshore territories."

The US Army SSI report noted that Syria's offshore resources are part of a wider matrix of oil and gas deposits in the Levant basin encompassing the offshore territories of these competing states.

The region is estimated to hold approximately 1.7 billion barrels of oil and 122 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, which could be just a third of the basin's total hydrocarbons.

US-led military intervention has a key role to play, the report concludes, in "managing" conflicts and tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean, especially the prospect of "Syria destabilising into de facto civil war."

"US diplomatic and military support has a pivotal role to play in the East Mediterranean's complex geopolitical landscape, and its importance will only grow as the value of the natural resources at stake increases," the Army SSI report said:

"US security and military support for its main allies in the case of an eruption of natural resource conflict in the East Mediterranean may prove essential in managing possible future conflict."

Neocons angling for Syria's Golan oil bonanza

One of the key potential conflicts flagged up by the report is between Syria and Israel, over oil exploration licenses granted by the Israeli government to search for oil in the Golan Heights.

The Golan was captured by Israel from Syria in 1967, and unilaterally annexed in 1981 with the introduction of Israeli law to the territory.

The report recognised the risk of "another armed conflict between the two parties should substantial hydrocarbon resources be discovered."

The company that has been granted exploration rights in the Golan Heights is a major American firm, Genie Oil and Gas. Data from exploratory wells explored by Genie's Israeli subsidiary, Afek Oil and Gas, confirmed "significant" quantities of oil and gas after drilling into a column of reserves 1,150 feet thick, "about 10 times larger than the global average."

Yuval Bartov, Afek's chief geologist, recently told the Economist his firm had discovered an oil reservoir "with the potential of billions of barrels."

Equity-holding board members of Afek's parent company, Genie Oil and Gas, include global media baron Rupert Murdoch.

In late 2010, Murdoch teamed up with Lord Jacob Rothschild to buy a 5.5% stake in Genie, worth around $11 million. Lord Rothschild is chairman of RIT (Rothschild Investment Trust) Capital Partners, a $3.4 billion investment trust fund formerly associated with the Rothschild investment bank.

RIT Capital invests primarily in public equity, debt markets, real estate equities, gold and oil, including "sectors that we have a deep knowledge of" such as "energy, resources, financial services, TMT [technology, media and telecommunications] and consumer-related."

Murdoch is the owner of News Corporation, the world's second largest media conglomerate before it split in 2013 into News Corp, where he is executive chairman, and 21st Century Fox, where he is co-executive chairman, running the corporation with his two sons, Lachlan and James.

As such, Murdoch is a dominant force over newspapers, publishers and TV networks in the English-language media, encompassing BSkyB, The Times and The Sun in the UK; the FOX cable network including FOX News, Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, New York Post and National Geographic in the US; The Australian, The Daily Telegraph, and Herald Sun in Australia — to name just a few.

"I believe Genie Energy's technologies and vast shale oil licenses have real potential to spur a global, geo-political paradigm shift by moving a major portion of new oil production to America, Israel, and other western-oriented democracies," said Murdoch explaining his reasons for investing in the firm.

During the Leveson inquiry, it emerged that the global media baron had numerous undisclosed meetings with Prime Minister David Cameron, who appeared to have close relationships with Murdoch and other senior News Corp. officials.

Murdoch and Rothschild also serve on Genie's strategic advisory board. Joining them on the board are Larry Summers, former Director of President Obama's National Economic Council; ex-CIA Director James Woolsey, a former Vice-President of NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, Director of the neoconservative Foundation for Defense of Democracies, advisory board member of anti-Muslim hate group the Gatestone Institute, international patron to the Henry Jackson Society; Dick Cheney, former Vice-President under George W. Bush; and Bill Richardson, former Secretary of Energy under Clinton, Governor of New Mexico and Obama nominee for Secretary of Commerce.

Dismembering Syria to stave-off peak oil

Another of Genie Oil and Gas's subsidiaries is American Shale Oil, a joint project with the French major Total SA. Total was among the sponsors of the 2010 international oil and gas exhibition hosted by the Assad regime in Damascus.

American Shale Oil (AMSO) operates in the US in Colorado's Green River Formation, estimated to hold 3 trillion barrels of recoverable oil.

On its website, the company offers an extraordinary declaration regarding its rationale for focusing on unconventional oil and gas resources in the US and Israel:The Rise of the "Good Enough" Cryptocurrency

Anecdotal Observations on New Money in Crypto

It seems that new entrants to the cryptocurrency space are buying cryptos for the lotto ticket (yes, some people straight up called them lotto tickets buys) without regard to technical merit or decentralization.

For example, ripple has experienced a tremendous short term gain.

The entrants that I've spoke with prefer cryptocurrencies with the lowest fees and fastest transactions(read: UX), with decentralization, security, and technical merit taking a back seat. This gives rise to an interesting trend: the rise of the "good enough" cryptocurrency.

From my conversations with over 100+ new entrants, it seems that the primary "good enough " cryptocurrency features are low tx fees and low entrance price (market cap is disregarded). The low entrance price factor is likely due to the human preference for whole numbers. When using currency, the new entrants find it befuddling to use .002 BTC or .01 ETH, preferring to use 100 XRP or 20000 XRB instead. While some entrants understand that this is a cosmetic difference as BTC and ETH can be transacted in satoshi or wei instead, the vast majority of the ecosystem still uses full BTC or ETH units. To new entrants, this is confusing and unnatural, as converting fiat to crypto is hard enough, now the entrants have to convert using decimals. This cuts against adoption, as the UX is not new-entrant friendly.

Same with the tx fees. Many new entrants want to move their crypto to their own addresses, either through mobile, desktop, or hardware wallets. But none of them want to pay the $25 BTC fee. Some of the new entrants even balk at the $.04 ETH fee, instead opting for fee-less cryptocurrencies such as XRP, XRB, and IOTA. These entrants buy these cryptocurrencies and get their coins stuck in the backlogs, with many opting to leave the cryptocurrencies on exchange. Still, they purchased the coins and contribute to the demand and price appreciation.

I still believe that the root cause of this effect is misinformation and a steep learning curve of what makes a cryptocurrency useful (not a censor-able centralized crypto like XRP, which is like buying paypal tokens when businesses just use the paypal platform without paypal tokens). However, there will be a rise in the good enough cryptocurrencies, at least in the short term, where new entrants want the cheapest fees, lowest entrance cost, and best UX. It seems the other factors that comprise technical merit for a given cryptocurrency is given low priority.

Censorship, decentralization, security? Who cares, this is good enough.Tinder Experiments II: Guys, unless you are really hot you are probably better off not wasting your time on Tinder — a quantitative socio-economic study worst-online-dater Follow Mar 25, 2015 · 8 min read

by Worst-Online-Dater

Abstract (TL;DR)

This study was conducted to quantify the Tinder socio-economic prospects for males based on the percentage of females that will "like" them. Female Tinder usage data was collected and statistically analyzed to determine the inequality in the Tinder economy. It was determined that the bottom 80% of men (in terms of attractiveness) are competing for the bottom 22% of women and the top 78% of women are competing for the top 20% of men. The Gini coefficient for the Tinder economy based on "like" percentages was calculated to be 0.58. This means that the Tinder economy has more inequality than 95.1% of all the world's national economies. In addition, it was determined that a man of average attractiveness would be "liked" by approximately 0.87% (1 in 115) of women on Tinder. Also, a formula was derived to estimate a man's attractiveness level based on the percentage of "likes" he receives on Tinder:

attractiveness%=16.8*ln(like%)+52.3

Introduction

In my previous post we learned that in Tinder there is a big difference in the number of "likes" an attractive guy receives versus an unattractive guy (duh). I wanted to understand this trend in more quantitative terms (also, I like pretty graphs). To do this, I decided to treat Tinder as an economy and study it as an economist (socio-economist) would. Since I wasn't getting any hot Tinder dates I had plenty of time to do the math (so you don't have to).

The Tinder Economy

First, let's define the Tinder economy. The wealth of an economy is quantified in terms its currency. In most of the world the currency is money (or goats). In Tinder the currency is "likes". The more "likes" you get the more wealth you have in the Tinder ecosystem.

Wealth in Tinder is not distributed equally. Attractive guys have more wealth in the Tinder economy (get more "likes") than unattractive guys do. This isn't surprising since a large portion of the ecosystem is based on physical appearance. An unequal wealth distribution is to be expected, but there is a more interesting question: What is the degree of this unequal wealth distribution and how does this inequality compare to other economies? To answer that question we are first going to need some data (and a nerd to analyze it).

Tinder doesn't supply any statistics or analytics about member usage so I had to collect this data myself. The most important data I needed was the percent of men that these females tended to "like". I collected this data by interviewing females who had "liked" a fake Tinder profile I set up. I asked them each several questions about their Tinder usage while they thought they were talking to an attractive male who was interested in them. Lying in this way is ethically questionable at best (and highly entertaining), but, unfortunately I had no other way to get the required data.

Caveats (skip this section if you just want to see the results)

At this point I would be remiss to not mention a few caveats about these data. First, the sample size is small (only 27 females were interviewed). Second, all data is self reported. The females who responded to my questions could have lied about the percentage of guys they "like" in order to impress me (fake super hot Tinder me) or make themselves seem more selective. This self reporting bias will definitely introduce error into the analysis, but there is evidence to suggest the data I collected have some validity. For instance, a recent New York Times article stated that in an experiment females on average swiped a 14% "like" rate. This compares vary favorably with the data I collected that shows a 12% average "like" rate.

Additionally, I am only accounting for the percentage of "likes" and not the actual men they "like". I have to assume that in general females find the same men attractive. I think this is the biggest flaw in this analysis, but currently there is no other way to analyze the data. There are also two reasons to believe that useful trends can be determined from these data even with this flaw. First, in my previous post we saw that attractive men did equally as well across all female age groups, independent of the age of the male, so to some extent all women have similar tastes in terms of physical attractiveness. Second, most women can agree if a guy is really attractive or really unattractive. Women are more likely to disagree on the attractiveness of men in the middle of the economy. As we will see, the "wealth" in the middle and bottom portion of the Tinder economy is lower than the "wealth" of the "wealthiest" (in terms of "likes"). Therefore, even if the error introduced by this flaw is significant it shouldn't greatly affect the overall trend.

Ok, enough talk. (Stop — Data time)

The Data

As I stated previously the average female "likes" 12% of men on Tinder. This doesn't mean though that most males will get "liked" back by 12% of all the women they "like" on Tinder. This would only be the case if "likes" were equally distributed. In reality, the bottom 80% of men are fighting over the bottom 22% of women and the top 78% of women are fighting over the top 20% of men. We can see this trend in Figure 1. The area in blue represents the situations where women are more likely to "like" the men. The area in pink represents the situations where men are more likely to "like" women. The curve doesn't go down linearly, but instead drops quickly after the top 20% of men. Comparing the blue area and the pink area we can see that for a random female/male Tinder interaction the male is likely to "like" the female 6.2 times more often than the female "likes" the male.

Figure 1.

We can also see that the wealth distribution for males in the Tinder economy is quite large. Most females only "like" the most attractive guys. So how can we compare the Tinder economy to other economies? Economists use two main metrics to compare the wealth distribution of economies: The Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient.

The Lorenz curve (Wikipedia link) is a graph showing the proportion of overall income or wealth assumed by the bottom x% of the people. If the wealth was equally distributed the graph would show a 45 degree line. The amount the curve bends below the 45 degree line shows the extent of wealth inequality. Figure 2 shows the Lorenz curve for the Tinder economy compared to the curve for the U.S. income distribution from a few years ago.

Figure 2.

The Lorenz curve for the Tinder economy is lower than the curve for the US economy. This means that the inequality in Tinder wealth distribution is larger than the inequality of income in the US economy. One way economists quantify this difference is by comparing the Gini coefficient for different economies.

The Gini coefficient (Wikipedia link) is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds with perfect equality where everyone has the same income (damn commies) and 1 corresponds with perfect inequality where one person has all the income and everyone else has zero income (let them eat cake). The United States currently has one of the higher Gini coefficients (most income inequality) of all of the world's biggest economies at a value of 0.41. The Tinder Gini coefficient is even higher at 0.58. This may not seem like a big difference but it is actually huge. Figure 3 compares the income Gini coefficient distribution for 162 nations and adds the Tinder economy to the list. The United States Gini coefficient is higher than 62% of the world's countries. The Tinder economy has a higher Gini coefficient than 95.1% of the countries in the world. The only countries that have a higher Gini coefficient than Tinder are Angola, Haiti, Botswana, Namibia, Comoros, South Africa, Equatorial Guinea, and Seychelles (which I had never heard of before).

Figure 3.

What it all means

From this data (and some data collected for the previous post) we can make an estimate as to the percentage of females on Tinder that are likely to "like" a male based on his attractiveness. This graph is shown as Figure 4. Note that the y-axis is in log scale and the curve is fairly linear. This means the curve has a high correlation to an exponential fit. Therefore, you can gauge your attractiveness level if you "like" all girls and keep track of the percentage of girls that "like" you back with a simple equation:

attractiveness%=16.8*ln(like%)+52.3

Figure 4.

According to my last post, the most attractive men will be liked by only approximately 20% of all the females on Tinder. This number is low due to a combination of factors including females that don't regularly use the site, fake profiles, intimidation, and some variation in what the pickiest women find attractive. In the grand scheme of things, a 20% success rate can actually lead to a large number of matches very quickly. So attractive guys can do pretty well using Tinder (congratulations).

Unfortunately, this percentage decreases rapidly as you go down the attractiveness scale. According to this analysis a man of average attractiveness can only expect to be liked by slightly less than 1% of females (0.87%). This equates to 1 "like" for every 115 females. The good news is that if you are only getting liked by a few girls on Tinder you shouldn't take it personally. You aren't necessarily unattractive. You can be of above average attractiveness and still only get liked by a few percent of women on Tinder. The bad news is that if you aren't in the very upper echelons of Tinder wealth (i.e. attractiveness) you aren't likely to have much success using Tinder. You would probably be better off just going to a bar or joining some coed recreational sports team.

On the other hand, it doesn't take much effort to swipe right... (So you are saying I have a 1 in 115 chance?)If a pig came and nuzzled you like a puppy, would you be able to kill it just moments later?

This is one of the scenarios faced by slaughterhouse workers on a daily basis. They see animals that are, in many ways, no different to those we welcome into our homes as family members.

They then have to kill them. Hundreds, sometimes thousands of them a day.

The psychological toll this takes on a person cannot be underestimated. Slaughterhouse work has been linked to a variety of disorders, including PTSD and the lesser-known PITS (perpetration-induced traumatic stress). It has also been connected to an increase in crime rates, including higher incidents of domestic abuse, as well as alcohol and drug abuse.

And as the already huge demand for meat goes up, so too does the number of animals employees are required to kill on a daily basis.

Yet among the general population, surprisingly little is known about the price these often low-wage workers pay so that others can enjoy meat in relative oblivion.

Dr Chi-Chi Obuaya, a consultant psychiatrist at Nightingale mental health hospital in London, told Metro.co.uk that we tend to think of PTSD as arising from a specific traumatic incident, usually among people who have had something inflicted upon them. As perpetrators of the violence, however, slaughterhouse workers experience something quite different.

'We normally think about PTSD and trauma responses where someone has either been the victim, or they've witnessed something,' he explained. 'So someone who's been subjected to torture, somebody whose life has been threatened or has been in an area of conflict, and it's arising in that situation. Another group would be people who've witnessed very traumatic things.'

For slaughterhouse workers, the trauma isn't confined to one incident. Slaughterers will kill hundreds of animals every day – and they are the perpetrators.

Dr Obuaya likened the work to child soldiers, forced into a conflict situation in which they have to commit horrific acts of violence. Another analogous situation he described was that of a bus driver, who has to witness people taking their own lives in front of their vehicle – 'even though they're not perpetrators, they're witnesses to it'.

Vaping is 'just as bad for the heart as traditional smoking'

'Clearly, this sort of [slaughterhouse] work is pretty brutal, and therefore there are two ways of looking at it,' he said. 'We normally think about PTSD in relation to very discrete episodes of trauma. So there will be an event which has occurred on a particular day, and there's the onset of symptoms following that, such as nightmares and flashbacks, which arise in the weeks and months following a trauma. So that's how we tend to diagnose [PTSD] using our diagnostic manuals.

'One of the things that is less well understood – and this is where this group, slaughterhouse workers, falls into – is repetitive trauma, and how that's conceptualised. The understanding in psychiatric literature is still fairly limited, because we tend to model it around very discrete episodes.

'So I would look at other groups for comparison – so someone who's been entrapped and held captive against their will, may or may not be subjected to specific incidents of a life-threatening nature, but over a period of time there's that repetitive trauma. I don't want to use the word "low-grade" – it's not quite as dramatic, but it's very pervasive. This kind of work falls into that category.'

Workers each have to kill hundreds, sometimes thousands of animals a day (Picture: Getty Images)

Although limited, the studies that are out there have found a very clear link between working in slaughterhouses and traumatic disorders – including the less well-known PITS.

Rachel M. Macnair, a sociologist and psychologist, describes the disorder in her 2002 work Perpetration-Induced Traumatic Stress: The Psychological Consequences of Killing as a form of PTSD that arises 'from situations that would be traumatic if someone were a victim, but situations for which the person in question was a causal participant' – that is, where the sufferer has those symptoms because he or she created the traumatic situation. According to Macnair, PITS can lead to anxiety, panic, depression, drug and alcohol abuse, increased paranoia, a sense of disintegration, dissociation and amnesia. These, she writes, are part of the 'psychological consequences' of killing.

Macnair was mainly talking about PITS in relation to executioners, combat veterans, and Nazis in World War II – although she does say that slaughterhouse workers are another section of society that is likely to be vulnerable.

Dr Obuaya agreed, adding: 'There is almost a variation of PTSD which we refer to as complex PTSD, and it was described more in survivors of childhood abuse – physical, psychological, emotional – where there's a repetitive trauma. It's a little bit different to PTSD. With PTSD, you have a cluster of symptoms: reliving the event, avoiding reminders of the event, and what we call hyper-vigilance – so a feeling that one needs to be on one's guard, and the autonomic nervous system goes into overdrive, so it causes autonomic hyper-arousal.

'Whereas with complex PTSD there may or may not be some of those "reliving" experiences, and there's a sort of self-loathing that tends to emerge – a very strong dislike of oneself, and loss of one's identity. That's what one would see in this particular group, where the repetitive nature of the exposure to the trauma as a perpetrator then leads to this breakdown in the individual's identity. Now, it's not fully recognised in the diagnostic manuals, but it is something that we refer to in clinical practice, and there are treatments that can be geared towards that.'

He added: 'I guess anyone that's experiencing mental health difficulties, there will tend to be a tendency to look at what their personality was like pretty morbidly, so someone becomes very depressed, one can usually distinguish between a period when they might have been very outgoing and gregarious, and then they become very withdrawn. There's that change in their personality both subjectively in how they would describe it, and also for people close to them who have known them for a long period of time, objectively there's also a change – so it may come across as irritability, distrust, anger directed both towards themselves and other people. So there's a change in the personality that's sometimes difficult to fully articulate. But there's an understanding that something has shifted.'

Former slaughterhouse workers who have since spoken out about their time in the industry have described feeling this change within them, and experiencing PTSD symptoms for years afterwards.

One hog sticker, Ed Van Winkle, was quoted in the minutes of Tyson Foods Annual Shareholder Meeting in 2006 describing the work the dissociation slaughterers had to force upon themselves. He worked at Morrell slaughterhouse in Sioux City, in the US state of Iowa.

'The worst thing, worse than the physical danger [of on-the-job accidents] is the emotional toll,' Winkle said. 'Pigs down on the kill floor have come up and nuzzled me like a puppy. Two minutes later I had to kill them – beat them to death with a pipe. I can't care.'

'Pigs down on the kill floor have come up and nuzzled me like a puppy' (Picture: Getty Images)

Another such man was Virgil Butler, who worked in a poultry plant in the US, run by the American firm Tyson, from 1997 until 2002. After leaving, he worked as an anti-slaughter activist, working to set up a sanctuary for rescued animals with his partner Laura Alexander.

'The sheer amount of killing and blood can really get to you after a while,' he wrote on his blog The Cyberactivist in 2003. 'Especially if you can't just shut down all emotion and turn into a robot zombie of death. You feel like part of a big death machine. [You're] pretty much treated that way as well.

'Sometimes weird thoughts will enter your head. It's just you and the dying chickens. The surreal feelings grow into such a horror of the barbaric nature of your behaviour. You are murdering helpless birds by the thousands (75,000 to 90,000 a night). You are a killer.'

Describing the isolation he and his colleagues faced, Butler wrote about 'the guy they hauled off to the mental hospital that kept having nightmares that chickens were after him', before adding: 'I've had those, too.'

But tragically, people end up trapped in this line of work. Butler explained in a speech, 'Inside Tyson's Hell', how most of his colleagues were illiterate, unable even to fill in the job application forms by themselves. Their prospects of getting work elsewhere were next to nothing.

Stuck in such a life, Butler described how it would make them 'more prone to violence', and 'much more likely to physically attack whatever or whoever you are mad at' – and described in detail some of the 'games' workers would play with the carcasses of dead animals.

Children without any brothers or sisters are more likely to be fat

In one such game, slaughterers would apparently rip the heads off live chickens, place the heads on their fingers and use them as puppets. In another, they would start so-called 'shit fights', where they would squeeze a live chicken so violently that its faeces would squirt out onto another person.

'Many people who do this commit violent acts,' he wrote. 'They commit crimes. People who already are criminals tend to gravitate towards this job. You can't have a strong conscience and kill living creatures night after night.

'You feel isolated from society, not a part of it. Alone. You know you are different from most people. They don't have visions of horrible death in their heads. They have not seen what you have seen. And they don't want to. They don't even want to hear about it.'

Butler tragically passed away in his sleep just a few years later, in December 2006.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

.:Sam / INFP:. I do things, I guess. I make art and music relating to whatever I'm obsessed with at the time.The late Hamda Zubeidat, who died in an occupied village north of Jericho of a heart attack when Israeli soldiers hurled stun grenades at her house on December 12 after midnight.

JERICHO — The events that transpired on the night of December 12 were nothing short of a complete shock to the Palestinian residents of the village of al-Zubeidat, located just off a main road in the Jordan Valley area of the central occupied West Bank.

At around 8 pm, dozens of Israeli soldiers and military jeeps raided the village in full force, allegedly in search of young men who had been throwing rocks at Israeli settlers who share the main road with Palestinians.

"They were showering the village with stun grenades," Tawfiq Zubeidat, 40, told Mondoweiss, "indiscriminately, without any care or concern."

About an hour into the raid, around 9 pm, soldiers arrived to Tawfiq's family compound in the northern area of the village where his mother Hamda, in her late 70's, was trying to fall asleep despite the frightening sounds of the raid on the other end of al-Zubeidat.

"They fired one grenade right here," Hamda's grandson Mahmoud, 28, said, pointing to a side entrance to Hamda's home, just feet away from where she was trying to sleep.

It was the loud bang of that stun grenade that startled an already-frightened Hamda, and triggered a heart attack in the mother of 12.

Despite the efforts of her sons, and frantic Israeli soldiers who called in for army ambulances to treat Hamda, the beloved matriarch of more than 100 children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren died on the way to the nearest hospital in Jericho city, 45 km away.

"We are in total disbelief," Tawfiq said, sitting in the family's courtyard among three of his eight brothers, who echoed similar sentiments.

Even more shocking than her sudden death is perhaps the fact that for the 1,500 Palestinians in al-Zubeidat, Hamda, a matriarch to four living generations, was their first shahida, or martyr — something practically unheard of across Palestine.

A quiet village in disbelief

The village of al-Zubeidat came to being in the aftermath of the Nakba, or catastrophe, in 1948 when more than 700,000 Palestinians were made refugees with the creation of the state of Israel.

The Zubeidat tribe were some of those refugees, native to what is present day Beer Sheva in the Negev desert of southern Israel. After they were expelled from their lands, they settled in the Jordan Valley, and have built a quiet life for their descendants living in the village.

As of a result of the 1995 Oslo Accords, al-Zubeidat was divided into Areas 'B' and 'C.' Approximately 36 dunums (1% of the total village area) were classified as Area B, where the Palestinian Authority (PA) has control over civil matters but Israel maintains security control, according to the Applied Research Institute – Jerusalem (ARIJ).

Meanwhile, 99% of the village, mostly open agricultural lands, was classified as Area C — meaning Israel maintains complete civilian and control in the area.

Typical to the hundreds of Palestinian villages and towns in Area C, which makes up more than 60% of the occupied West Bank, there is a history of land confiscation for settlements and roads, stop-work orders and home demolitions in the village.

Additionally, given that the village is located in the heart of the Jordan Valley, where around 57% of the land has been designated as "closed military" or "firing zones," the residents of al-Zubeidat are no strangers to Israeli military training activities that take place in the areas around the village.

Despite fitting the profile of almost every Palestinian village in the occupied territory, Hamda Zubeidat's sons insisted that their lives were relatively normal and quiet.

"Many of the people in the village are well educated. We are teachers, lawyers, doctors, and students," Tawfiq told Mondoweiss, adding that many in the village also work as farmers on the nearby date farms.

"We live a simple life," Tawfiq said, "that's all our mother wanted for us, was to get an education and take care of our families."

"Yes, the occupation affects us, as it does to every Palestinian. Soldiers raid the village from time to time and conduct training activities in the surrounding areas, but nothing out of the ordinary," Tawfiq's older brother Fayez said.

It was clear, from Hamda's sons, grandsons, and great grandsons sitting in the courtyard outside where she died just one week earlier: what happened on December 12 was not normal.

'They use our homes like a playground'

About a dozen of Hamda's immediate family members had gathered outside her home, each one voicing their opinion on what part of the raid that night did not add up.

"Typically when soldiers raid the village, just a few of them come, maybe one jeep, two maximum," one of Hamda's son said.

"They will come and knock on our doors, ask us for our IDs, and move on," another said.

"The way they came that night, dozens of soldiers, firing tear gas and sound bombs everywhere — they weren't looking for stone throwers as they said," Tawfiq told Mondoweiss, "they were conducting some sort of training activity."

Tawfiq's brothers, nephews, and cousins nodded in agreement. The day of the raid, they said, there were not even any clashes or stone throwing going on on the main road, leading all of them to believe that the village was being used as a training ground for new soldiers who were learning the trade of night raids on Palestinian towns and villages.

The Israeli army referred my calls on the case to the Israeli police. They have not returned my calls.

"They came here and fired so many sound bombs, as if our homes were their playground," Tawfiq told Mondoweiss. When asked to describe the sound, his brother Fayez jumped in.

"My house is 500 meters away from here," he said, "but those sound grenades are so loud that when they fired the one at my mom's house, it was so loud I thought it was at my front door."

"When they were here firing bombs and gas like it was a game, they weren't thinking that we are real people living here. That we have kids and elderly people like my mother that will be scared," Tawfiq said, "I'm sure this didn't even cross their minds. And we lost our dear mother because of their carelessness."

[Editor's note: Ma'an reported at the time that Hamda Zubeidat was 60. Her sons corrected her age, to late 70s.]As of Monday, the New York Daily News won't have an editor in chief or a publisher.

Arthur Browne, the veteran editor who has been juggling both jobs, is retiring on December 31. The paper's new owner, Tronc, knew about his impending retirement when it bought the paper in September -- but hasn't hired a replacement.

So the storied New York City tabloid will operate without official leadership for the time being.

When CNN contacted him on Friday, Browne confirmed that his successor has yet to be named. "The office will be broom clean when she or he arrives," he said.

Publishers sometimes name an interim editor, but not in this case.

"We are in the midst of a search for the next editor in chief of the New York Daily News and expect to make an announcement in the next few weeks," a Tronc spokeswoman told CNN.

The company declined to say whether there is also an ongoing search for a new publisher.

Major newspapers have historically had separate editors and publishers, with the editor running the newsroom side and the publisher overseeing the business side. But in most of its markets, Tronc (previously known as Tribune) has merged the editor and publisher jobs.

(Earlier this year, however, Tronc again split the two jobs when it replaced the editor-publisher of the Los Angeles Times.)

Browne, a longtime deputy editor at the Daily News, was named editor in chief back in October 2016, when Mortimer B. Zuckerman still owned the paper. When Zuckerman decided to sell in September 2017, Tronc added publisher responsibilities to Browne's plate.

But Browne had previously told Zuckerman that he planned to retire by mid-2018. When Tronc took over, he agreed to stay until the end of 2017, giving the new owner about four months to find a successor.

Tronc was not exactly embraced by Daily News staffers. The publisher has been criticized for deep cost cuts at papers like Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times. Its digital strategy, full of false starts and do-overs, has been derided by analysts and onlookers. There was fresh criticism this month when an SEC filing revealed that Tronc chairman Michael Ferro is being paid $5 million per year for the next three years.

So as Browne's retirement date neared, colleagues started to wonder aloud -- what's Tronc going to do? Who's going to run the paper?

It's become something of a mystery.

"I've never heard of a paper functioning without at least an acting editor in chief for any period of time," Browne's predecessor Jim Rich told CNN. "At a moment where local coverage is teetering on the brink of extinction, it's depressing to think that this is the state of affairs at what was once a stalwart of local journalism."

Rich is working on launching a nonprofit local news site for the New York area.

Browne told CNN he does not have another job lined up.

"This former copy boy plans to join my colleagues on New Year's Eve to witness the brilliant construction of my last Daily News front page," Browne said. "I am departing from the Daily News because after almost 44 years it's time to find new interesting, fun, rewarding ways to spend my time. I am exploring several very different paths so at this point: Who knows?"

In a statement, Tronc celebrated Browne's tenure at the newspaper.

"A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Arthur has served as editor in chief, editorial page editor and led a team that won a Pulitzer for Ground Zero illnesses in 2007. He has led the newsroom through a time of rapid change and we are grateful," the company said.Almost three years have passed since Saudi Arabia announced it was intervening militarily, with its allies, in Yemen, to remove the Houthis (officially called Ansar Allah) from power after they had taken over the capital. Western analysts saw it as a bold move from recently-empowered (deputy) crown prince Mohammad bin Salman (MbS), weapons manufacturers and their political representatives were delighted. But what had been predicted as a swift military operation has turned into a humiliating stalemate. Unable to impose its will by force, Saudi Arabia and its bold prince have resorted to war crimes and collective punishment, imposing a humanitarian catastrophe on the Yemeni people.

The lack of media interest makes it seem like a crisis unfolding in slow motion. But that is only because outrage and compassion are now meant to be weaponised when they can be useful in justifying imperialist interventions. For the Yemeni people the agony is real and there is no escaping it. In what was already the poorest country in the region, the Saudi-led bombings of infrastructure and the blockade imposed on Yemeni ports have left millions on the brink.

According to UN estimates, 17 million Yemenis, more than 60% of the population, are in urgent need of food. Out of these, 7 million are facing famine. The destruction of infrastructure has also left 15 million without any access to healthcare and generated an unprecedented cholera outbreak, with 900.000 cases and thousands dead already. 50.000 Yemeni children have died in 2017 as a result of disease and starvation. There is no hyperbole needed, this is a humanitarian disaster that is beyond words. Only it is not a natural catastrophe. More than something that is being allowed to happen, it is something that is being deliberately imposed on the Yemeni people.

Western outrage and responsibility

As the Syrian army moved to re-take eastern Aleppo, a monumental PR campaign saw people who had never bothered before rise up from their Starbucks couches to proclaim that humanity had lost its ways. One day, hopefully, people will wonder how large swaths of western public opinion were manipulated into working in a propaganda stunt to defend a city held by al-Qaida (1). Months earlier we were bombarded by the media about the siege of Madaya, where 40.000 people were being starved to death (2). Yet now, with an entire country on the brink of famine, the media silence is telling.

Anyone can voice their horror at a hospital being bombed in Syria. The issue here is not one of comparing tragedies and demanding proportional levels of outrage. The issue is that the West is directly responsible for the tragedy in Yemen. Western companies supply the weapons, western military advisors are involved in the intelligence work and the selection of targets, US airplanes are refuellingSaudi (and coalition) jets as they carry out their savage bombings in Yemen. The supposed outrage is not connected to any concern for human rights, it is merely a foreign policy propaganda trick. And the main priority for people in the west should be to stop the crimes being committed, or abetted, by their owngovernments.

There is no point in invoking this or that convention, because all western governments and weapons manufacturers will claim that they do not sell weapons if they end up being used to commit human rights violations. But there is overwhelming evidence that war crimes are being committed left and right, from double-tap strikes to bombings of hospitals, schools, or even funerals, and nobody has suggested putting the brakes on this money train of weapons sales. Evidence of war crimes will be either ignored or, as British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson suggested, left to the Saudis themselves to investigate!

Some media outlets could even be mistaken for Saudi propaganda pieces. The media coverage of MbS is nothing less than fawning in outlets such as the Guardian, not to mention the ineffable Thomas Friedman. And Saudi officials always get to voice their positions and denials through western outlets. One recurring example has a Saudi official denying that a given airstrike has been carried out by the Saudis, and the western media are happy to publish this without reminding their readers that nobody else is flying over Yemen. It is as if wayward bombs just wander into Yemen.

Even the United Nations has all but sidestepped its responsibilities. Its role is reduced to calling on Saudi Arabia to stop blocking the ports of a foreign country. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, a western puppet par excellence, is his latest report, mentions the horrific suffering in Yemen. But while the usual suspects (North Korea, Venezuela, Iran, etc) had all sorts of claims – real, exaggerated or fabricated – amplified in the report, Saudi Arabia is not even named as responsible for this situation, only "coalition airstrikes" are mentioned.

War, what is it good for?

Articles no longer wonder what this war is even about, and why it continues. Impunity on the global stage usually comes hand in hand with indifference in the media. For one, beyond the lucrative weapons dealing, it is a matter of letting the Saudis do what they want. With trillions of dollars looming large in the near future with major privatisation plans in motion, including of Saudi Aramco, letting millions of unworthy victims die in Yemen is a small price to pay. The Saudi crown prince can throw a tantrum, launch a deadly war and kill millions in the process and get away with it because he is sitting on a giant pile of money.

The "Iran is behind it" angle is not very convincing for anyone who can look at a map. Given that the Saudis and local allies control the gulf of Aden, Iranian ships laden with weapons cannot exactly waltz all the way to northern Yemen and Sanaa. The same applies to the airspace, which is entirely controlled by the Saudis. So while Iran may have managed to send some support and advisors, it is laughable to describe the Houthis as Iranian-controlled or even Iranian-backed. But as is often the case, bogeymen tend to have fantastical properties.

In the beginning of the war we often heard that the war was about restoring Yemen's legitimate, democratically-elected government. Dozens of journalists wrote that the backward kingdom of Saudi Arabia was launching a war to restore democracy without sensing that something was off. The articles usually mentioned that Yemen was emerging from decades of dictatorship under Ali Abdullah Saleh. Saleh had ruled Yemen with an iron fist, and had been a useful ally both for Saudi Arabia and the US, which has been drone-bombing everything in the vicinity of a cellphone that once belonged to an alleged terror suspect (3).

When massive protests starting in 2011 forced Saleh out, the US and the Saudis scrambled to salvage the situation. In the end they managed to get all parties, including the Houthis, to agree to a political transition. This included an election in which Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi ran as the only candidate. So he is the legitimate president to be restored, but the media never mention that he had been vice-dictator for 20 years. One election with no other candidates and voilà, you get all the stamps you need from the western press.

What the articles also forget to mention is that Hadi's term was supposed to finish in late 2014, and it was only after he did not deliver on political and economic measures that the Houthis seized power. Now, after almost three years of a Saudi war imposing death and misery on the Yemeni people on his behalf, who can refer to Hadi as being internationally recognised? What is that recognition even worth? And to add insult to injury, it seems Hadi is now allegedly under house arrest.

The Saudis latest gamble involved getting their former friend Saleh to turn against the Houthis (4). Given their long history of oppression at the hands of Saleh and the fact that there had been previous armed uprisings, this alliance was always going to be fragile. Saleh thought there was an opening, and Saudi air cover, for him to make a move and restore normal subservience to the northern neighbour. But the move backfired, Saleh ended up killed and, according to reports, the Houthis regained full control of the capital. Otherwise the media rehabilitation of Saleh as the man who restored Yemeni democracy would be in full-swing by now.

In summary, an entitled royal with a short temper and a large arsenal plunged himself into an endless war because Saudi Arabia, with its very fragile legitimacy, cannot tolerate an insubordinate neighbour. But it takes more than weapons, and the Saudis have lots of them, to subjugate a people. Only those who are too short-sighted or too eager to push the Iran angle cannot see that not only are the Houthis a Yemeni movement with ample support on the ground, they have also proven themselves a mighty opponent on their home turf.

The war has turned into a conflict that the Saudis cannot win, but still there is no end in sight. The Saudis are willing to let millions die because they can do so with impunity. And their western sponsors are also happy to let this genocide carry on. Because although it might cause some PR problems, it is, both in the short and long run, great for business, and at the end of the day that is what western foreign policy has always been about.

Notes

(1) For all the proclamations that the West is committed to fighting terrorism, with Saudi Arabia as their main ally (believe it or not), the reality on the ground tells a different story. Saudi-led troops have been happy to collude and even fight alongside al-Qaida on the battlefield. Terrorism can be a threat or, more usually, an asset to advance Western interests.

(2) This would be a matter for another essay, but Eva Bartlett has actually visited these places after they were re-taken by the Syrian army and found that the locals tell a story that differs significantly from the narrative of civilians deliberately starved by brutal regime while brave moderate rebels resisted.

(3) US intelligence agencies track their targets from their cellphone signals. With other people nearby, or the simple possibility of giving the cellphone to someone else, a high number of civilian casualties is to be expected. And this without going into the whole issue of US agencies deciding in secret who gets to live or die thousands of miles away.

(4) It is worth mentioning that both Saleh and the Houthis are from the (Shia) Zaydi branch of Islam. So much for the Orientalist assertion that these deeply-rooted economic and political grievances are at heart a dispute about the succession of the Prophet Muhammad...January 3rd, 2018 will mark a special stardate in Star Trek history; the 25th anniversary of the premiere of the second live-action Star Trek spinoff series, "Deep Space Nine"...

I still remember the premiere of "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine," on January 3, 1993. I was living in my tiny bachelor apartment at the time (this was about 4 and a half years before I met my future missus). It was a cool January night (for California), and I was huddled in front of my little 20" Sony Trinitron TV (which lasted just over 22 years before my wife and I gave it to charity). I'd put a fresh premium quality VHS tape into the VCR (nothing but the best to record a new Star Trek), and I was all set to live-tape the premiere (pause-editing all of the commercials, of course).

Deep Space Nine's premiere, "Emissary" came on with a bang...almost literally.

The opening of DS9 flashes back to the the battle of Wolf 359, three years earlier in Star Trek chronology (we never actually got to see that infamous battle in the Next Generation two-parter "Best of Both Worlds"; only the aftermath). Capt. Jean-Luc Picard, temporarily converted into the Borg "Locutus," demands the surrender of the USS Saratoga.

On the bridge of that ship, we see a Vulcan captain (played by future Klingon general "Martok" actor, J.G. Hertzler) and his first officer, Commander Benjamin Sisko (DS9 series' star, Avery Brooks). The battle does not go well; the Saratoga is mortally wounded, and the order is given to abandon ship. In the ensuing chaos, Sisko manages to find his son Jake (apparently families are common on most Federation ships at this point, not just the Enterprise-D) and the bloodied, pinned corpse of his wife, Jennifer. With the aid of a Bolian crew member, a grief-stricken Sisko and his son manage to get into a crowded escape pod and flee the destruction of the Saratoga.

Cut to three years later; Sisko and his son Jake are aboard another Federation starship en route to take command of a recently abandoned mining station (rechristened Deep Space Nine) in orbit of the recently liberated planet Bajor.

Sisko's orders come (of course) from Capt. Picard; the man whom Sisko unfairly blames for the loss of his wife and his old ship. Upon meeting Picard, Sisko makes it clear he still holds bitterness towards the captain. Picard tells him he will consider looking for a replacement, which Sisko agrees is a good idea. But Sisko tells Picard that until he can find a way out of the assignment, he will carry out his duties on the station.

Aboard Deep Space Nine, Sisko meets some of his staff; chief engineer Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney, transferring over from Next Generation), as well as...

...fiery-tempered Bajoran first officer Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor, throwing herself into the role with appropriate piss and vinegar).

Sisko also meets his grumpy shapeshifting security chief Odo (Rene Auberjonois) and a Ferengi saloon keeper named Quark (Armin Shimerman). Immediately we see that Odo and Quark have a quarry/prey frenemy vibe not too dissimilar from the verbal sparring of Spock and McCoy in the original series (but with a pinch more salt).

Later, we see the arrival of two new Starfleet characters; young, brash doctor Julian Bashir (played with a Clark Kent-like stammer by Alexander Siddig, who was previously credited as Siddig El-Fadil) and science officer Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell), who is a member of a joined symbiotic species called the Trill. Jadzia's supermodel body is actually the latest 'host' of Sisko's longtime friend and mentor Curzon Dax; whose Dax 'symbiont' now resides inside of her (!). It takes Sisko a moment to get used to his old mentor's new, 28 year old female appearance; and he affectionately refers to Jadzia as "old man."

The plot is a bit loose at this point, allowing some space for character exposition. The crew are to recover and analyze mysterious orbs ("tears of the prophets") left behind by the Bajoran gods ("the prophets") who reside in a mythical 'celestial temple' somewhere within the Bajoran star system. These orbs, one of which Sisko finds on Bajor with the aid of the planet's spiritual leader Kai Opaka (Camille Saviola), is brought back to the station for analysis. Opaka 'reads' Sisko's "pah" (his soul) by touching his ear. She predicts he will be "the emissary" foretold to Bajor in their scriptures; the one who will find the celestial temple.

Turns out the Cardassians, led by former head of the occupation Gul Dukat (Marc Alaimo) want this newfound orb as well. The Cardassians plundered both the station and the planet Bajor before they ended their decades-long occupation of the system; and they already have several other orbs in their possession.

The orb gives Sisko and Dax powerful visions of their respective pasts. Sisko recalls meeting his future (late) wife Jennifer (Felicia Bell) on what looks like a sunny, hot California beach (guessing Malibu?). The vision reopens old wounds for the still-grieving widower.

Dax sees herself on an operating table, with her symbiont's former host Curzon dying quietly nearby. Curzon's still-living symbiont is then transferred into her body...this was the moment she became the dual-being that she is now.

The story then becomes a race to stop the Cardassians from learning the whereabouts of the celestial temple before the DS9 crew can locate it themselves.

The shapeshifting Odo provides a nifty little bit of sabotage to slow the Cardassians down (that a security chief would use sabotage as a means to an end demonstrates the grayer morality of life aboard this Bajoran-run space station versus life aboard a rule-abiding Federation starship. I found that very interesting...).

Dax and Sisko take a runabout (think: bigger shuttlecraft) out to look for the famed 'celestial temple.' They instead discover a wormhole; a wormhole that leads to the other side of the galaxy, into the "gamma quadrant" 70,000 light years away. Turns out the wormhole IS the celestial temple, and it is inhabited by non-linear beings (rather similar to the faceless aliens who created the monolith in "2001: A Space Odyssey").

At this point, Dax is (somehow?) sent back to DS9 by the aliens, but they keep their 'emissary' Benjamin Sisko. Sisko tries communicating directly with his hosts, but they can only appear to him as people he's seen or met over his lifetime (implying that they have no physical forms themselves; not too unlike the original series' "Organians" from the episode "Errand of Mercy").

These wormhole aliens ('prophets') have no concept of our linear, corporeal existence, and they are initially distrustful of Sisko's "aggressive, adversarial" nature. Using his favorite game of baseball as a clever means of explaining linear time and existence, Sisko gains the wormhole prophets' grudging trust.

In the end, they also give Sisko the impetus to get over his lingering grief over Jennifer by reminding him that such prolonged angst is "not linear" and therefore not compatible with continued existence. Sisko eventually understands what the prophets are getting at; as long as he continues to wallow in grief, there is no moving forward with his life (or his son's).

Through their unintended intervention, the prophets allow Sisko to accept his new life as their 'emissary' and embrace his new duty (and adventures) as commander of Deep Space Nine.

Sisko's runabout returns a short time later, towing a disabled Cardassian vessel left behind in the wormhole, and thus ending an attack on the station by several trigger-happy Cardassian warships. All of the enemy vessels are sent home with their tails between their legs.

By the end of the pilot, we see Sisko and his son reunited and we get a glimpse of day-to-day life aboard this new station.

The End.

To be honest, I wasn't completely blown away by "Emissary" (just as I wasn't entirely blown away by "Encounter at Farpoint").

Some of the quasi-religious sounding mumbo jumbo about 'prophets' and 'destiny' left me a bit less-than-comfortable (I've always preferred my Star Trek to remain somewhat agnostic), but the positives of the pilot still outweighed those relatively minor issues.

I immediately got that the Cardassian-looted space station was a metaphor for the post-riot Los Angeles of 1992 (the now historic "L.A. Riots" had occurred only the previous summer). Sisko's call for Quark to stand as a 'community leader' echoed the sentiments of many Los Angeles area shopkeepers who decided to stay and rebuild following the L.A. Riots' devastation.

I also appreciated the scale and production value of the pilot. It was far smoother and more surefooted than the initially shaky "Encounter at Farpoint." At the very least, I was certainly intrigued enough to see where it'd go next.

So I stuck with it. And I was rewarded with an initially slow-burning series that soon exploded into one of my favorite science fiction series of all time...

Things I really like about Deep Space Nine:

* A rich tapestry of primary and secondary characters.

The new characters are introduced with much more confidence and aplomb than the somewhat more awkward introductions of the Next Generation crew six years earlier. The new characters develop quite nicely from their stable foundations established in the pilot episode.

This cast of characters, and an equally fascinating cast of secondary characters, would undergo some of the most extreme arcs in Star Trek history. Dr. Bashir would be revealed to be a closeted genetically engineered superhuman (that Clark Kent affectation in "Emissary" made a bit more sense after that; even if the actor was unaware of that future development then). Widower Sisko would marry again, and his new wife Kassidy Yates (played by "The Orville" 's Penny Johnson), a former freighter captain/smuggler, would be expecting their first child together by the series' end.

Major Kira (a former terrorist, by the way; try to imagine a new series with the balls to do that) would be involved in an off-again/on-again relationship with the grumpy shapeshifter Odo. Jadzia Dax would die by the end of S6, and her Dax symbiont would be given to a new character, station counselor Ezri Dax (the amiable Nicole De Boer). Chief Miles O'Brien and his wife Keiko (Rosalind Chao) would welcome a second child into their family. And the noncommissioned, earthy Irish chief would also develop a deep, unlikely bromance with the intellectual, fastidious Dr. Bashir. They become the station's true odd couple.

Even a seemingly minor character like Quark's illiterate young nephew Nog (Aron Eisenberg) would go on to become a heroic Starfleet cadet (and later an officer). He'd even lose a leg in combat during the final season. Nog arguably has the greatest arc of the entire crew; from low-level hoodlum to indispensable hero (!).

Cardassian villain Gul Dukat (Marc Alaimo), former head of the occupation of Bajor, would go on to become a tragically demented but truly unhinged megalomaniac by series' end.

We would also meet (in the 2nd episode) an enigmatic Cardassian tailor named "Garak" ("plain, simple Garak"). We soon learn that Garak is a former operative of the "Obsidian Order" (think: Cardassian CIA) with many stories to tell. He is brought to vivid life throughout the series by "Dirty Harry" 's 'Scorpio Killer' Andy Robinson, who is utterly brilliant. By series' end, he is one of my favorite characters; and with this bunch, that's an embarrassment of riches.

In its 4th season, Next Generation's resident Klingon Worf (Michael Dorn) would come aboard and change the dynamic of the series a bit. Turns out the surly Klingons were a perfect match for the grayer morality and shadier dealings aboard the station. While some complained that the series became "The Worf Show," that was never truly the case; if anything, his presence only added to the colorful ensemble, but never overshadowed it. There were still plenty of other characters spotlighted during those final four years of the series.

There were countless other so-called secondary characters; Quark's brother (and Nog's dad) Rom (Max Grodenchik), his future-wife Leeta (Chase Masterson), Bajoran 'pope' Kai Winn (played by Oscar winner Louise Fletcher!), Dominion liaison Weyoun (the incomparable Jeffrey Combs), holographic Rat-Pack era crooner Vic Fontaine (played by '60s teen idol James Darren) and so many more. These characters often headlined their own episodes, and almost any one of them were interesting enough to have held a lead slot on their own Star Trek series. To call them secondary characters seems almost vaguely insulting, considering their contributions to the show.

DS9 dove into character development like no Star Trek series before or since. The rich tapestry of characters is the very core of Deep Space Nine, and that core remains its best feature.

* Amazing production values for 1990s televison.

DS9's production team (under Rick Berman and the late Michael Piller) assembled most of the same team that had worked on Star Trek steadily for the last few years, so they were bound to apply a bit more experience to this pilot. The sheer size of the Deep Space Nine interiors was staggering for the time. The operations center of the station is a multilevel, high ceiling chamber with an enclosed office at the rear. The 'promenade' decks are multistoried as well, with a large bar, shops, a breakfast area and alien restaurants lining the walls. Along the upper walkways, there are giant orbed windows with starscapes visible in the distance. It's like LAX in space, and delivered on a 1990s syndicated television budget (!).

Later on, in its third year, the series got a new starship as well; the USS Defiant. While she may have looked like a flying toilet seat, she had teeth; and she could kick some serious enemy ass. She would partake in some of the most epic space battles in all of Star Trek (those dizzying flyovers!). The Defiant also gave the show a unique advantage over other Trek shows; it could be both a ship series and a character-driven homefront show. Truly the best of both worlds...

* The storytelling and writing of DS9 helped blaze the trail for modern serialized television.

DS9 writers/producers such as Ron Moore (who would go on to reimagine a brilliant new version of "Battlestar Galactica" in 2003), Ira Steven Behr, Naren Shankar, Rene Echevarria, Robert Hewitt-Wolfe and many others would take advantage of the show's 'middle child' status (Next Generation and Voyager seemed to be the darlings of Paramount Studios then) to develop DS9 like no other Star Trek. Their relative freedom to do as they wished paid off handsomely for the fans. DS9 would embrace the serialized style of storytelling that is the norm today (see: "Dexter," "Breaking Bad," "House of Cards", etc). At a time when most audiences were comfortable with standalone storytelling, DS9 took them into a longterm relationship with its characters that was far more deep and satisfying than the one-night flings of late 1980s/early 1990s television.

Now for the hardest part of this post:

My personal favorites of each season.

So hard to choose from such a rich assortment, but here goes...

Season 1: "Emissary" (nice kickoff) "Duet" (Kira's best, and Harris Yulin is arguably the series' finest guest star) "In the Hands of the Prophets" (all-too relevant today). First season is arguably the weakest (and certainly the shortest).

Season 2: "Invasive Procedures" (great Dax episode) "Whispers" (right out of Philip K. Dick), "The Wire" (best Garak episode), "The Jem'Hadar" (a preview of things to come).

Season 3: "Past Tense" parts 1 & 2 (DS9 takes on homelessness in a big way and it pays off), "Improbable Cause/The Die Is Cast" (great Garak/Odo two-parter), "The Adversary" ("The Thing" in space...).

Season 4: "Way of the Warrior" (sort of a second pilot for the series that introduces Worf to the family), "The Visitor" (arguably a series' best; guest star Tony Todd owns this story), "Rejoined" (great Dax episode, and a pre-"Discovery" attempt to show a gay Star Trek relationship), "Homefront"/"Paradise Lost" (post 9/11 paranoia, several years ahead of time...).

Season 5: "Apocalypse Rising" (Sisko, O'Brien and Odo do Klingon cosplay), "Trials and Tribble-ations" (the most fun episode of the show; a love letter to the original series), "For the Uniform" (Sisko goes Inspector Javert on traitor Michael Eddington's ass), "Dr. Bashir, I Presume?" (Bashir's best), "Children of Time" (a poignant time-travel tragedy) and "Call to Arms" (hell of a cliffhanger).

Season 6: "Sacrifice of Angels" (Sisko and company retake the station), "You Are Cordially Invited" (Dax's bachelorette party is a blast), "Far Beyond the Stars" (Avery Brooks' passion project, and it shows), "In the Pale Moonlight" (Sisko, with Garak's help, crosses the line...into my personal favorite episode).

Season 7: "Treachery, Faith and the Great River..." (great Odo/Weyoun interplay), "It's Only a Paper Moon" (Nog's best), "Chimera" (a strong metaphor for bisexuality), and the rich, slightly overstuffed 90 minute finale, "What We Leave Behind..." (the best finale for a Star Trek series yet filmed).

Over those seven seasons (1993-1999), Deep Space Nine would go onto become one of the most creatively (if not always commercially) successful Star Trek incarnations ever. It's still my favorite of the post-TOS Star Trek spinoffs.

Deep Space Nine is also one of my favorite science fiction series of all time; and that's a list that includes "Twilight Zone" "The Prisoner" "Battlestar Galactica" (2003-2009 version) and "Doctor Who."

I enjoy it just as much today as I did in the 1990s. Perhaps even more so.

Guess I'm a Niner for life...

AdvertisementsBeyond the town, down by the bus station next to the old mill was a park, nicknamed Sawmill Park by the old timers. It was here that on the weekends Mae and Gregg would play together if they weren't round each others houses or by the tracks. It was now coming to the end of the first term at Elementary School, meaning that together they had a whole week to get up to mischief and "crimes" which Gregg had nicknamed them. As Candy pulled up and parked, she looked back at Mae and Gregg, sitting in the backseat through the rear view mirror. The two were chatting excitedly and hastily undoing their seat-belts so they could leave. "Calm down you two," she said as she undid hers. As Candy exited the car so did Mae and Gregg, slamming the doors shut much to her dismay. The two kids began to run along the path to the park when Candy shouted after them, "Hang on!" Mae stopped and listened to her mother as Gregg began to unlock the wooden gate. "I'm going to look around for Aunt Molly quickly, just to see if she's doing her rounds currently, will just be a tick, don't wander off and stay within my eyesight!" "Yeeees mum" Mae responded, she tilted her head back as she said this with frustration. When her mum turned away she quickly joined Gregg who shut the gate on her just as she was about to enter. "Not cool Gregg, not cool..." Mae said pulling on the latch. "Last one to the boat is a rotten egg!" Gregg called, already running to the giant structure. The park didn't consist of too much, but its main attraction of it was a large wooden boat, with a climbing frame on top, which Mae had aspired to climb to the top to and then onto the power lines one day, but knew that in order to do that she had to get past the first few rungs of the ladder. Beyond the boat were some different sized logs which grew taller as you walked up them, behind the park there was a small valley where the high school kids like to hang at night, and where the rope swing is. Mae caught up with Gregg at the boat, but by the time she was there he was already climbing. "I beat you!" Gregg called out to her from above, reaching the top of the climbing frame where there was an overlook of the track and all of Possum Springs. "It'snot really fair considering you had a head start!" Mae said as she began to climb. Some uneasiness began to overtake her, she had never made it to the top before but she wasn't going to let Gregg know that, after all she was a cat, and climbing is in her nature. Mae gripped upwards for the grip to pull her up and one by one she climbed not daring to look down. As she was beginning to reach the top she stopped for a moment, taking in what she doing, before pushing on and eventually she had got there in the end. She felt proud of herself for overcoming her fear, it was her first time up at the top and from up there the town looked beautiful. Mae saw Gregg in the corner, reading some of the carving indented onto the wall. "That took you awhile!" he mocked. Mae scrambled over to him. "Shuttup" she said. "What's the matter? Never climbed up here before?" "Well... duh... of course I have, plenty of times, but not with you... with my other friends." "You don't have any other friends Mae," Gregg said jokingly. Mae lightly pushed him before sitting down to join him at what he was looking at. "Anything interesting?" she asked. "Not really, there's that though which is funny!" he said, pointing at what someone had written onto the wood:

CALL HALEY HOROWITZ FOR FUN BUM TIMES!

After a checkered career that began with ferrying around the most evil man in history, a 1939 armoured Mercedes-Benz limousine is looking for a new owner.

The 770K Grosser Offener Tourenwagen (large convertible touring car) was delivered to German dictator Adolf Hitler just weeks before he plunged the planet into its most devastating conflict.

Captured by U.S. forces after the end of the Second World War, it is now set to be auctioned on Jan. 18 by Arizona-based Worldwide Auctioneers.

"We are acutely aware of the responsibility attached to presenting such an impactful piece of history for public sale," auctioneer Rod Egan said in a statement.

The auction house has called the limousine "the most historically significant automobile ever offered for public sale." Although Worldwide Auctioneers did not provide an estimated sale price, it's entirely likely the car could end up ranking as one of history's most expensive used cars.

The heavily armoured limousine was a "Fuhrer-car"; part of a fleet used to ferry around Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.

Most notably, it was the car that carried Hitler in a Berlin victory parade celebrating the defeat of France. That parade, incidentally, was on June 6, 1940, exactly four years before allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy to roll back the German occupation.

According to historical research provided by Worldwide Auctioneers, the car ignominiously ended its Nazi career as a getaway car.

In the closing weeks of the Second World War, a carload of SS officers were reportedly using the limousine to flee the Allied advance when they were ambushed and killed by partisans near the Belgian border. The car was then abandoned in a canal.

After it was recovered by local civilians, it was briefly used by occupying U.S. forces as part of a motor pool in France. A Belgian businessman then took possession and used it as his personal vehicle, until local authorities reportedly banned the driving of such an explicit reminder of their former German occupiers.

The car was shipped to the United States by Tom Austin, an exporter who acquired the vehicle in trade for $1,800 in tobacco. From 1949 to 1976 the car was owned by a Veterans of Foreign Wars branch in Tennessee, whose members used it to carry the mothers of fallen soldiers in local parades.

Sales of Nazi memorabilia can be controversial due to fears that they may be acquired by neo-Nazis as objects of veneration.

In 2000, for instance, the Canadian War Museum considered auctioning off its own former Nazi staff car to raise funds for a new location. After a torrent of complaints, the museum backtracked.

We can't control who buys it. This car would be such a powerful icon for a neo-Nazi or extreme group

"We can't control who buys it. This car would be such a powerful icon for a neo-Nazi or extreme group," then-museum director Jack Granatstein told Canadian Press at the time.

This particular car, in fact, has already been in the hands of an owner with a suspicious fondness for the Third Reich.

Between 1983 and 2004 the car was owned by Las Vegas casino magnate Ralph Engelstad, who kept it on display at the Imperial Palace Auto Collection.

In 1989, Engelstad was fined $1.5 million by Nevada gaming authorities for sullying the image of Las Vegas through his persistent love of Nazi imagery. The casino owner reportedly maintained a private room packed with Nazi memorabilia and had once held a Nazi-themed staff party on Hitler's birthday.

Worldwide Auctioneers has been careful to note that their sale is in no way intended to celebrate or glorify Nazi Germany.

"The very survival and continued existence of this motorcar today serves to remind humankind of the final and inevitable Allied victory over the evil that Hitler and his Nazi party represented," reads their description of the car. All told, the auction house's write-up on the car includes the word "evil" six times.

"It did not choose its user or its use," the write-up adds.

In addition, Worldwide Auctioneers has announced that 10 per cent of the sale price will be donated to an unspecified Holocaust education charity.

Despite its monstrous provenance, the car is indeed a marvel of automotive engineering. Indeed, Nazi Germany's aptitude for all things mechanical is part of what made the Second World War particularly long and deadly.

Crafted largely by hand, the car is one of only 88 were made — most of which did not survive the Second World War's final months. Despite its bulletproof opulence, the Grosser was built to handle speeds of 180 km/h.

Unlike other wartime German staff cars that have been falsely advertised as "Hitler's car" throughout the years, there is ample documentation to trace this vehicle directly to the Fuhrer's personal usage.

It did not choose its user or its use

Ironically, the direct linkage to Hitler was not even known until after the car had been in the United States for several decades.

At the time of its use by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, for instance, it was known simply as a staff car of the "German secret police." Other owners believed it may have been used by top Nazi Heinrich Himmler, the leading architect of the Holocaust.

The truth behind the car is owed largely to the archival research of a Canadian, Ludwig Kosche, who served as a librarian for the Canadian War Museum in the 1970s.

• Twitter: TristinHopper | Email: thopper@nationalpost.comThe first emperor of China exercised his unprecedented administrative power by ordering an imperial quest for the "elixir of life," a medicine that would make him immortal, according to a new analysis of ancient Chinese records.

The empire-wide medical project marshalled the power of doctors, farmers, tradesmen, couriers and soldiers, all centrally controlled by the court of Qin Shi Huang, who united the warring states of ancient China and made them function as one.

He ordered progress reports on his quest for eternal life, some of which are detailed in a massive set of wooden bamboo slips that are painted with imperial records, which have been closely studied since their discovery in 2002.

According to a report in the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, a new analysis shows how the emperor's quest for immortality was carried out, and how a village called Duxiang, for example, sent word that no "miraculous potion" had yet been found, but the search "would continue."

Another place, Langya, in what is now Shandong Province, south of the modern capital Beijing, sent a mountain herb to the emperor, with praise for its auspicious properties, the records show.

The quest illustrated the efficiency of an early mail service, the state of medical knowledge and practice, and the rapidly expanding authority of a warrior king with a reputation for cruelty and vanity. This was happening in the third century BCE, at about the same time as Roman influence was first expanding beyond Italy.

"It required a highly efficient administration and strong executive force to pass down a government decree in ancient times when transportation and communication facilities were undeveloped," said Zhang Chunlong, a researcher at the Hunan province archaeology institute, according to the Xinhua report.

Zhang studied the slips that relate to medicine in the collection known as the Liye Qin Slips, which date from 222 to 208 BCE. These are rare original records of the Qin Dynasty, 36,000 pieces, discovered in an archeological dig in 2002. Most of what is known about the era was recorded later in the Han Dynasty, but these give a contemporary glimpse into the functioning of early Imperial China.

One thing that is well known is the first emperor's desire for eternal life. That much has been world famous at least since the discovery in the 1970s of the Qin terracotta army, an array of thousands of statues of soldiers, now one of China's biggest tourist attractions. These are laid out as protection for the emperor's mausoleum near modern Xian. It is a great tomb mound built over his lifetime, surrounded by a vast city, once said to be fitted with booby-trapped bows set to fire arrows at intruders.

Much of the army is unearthed, but the tomb and most of the necropolis remain unexcavated and unknown, except by imaging technology.

Qin Shi Huang is also famous for press-ganging peasants into building the Great Wall of China, which first came together under his imperial rule. He died in 210 BCE, reportedly because he ingested mercury or some other poison on the advice of his court alchemists and doctors, hoping it would bring him eternal life.

• Email: jbrean@nationalpost.com | Twitter: josephbreanThe Aviation Safety Network today released the 2017 airliner accident statistics showing an extremely low total of 10 fatal airliner accidents, resulting in 44 fatalities.

The year 2017 turned out to be the safest year ever for commercial aviation, Aviation Safety Network data show.

Over the year 2017 the Aviation Safety Network recorded a total of 10 fatal airliner accidents [1], resulting in 44 occupant fatalities and 35 persons on the ground. This makes 2017 the safest year ever, both by the number of fatal accidents as well as in terms of fatalities. In 2016 ASN recorded 16 accidents and 303 lives lost.

Five accidents involved cargo flights, five were passenger flights. Given the expected worldwide air traffic of about 36,800,000 flights, the accident rate is one fatal passenger flight accident per 7,360,000 flights.

The low number of accidents comes as no surprise, according to ASN President Harro Ranter: "Since 1997 the average number of airliner accidents has shown a steady and persistent decline, for a great deal thanks to the continuing safety-driven efforts by international aviation organisations such as ICAO, IATA, Flight Safety Foundation and the aviation industry."

On December 31, aviation had a record period of 398 days with no passenger jet airliner accidents. Additionally, a record period of 792 days passed since the previous civil aircraft accident claiming over 100 lives [2].

One out of 10 accident airplanes was operated by an airline on the E.U. "blacklist".

[1] Statistics are based on all worldwide fatal commercial aircraft accidents (passenger and cargo flights) involving civil aircraft of which the basic model has been certified for carrying 14 or more passengers. Consequently, the June 7 accident involving a Myanmar Air Force Y-8F transport plane that killed 122 is not included.

When including military transport aircraft as well as non-commercial flights, the total number fatalities would be 230 in 24 fatal accidents. Still the lowest numbers in modern aviation history.

[2] Last fatal passenger jet airliner accident: 28 Nov. 2016, Avro RJ85 LaMia, near Medellin, Colombia

Last civil aircraft accident claiming over 100 lives: 31 Oct. 2015, Airbus A321 Metrojet, North Sinai, Egypt (224 fatalities)

The Aviation Safety Network is an independent organisation located in the Netherlands. Founded in 1996. It has the aim to provide everyone with a (professional) interest in aviation with up-to-date, complete and reliable authoritative information on airliner accidents and safety issues. ASN is an exclusive service of the Flight Safety Foundation (FSF). The figures have been compiled using the airliner accident database of the Aviation Safety Network, the Internet leader in aviation safety information. The Aviation Safety Network uses information from authoritative and official sources.

First Real Bitcoin Lightning Network Payment Completed via Bitrefill

Considering the persistent issues with the system at the moment, fast and cheap bitcoin (BTC) transactions might sound like a distant dream, but its realization might be just around the corner. The first transaction using real bitcoin to make a payment on the lighting network has recently been completed via mobile top-up service Bitrefill.

Lightning Payment on Bitrefill

Software developer Alex Bosworth has revealed that he successfully completed the first lightning bitcoin mainnet (not a testing environment) transaction for an online purchase at Bitrefill. He paid his own actual phone bill with no fees, which executed instantly. Bitrefill is an online service that enables users top up their prepaid mobile phone plans with bitcoin and litecoin with over 600 operators across 150 countries.

The Lightning Network is a scaling solution that has been in development for a few years already. The protocol creates an off-chain system by forming a network of payment channels where funds are not entrusted to a third party. It theoretically promises to scale bitcoin by allowing thousands of transactions per second without compromising its trustless nature.

Bitrefill CEO, Sergej Kotliar, explained to news.bitcoin.com the motivation for this development by his team. "As we all know, blockchains currently don't scale for consumer payments and currently require tradeoffs between decentralization and efficiency. Lightning is a tool that can enable the best of both worlds – a great customer experience (both fast and cheap), but also trustless custody of funds. So we're eager to enable it as a payment method and do what we can to support developments on that front."

Full Steam Ahead

This payment integration with Lightning has been surprisingly easy and the company is already working on further developments, Kotliar explained to us. "At first we've enabled Bitrefill orders to be paid with Lightning. That's the easiest integration for us. Next step will be enabling full lightning support (send and receive) in our user accounts."

As to how he sees his company's role in the larger development of the network, the CEO said: "A common problem with new technology and innovation is actually implementing things in production. That's also where real issues pop up. We're a small company, but we think that it's important to help where we can. In our case it's at least implementing this new piece of technology as it becomes available and provide testing. Credit belongs where credit is due with all of the independent and corporate developers of the Lightning protocol."

Bitrefill most recently made headlines when it came to the rescue of bitcoin PC gamers after Steam announced that the popular online games store would no longer accept BTC as a method of payment. "I can't share revenue numbers but I'll tell you that Steam voucher sales far exceeded our expectations, Kotliar commented. "We're looking to add more voucher products to our service soon."

Would the lightning network be the cure-all for bitcoin's current ills? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below.

The historic Salmiya structure was the home of the late Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Salem Al- Sabah, the twelfth ruler of Kuwait.

Construction began in 1926 but the house was built over three stages. The house was built in the style and tradition of the pre-oil era, representing an important period of Kuwait's architectural history. It has an internal courtyard, high ceilings and a traditional Kuwaiti house layout.

More importantly, it has served for years as a local cultural and community center, offering a range of arts, music and photography classes, providing a space for community events and in recent years serving as a home for the popular used bookshop, Q8 Books. The nonprofit Bayt Lothan's primary objective was to nurture arts and crafts in Kuwait and provide the people of Kuwait a place to exhibit their designs and artistic work.

Dozens of local artists, architects, designers and photographers have visited in recent days as a way to document the structure before it is demolished.

Dr Jawaher Al-Bader, Kuwait University Department of Communication Design and Interior Architecture Professor, opposes the plan to demolish Bayt Lothan. She brought a class of students to draw Bayt Lothan this way in order to document the building.

"We have here future designers and architects; we brought them here to feel the place for the last time, document the place...What we are doing now is very important, there is no existing records of the physical design of the place and no blueprint, so now we are measuring it. I understand the owners want to generate money rather than preserve history. But we are depriving the next generations from witnessing the structures of Kuwait's past," she said. Plans for Bayt Lothan's demolition have sparked outrage and opposition among Kuwait's society.

Dr Lamis Behbehani agrees with the sentiment: "It's an unfortunate decision to make. We don't have many historical places.... Only this place is available, most of the old buildings are abandoned and derelict, but this one was preserved because it was used by Bayt Lothan, and because of that, we were able to experience how Kuwait in the past lived," she said. "Why would they [demolish Bayt Lothan] without considering the historical value of the place?" she asked. A petition has been started on Change.org with nearly 3,500 signatures as of Tuesday afternoon. On the petition page, the organizers call on the owners to "consider the historical, cultural, and economic value of Bayt Lothan...." Hundreds of signers left comments in support of stopping the demolition. "Bayt Lothan is a part of Kuwait's heritage and it's sad to see it demolished for the sake of building yet another mall in a country filled with malls," wrote Yousef Al Abdulhadi.

Speaking with the Kuwait Times at Bayt Lothan in Salmiya, Walid Thakur, Administration and Finance Manager confirmed that the planned demolition will take place by the end of March. "This property is not our own. This is a private property; the owner had already given us six months notice to vacate the place, we are complying with the order and the Bayt Lothan team is winding down operations; we will obediently follow and leave this place as agreed," he said.

"The place is used not just by Kuwaitis but by communities of people wanting to exhibit their arts and designs. The place is also used as venue for cultural presentations and charity events," Thakur mentioned. "Since we started in 1993, this period is the saddest part because I have been here since the beginning of Bayt Lothan operations; being here and being involved in many activities of this center, very saddened to leave the place you once called home. It has been our home and a place for honing young people talents in arts," he said.

By Ben GarciaAs of December 31, China's legal, government-sanctioned ivory trade will come to a close. All of the country's licensed ivory carving factories and retailers will be shuttered in accordance with a landmark 2015 announcement from Chinese President Xi Jinping and then U.S. President Barack Obama.

China and the U.S. both agreed to "near-complete" ivory bans, which prohibit the buying and selling of all but a limited number of antiques and a few other items. The U.S.'s ivory ban went into effect in June 2016. China's goes into effect December 31, 2017.

China is widely believed to be the world's largest consumer of ivory, both legal and illegal, and it plays a major role in the yearly slaughter of some 30,000 African elephants by poachers. Ivory is in demand for intricate carvings, trinkets, chopsticks, and other items.

"The Chinese government's ban on its domestic ivory trade sends a message to the general public in China that the life of elephants is more important than the ivory carving culture," said Gao Yufang, a Ph.D. student in conservation biology and cultural anthropology at Yale University and a National Geographic Explorer, in an email. "This is a significant step forward."

An international ivory trade ban went into effect in 1990, but China continued to allow—and even promote—ivory sales within its borders. Its legal ivory supply came primarily from a one-time sale of ivory from a handful of African countries in 2008. But this legal domestic market has provided the opportunity for traffickers to slip illegally obtained ivory into China's legal supply. Many conservationists have said that this one-time legal sale helped drive a dramatic increase in elephant poaching.

View Images A visitor takes a picture of a carved ivory tusk at an exhibition in 2009. The Chinese government used to promote ivory carving as part of its cultural heritage, but the new ban on ivory sales to protect elephants reflects changing priorities, conservationists say.

"It is difficult to predict to what extent China's ivory ban can reduce elephant poaching in Africa because many factors are at play," Yufang said. "But it has been observed that in China prices of ivory products have dropped considerably, and the market is already shrinking."

Experts say the key to making the ban successful is enforcement and education. "Law enforcement in China tends to be hindered by poor coordination between different agencies, unclear authorization and accountability, and a lack of capable personnel on the ground," Yufang said.

While many Chinese are becoming more aware and sensitive to conservation and wildlife issues, ivory's draw as the ultimate status symbol has been hard to overcome. As National Geographic reported earlier this year:

In Chinese the word for ivory is xiangya, meaning "elephant tooth," which has led many to believe erroneously that ivory can be taken from an elephant without inflicting harm. The nonprofit International Fund for Animal Welfare did polling in 2007 in China that found that 70 percent of respondents didn't realize an elephant had to be killed to take its ivory.

View Images Other than the threat posed by poaching, "fostering healthy coexistence between local people and African elephants," is the biggest challenge says conservationist Gao Yufang. Photograph by Carl de Souza, AFP, Getty Images

China's State Forestry Administration, the agency in charge of enforcing the new ban, is embarking on a campaign to make sure the country's citizens are aware of the law. Working with the Natural Resources Defense Council, Wildaid, China Wildlife Conservation Association, and the China-based SEE Foundation, an environmental NGO, there will be posters, videos, and articles spread across traditional and social media outlets telling people to protect endangered elephants by respecting the law and saying "no to ivory."

In March the first wave of factories and retailers closed. A recent survey by the World Wildlife Fund and the wildlife trade monitoring organization TRAFFIC, however, found that only 19 percent of people surveyed knew about the ban. But once they were told of the ban, 86 percent of those surveyed said they supported it.

"By closing its ivory markets, China is showing its commitment to end its role in the poaching epidemic plaguing Africa's elephants," said Ginette Hemley, a senior vice president of WWF and a TRAFFIC board member, in a press release. "It is critical that efforts to enact the ivory trade ban are accompanied by efforts to change consumer behavior in order to reduce demand."Why is Germany obsessed with this obscure British film?

'Same procedure as last year?' - James the butler is a reminder of Britain's class structure

Dinner For One is a cultural phenomenon.

The 18-minute British sketch has dominated German television every New Year's Eve since 1972, has spawned catchphrases and drinking games, and is almost unheard of in the UK.

The black-and-white sketch stars Freddie Frinton as James, an elderly butler serving May Warden's Miss Sophie on her 90th birthday.

Miss Sophie has invited her four closest friends for a celebratory dinner, the only problem being that these friends are all long deceased.

James is forced to take their place, stumbling around the dinner table, adopting their voices and personas and making toasts on their behalf, knocking back four glasses of sherry, white wine, champagne and port in the process

This is clearly not the first time James has had to endure this alcoholic onslaught.

Before each course, James asks "same procedure as last year?" - to which Miss Sophie replies "same procedure as every year".

This has become a common expression in Germany, and is an accurate summation of the attitude of German audiences to their much loved film.

The sketch ends with a soused and unsteady James escorting Miss Sophie up to her bedroom, with an innuendo-laden "same procedure as last year?...Well, I'll do my very best."

Millions of Germans plan their New Year's Eve celebrations around the sketch and can quote it line by line. Some even attempt to match James drink for drink, which is no mean feat.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, more than 17 million people - around 21% of the German population - tuned in to watch the sketch on 31 December 2016.

By comparison, the most watched show in the UK was the final of the Great British Bake Off, which was watched by 15.9 million people.

The Dinner for One craze has also spread to Scandinavia, South Africa and Australia.

Despite this international success, only 13% of Brits have ever heard of the film, and just 8% said they have actually seen it.

Dr Rainer Stollmann, professor of Cultural Studies at the University of Bremen, says most Germans are unaware of their beloved film's obscurity in the UK.

"90% of Germans have not realised this," Prof Stollmann told me.

"Germans know it as well as they know some of the Grimm fairy tales. They can quote lines from it."

Unsuspecting Brits in Germany might even have the film's catchphrase thrown at them by Germans, assuming the sketch is as well known in the UK as it is Germany.

But why did this sketch find a home in Germany and fall into obscurity in the UK?

A spokesperson for NDR, a German broadcaster that airs the sketch, said it had "a timeless humour" which harks back to "a nostalgic memory of a time when the entire family used to come together to watch TV".

Prof Stollmann argues Brits are put off by the sketch as it forces them to confront the country's class structure as well as painful moments in its imperial past.

The butler repeatedly stumbles over a tiger skin rug laid on the floor, a clear symbol of Britain's occupation of India.

The film doesn't have this connection in Germany.

Prof Stollmann argues that German audiences merely see the sketch as an illustration of "a British flair" and, despite appearing quintessentially British, exudes "German humour in a British costume".

Regardless of the cause of the sketch's popularity, it has been a mainstay of German festive viewing for nearly 50 years.

So, German audiences remain captivated by this silly piece of British slapstick from the sixties. It is a comforting routine. The same procedure as every year.Michael Gehlken of the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports that the Raiders are expected to move on from WR Michael Crabtree this offseason.

According to Gehlken, changes are coming for the Raiders after a disappointing season in which they failed to build on their 2016 success and it's likely that Crabtree will be among them.

Ghelken points out that released Crabtree would result in no dead money, considering that he didn't receive a signing bonus or guarantees in the second half of the agreement.

Crabtree, 30, is a former first-round pick of the 49ers back in 2009. He spent six years in San Francisco before signing on with the Raiders in 2015.

Crabtree is in the third year of his five-year, $34 million contract that included $19 million guaranteed and stands to make base salaries of $6.25 million and $7 million over the next two years of the agreement.

According to OverTheCap.com, releasing Crabtree would free up $7,687,500 of available cap space while creating no dead money.

In 2017, Crabtree has appeared in 13 games and caught 56 passes for 601 yards receiving and eight touchdowns for the Raiders. Pro Football Focus has him rated as the No. 58 receiver out of 116 qualifying players.Ask the community

Twitter is one of the most powerful websites ever. It can create and change opinions, enlighten the masses and even teach you how to cook. It can also make players All-Stars. Nets fans have taken to the website to try and get Spencer Dinwiddie to represent the Eastern Conference.

While some players make the All-Star based on merit, or even simply tradition, others need a little help. That is why the league lets fans vote. Think Zaza Pachulia last season, who nearly made the team, or Allen Iverson in 2010, who made the team despite not playing for a majority of the season. Spencer Dinwiddie could possibly be the next social media made All-Star.

While the Brooklyn Nets' starting point guard has had a great season, he has done so quietly. When it comes to the All-Star game, this poses problem as recognition is everything. The more easily fans can recognize you, the easier it is to get in.

In order to get around that particular hurdle, fans have taken to Twitter and, according to Dinwiddie, have flooded the Colorado product's mentions.

Whoever organized all this and is flooding my mentions with Spencer Dinwiddie #NBAVote I appreciate y'all lol ✊🏾 — Spencer Dinwiddie (@SDinwiddie_25) December 31, 2017

Unlike in past years when players had to be voted in, the league has changed up the format of the All-Star Game. Rather than voting for the conference's starters, fans now vote for captains. The two players with the highest votes become captains and then can choose who they want to play with based a pool of vote getters.Over the last few weeks, we have been somewhat fortunate to win the games we have; since the win at QPR, the performances have been below standard. You can't expect to play poorly and continually win games. At some point, it will catch up to you, and that is exactly what happened against Birmingham.

But you can learn a lot from an early season defeat: you analyse the players and tactics in more depth and become more grounded in your expectations.

The Birmingham defeat did just that and gave us a lot to contemplate as we head into 2018.

Here are our talking points from the final game of 2017.

1) We allowed Birmingham the impetus

When you face a team in the form that Birmingham found themselves in prior to the game, the first 10–15 minutes can make all the difference to whether you have an easy result.

Leeds failed to exploit this crucial time in the game and allowed a bad Birmingham side to gain confidence and put Leeds on the back foot.

Regardless of their standing in the table, we all know the quality this Birmingham side have at their disposal. The last thing you should give them is the chance to play their football.

Over the last few wins, we have allowed poor teams the chance to feel more comfortable, and it has become a struggle to break them down. Against manager-less Nottingham Forest tomorrow, we'll need to utilise this period in the game, otherwise it might be another long afternoon.

2) The loss highlights the importance of a good window

The Christmas schedule can be a demanding time. With such a short turn around of games, teams need to rely on their squads to carry the burden.

At this point, Leeds do not have the pleasure of having a squad strong enough to make the interchanges needed. Therefore, the team has to rely on those it has for the whole season... and they have become tired.

Alioski is an example of this. We have all seen how effective the Macedonian can be, but in the last few games he has started to struggle with the physicality of the league and has resorted to a direct approach and some unsporting tactics.

Throughout the team, the players look tired and the options on the bench do not fill me with confidence. Hopefully, the result will be a indicator for the board to strengthen during the window.

3) We lost and played poorly... but I am still happy

Yesterday was dreadful, not only from a Leeds point of view, but also from a footballing one. Like I mentioned, the players looked jaded and the game felt like it lasted three days.

However, I want the last talking point of 2017 to be one of positivity, because after the disappointment of failing to reach the playoffs last season, the club has been able to refocus, grow and become an all-around stronger and more-together club.

In my adult life, I can't remember a time when the future has looked so good for Leeds United. We sit fifth in the league, a position of real potential at this stage of the season. The fanbase and club have the same vision going forward, and it is a very exciting time to be a Leeds fan once again.

From us all at Nowt For Second, Happy New Year and thank you for the support over the last 7 months. Here's to a successful 2018.

Game Center CX SP15 - New Year's Eve 2016 - Kiki Kaikai Revenge [SA-GCCX]

Translated by zari-gani Timed by Random Stranger Proofed by HirayukiErica Garner, whose father Eric became a national symbol of excessive police force after a fatal struggle with cops on Staten Island, died early Saturday, her family said.

Garner, 27, suffered "major brain damage" from a heart attack last weekend.

She died at Woodhull Hospital of natural causes, said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who noted her family did not remove Garner from life support because her 8-year-old daughter Alyssa wanted to give her a chance to come out of the coma.

Erica Garner became a political activist after her father died in 2014 death when an NYPD officer placed him in a chokehold while arresting him for selling loose cigarettes.

"She has passed," Sharpton said outside the hospital, with her mother Esaw Snipes-Garner by his side. "Her heart was broken when she didn't get justice. ... The [heart] attack just dealt with the pieces that were left."

Snipes-Garner noted her daughter was born at the same hospital where she died.

"She was a warrior and a fighter. And she fought till the end. From the day she was born she was a fighter," Snipes-Garner said, holding back tears. "We're gonna stay strong as a family and gonna take care of her child and make sure her children know how much she loved them."

Garner leaves behind two children. Her youngest, a son born in August, is named Eric after her father.

Her daughter Alyssa asked the family to "give her time" on Thursday, Sharpton said at a press conference later Saturday after a rally at his Harlem headquarters.

"Esaw and a couple of us were there by the bed, and the daughter said that she wanted to talk to her mother alone, and we all left, and when the daughter came out, she said to her grandmother Esaw... I want y'all to give her time," Sharpton said. "She sensed or knew that there was the question of whether to pull the plug as they say or whether to give it time...They decided to wait even though they'd been told there was little brain activity."

Sharpton said funeral arrangements will be announced later next week. He said Garner's family, and her two children, will "always" have his National Action Network's support.

"Her heart was not broken at the hospital," Sharpton said. "Her heart was broken in a court room that said you can choke her daddy to death on video saying 'I can't breathe' and still get no justice. So the heart attack attacked a broken heart."

Her death was confirmed on her official Twitter account​, which continued to post memories and photos of Garner on Saturday. ​

"Erica the world loves you. I love you. I am glad you came into our lives. May you find the peace in the next life that you deserved while you were here. I will always love you my sister. love you," the account tweeted at 9:36 am. "She passed away this morning. The reports are real. We didn't deserve her."

"When you report this you remember she was human: mother, daughter, sister, aunt. Her heart was bigger than the world. It really really was. She cared when most people wouldn't have. She was good. She only pursued right, no matter what. No one gave her justice," said a follow up tweet at 9:41 a.m.Jonathan Lopez, a Brooklyn sixth-grader in a schoolyard tussle with two girls, got caught up in the sex-harassment tornado.

Jonathan insists he only tried to grab the water bottle and backpack of classmates who had tossed his stuff during lunchtime horseplay.

But the school charged him with "conduct of a sexual nature." He was accused of trying to touch one girl's breast and kiss her and of "humping" another girl from behind.

"Like, I'm not sexual," the baby-faced 11-year-old wrote in a city Department of Education statement. "I do dumb thing [sic] but I'm not sexual to girls."

The dean at MS 88 in Park Slope pressured him to admit lewd behavior or plead "no contest" and waive his right to a hearing, Jonathan told The Post.

"After what you did, I don't want to see you in my school," he said the dean, John Roumbeas, told him.

Jonathan refused. "I told him 'I'm not going to admit to it because I didn't do it.' "

That day, the school banished Jonathan to a distant suspension center, populated by tough older kids who "bring knives," he said. "They roamed around the halls and didn't listen to the teacher."

In the end, a suspension judge found no evidence of breast-touching, kissing or humping and ordered Jonathan's "immediate reinstatement."

But he missed 16 days of classes.

"They treated him like a criminal," fumed his dad, Mahoma Lopez.

The tsunami of sex-harassment allegations in the news "escalated things" against his prepubescent son, Lopez suspects.

"They're real predators," he said of Harvey Weinstein and other offenders. "The school is making an example of my son. He's an innocent kid who just wants to play."

Maria Chickedantz, a feminist lawyer who has known Jonathan since he was 6 and took up his case, described him as sweet and friendly. "The kid hasn't even hit puberty yet. He's little and immature," Chickedantz said.

Jonathan's troubles started on Nov. 22, when a girl classmate complained that Jonathan had harassed her.

"He comes up to me (2 inches away) and pretends to sqush [sic] my chest. Then he runs away. I chase him to tell him to stop," her written statement says. "After he takes my water bottle and I have to chase him up and down and I chased him for 10 minutes. And he said, 'You should be my girlfriend. We can forget about what happened' " and he leaned in and tryed [sic] to kiss me. And he was about 1 foot away."

She said Jonathan had harassed her friend days earlier. That girl gave a statement: "I was walking with my friends when Jonathan comes out of no were [sic] and he lifts up my bag and he is touching my back and he starts humping me. I tell him to stop but he keeps doing it four more times. He humped me one last time and I almost fall down the stairs."

The Dec. 13 hearing was a bust. Roumbeas, the dean, did not show up, so the statements he took were not admitted as evidence.

The first girl who accused Jonathan also did not show. The second girl testified that Jonathan grabbed her waist but she never mentioned "humping."

Hearing officer Anthony Jordan sustained a sole charge that Jonathan "placed his hands" on the girl's waist. He ordered that records of the matter be expunged at the school year's end.

But Jonathan was still treated like a sex offender. On his first day back, the dean warned he was "in more trouble" for not confessing, Chickedantz wrote in an e-mail to Principal Ailene Altman Mitchell.

"Faculty, staff and students now see him as some sort of sexual predator, which is so unfair," Chickedantz wrote. "Even if the accusations were true, the manner in which the school . . . treated an 11-year old like a dangerous criminal was absolutely unacceptable."

Mitchell and Roumbeas did not return messages. DOE spokeswoman Miranda Barbot said, "The school followed protocol in reporting, investigating and addressing these incidents."Still, 73 percent of Colma's 2.2 square miles is zoned for cemeteries — or "memorial parks," as the operators call them. There are 17 such parks, including those that cater to Italians, Jews, Greek Orthodox, Japanese and Serbs.

Colma, where the two major property owners are a land holding company and the Roman Catholic Church, is in a sense a place where an evolution has come full circle.

"Most Americans used to live near a graveyard in the 18th century," said David C. Sloane, author of "The Last Great Necessity: Cemeteries in American History." "That changed in the 19th century, when big cemeteries were on the edge of the cities and became destinations," the precursors to civic parks. But by the 20th century, Dr. Sloane said, an aversion to dealing with death had made cemeteries places that people "went out of their way not to go to."

Given that environment, clusters of cemeteries in outlying areas may seem only natural. Still, though one occasionally finds several cemeteries grouped together these days, 17 in "a single place is very, very unusual," Dr. Sloane said.

Here, hearses far outnumber hot rods. Colma's museum has a cemetery room, of course. Instead of the metal signs that customarily mark boundaries between towns, new ones made of somber granite have been ordered by town officials. Everyone knows that it is against the law to cross a funeral procession. Wedding parties spill out of stretch limousines to be photographed at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park's duck pond, and weddings themselves are held at the cemetery's small chapel, next to its crematorium.

Colma's motto is "It's Great to Be Alive in Colma!" And residents say they are comfortable being alive among the mausoleums, the marble obelisks and the tombstones. They express appreciation for the tranquillity of their hometown, where a serene, occasionally whimsical attitude toward death prevails.

Having grown up with death, Owen Molloy says that "it doesn't creep me out." Mr. Molloy's family owns the only bar in town, a mourners' gathering place two or three times a week, and he fondly recalls playing hide-and-seek among the tombstones of various graveyards and sipping his first beer, at age 12, among marble angels and Ionic columns. He marvels at the view from the deck of his home, which overlooks Holy Cross Cemetery.

Living alongside the cemeteries "doesn't matter" to Ashley Hurtubise, 16. "It's just another part of town," she said.

City Councilwoman Joanne del Rosario does not give her underground neighbors a second thought. "I'm more afraid of the living," she said, "than I am of the dead."

In the way New Jersey students know that Thomas Edison's laboratory is in West Orange, the people of Colma know that Wyatt Earp's ashes are buried at Hills of Eternity, a Jewish cemetery (he wasn't; his wife was), and that Joe DiMaggio is at Holy Cross Cemetery, where visitors often lean bats against his gravestone.

Everybody knows that Tina Turner's dog is wrapped in her fur coat at Pet's Rest Cemetery, the final stop for 13,000 dogs, cats, rabbits, goldfish and cheetahs. Even after last summer's downsizing, plots remain, though they are so expensive ($550 to $850 and up, depending on the size of the pet) that some families opt for cremation or for stacking their dead pets vertically. Pet's Rest draws so many mourners that, says the owner, Phillip C'de Baca, some form carpools and occasionally fall in love and marry.

Dr. Sloane, an associate professor at the University of Southern California, says there is a growing demand for space at American cemeteries that is fueled in large part by immigrant families who insist on elaborate burials as a way to help establish their identity in a community. In Colma, so little undeveloped property remains that an acre sells for more than $2 million.

The cemeteries have two choices, said Steve Doukas, general manager of Greek Orthodox Memorial Park: build taller mausoleums or buy more land. Either way, added costs are naturally passed along.

"As expensive as it is to live in the Bay Area," Mr. Doukas said, "it's also expensive to be buried here."

Cypress Lawn offers burial plots that cost as much as $20,000, or $250,000 for a family plot, said Ken Varner, its president.

And what does a cemetery ultimately provide for that kind of money? "Memory management," Mr. Varner said.

"Cemeteries," he said, "are really for the living."Another of my favorite OC's,

The Best of the Electric Company (Shout! Factory-2006)

HEY, YOU GUYS!

Just when you thought you couldn't recapture any more of your TV-watching childhood, The Electric Company has surprisingly and blessedly come to DVD. Nowhere near as good as you remember it – with crude graphics, cheesy synthesizers and overlong segments (it's stuffed to the gills at 29 minutes per) – you'll be amazed that you're still entertained long after the lesson had worn off.

The PBS series, "getting its power from" The Children's Television Workshop production studio, was the natural next step in the innovational new wave of programming for kids that evolved in the mind-expanding 1970s. President Nixon declared those ten years "The Right to Read Decade," and a new sense of purpose and style swept both public television and school classrooms, breaking the tired old mold of reading, writing and 'rithmetic.

Sesame Street proved its own theory that pre-schoolers can learn basic educational concepts if presented in the style of comedy skits, catchy advertising jingles and arrestingly visual TV commercials. The Electric Company was developed to appeal to slightly older kids (second and third graders), taking a cue from the musical-comedy variety venues of the day, including The Carol Burnett Show, The Flip Wilson Show and Monty Python's Flying Circus, but its obvious biggest influence was the fast-moving Laugh-In. .

Its aim was to teach "decoding," the ability to analyze sounds and spellings so that even unfamiliar words can be tackled successfully. This was to be accomplished with the utmost respect toward children with learning issues (a tall order – easier said than done).

The mission was accomplished so successfully that even kids without learning disabilities, as well as older kids and adults, turned on to the program, assigning it double duty as an instructive vehicle and a revered pop culture staple. It was so successful in its day that when it was broadcast to many classrooms at 9 a.m., student latenesses were reported to have dropped.

The Electric Company surged for six years in its original run (a whopping 780 episodes), and then educated yet another generation in reruns. This was no low-budget wonder; it was loaded with special effects and original songs (many written by satirist Tom Lehrer), including "Golly, This Lollipop Is Following Me" and "Silent E" ("who can turn a cub into a cube?").

Probably the most famous sketch was the sight of silhouetted profiles of two cast members forming a word together ("CH-AIR, CHAIR"). Perhaps almost as famous is the animated short "The Adventures of Letterman," ("It's a word, it's a plan, it's Letterman!") with the unlikely narration of Joan Rivers and featuring, in voiceover, the unlikely reunion of The Producers' Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel (who, as the villain, grumbles, "I hate happiness!").

Even with an ensemble cast of television and theater actors (uncredited!), the series does not have a "home base," like Sesame Street, but presents its world as an actual page that is meant to be written on or read. And the words always look beautiful.

Embodying the power, sunny confidence and funky fun of the show is young actor Morgan Freeman (yes, that Morgan Freeman), who, as the character Easy Reader, shows that reading is cool (marvel at a film of him strutting through 1970s New York City, blissfully reading signs on the mean streets).

Also on board is educationally minded Bill Cosby and the awesome Rita Moreno, who cheerfully makes herself available for the present-day commentary. It's easily a charisma fest with Moreno, Cosby and Freeman alone, but the circle is complete with a few more unknown but equally talented character actors, including TV-commercial veteran Judy Graubart.

As Moreno states, the show was not aimed at "the little geniuses," but the appeal to baby hipsters in training is undeniable. A pseudo-pop group called The Short Circus rocked out passionately about punctuation and featured Asian-American child-actor June Angela (also on hand for a pleasant and smart commentary visit), who managed to stay with the show for all six seasons.

If you look closely, you'll find Denise Nickerson (who played Violet in Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory) and Irene Cara (who eventually starred in Fame and recorded the '80s hit, "Flashdance – What a Feeling.").

The DVD is a best-of collection, but it covers everything you remember, utilizing mild forms of vaudeville (everything old is new again), as well as a Broadway-musical sense of comedy mixed with can-you-dig it irreverence.

It's not about learning how to read; it's about the joy of reading. Good cause – good show.

In November, activists gathered at a rally to protest SOGI 123, a "sexual orientation and gender identity curriculum resource that has been approved by the Ministry of Education for B.C.'s teachers to use day to day in the classroom."

The rally unsurprisingly stirred controversy and was protested by parents, teachers, and activists.

Protesters here a mix of Chilliwack teachers, parents and advocates including @MorganeOgerNDP pic.twitter.com/19w8T6sI8o — Jessica Peters (@CHWKcommunity) November 22, 2017

Responding to some of those protesting the rally Liberal MLA Laurie Throness took to Twitter to defend its participants as "good, loving, [and] tolerant."

1/ Paul, your comments are incorrect and deeply hurtful to 1000s in Chwk. The people at the rally are good, loving, tolerant, not bullies. — Laurie Throness (@LaurieThroness) November 24, 2017

Others saw things a bit differently.

Did you hear the things said at the rally? It was rife with misinformation and outright lies. Then the laughing at transgendered people, just like high school bullies. — Paul J. Henderson (@PeeJayAitch) November 24, 2017

I think about this tweet a lot. He's referring to people who clapped, laughed, even hollered, at the constant and intentional misgendering of @MorganeOgerNDP at a Culture Guard event. https://t.co/MrkwNOR89o — Patrick Oystryk (@padeeo) December 8, 2017

Reported by local newspaper The Chilliwack Progress, the rally was organized by Culture Guard, a radical social conservative group whose founder Kari Simpson sent a 17-page letter to local trustees attacking Chilliwack school superintendent Evelyn Novak:

"Either your superintendent is gullible and unfit for her position, or she is deliberately misinforming you, the parents, and other educational stakeholders you serve – and in doing so, exposing children to a destructive sectarian agenda...she has devolved the role of public education into the pit of sexual practices, deviance and dysphoric dysfunction by her attempt to advance this insidious and probably harmful political agenda."

According to the group's website: "Culture Guard recognizes that the political tyranny of politically-correct idiotology must cease; and to this end we direct our endeavours."

Simpson, who also spoke at the rally, blasted supporters of SOGI as members of a "hedonistic cult."

Promoters of SOGI a "Hedonistic cult" says Simpson, says it's a way to get kids away from parents to indoctrinate them into sexually deviant lives. #chilliwack — Jessica Peters (@CHWKcommunity) November 22, 2017

Wants to "obliterate" politicians (including school trustees) who support SOGI. pic.twitter.com/2Ur9b7tPEg — Jessica Peters (@CHWKcommunity) November 22, 2017

"They need to be politically obliterated. This is a live or die situation, people, as far as politicians should go. It doesn't get complicated, ok? Either for us, or you're against us. Either you're for protecting kids or you're against protecting kids. This is no longer about the hogwash narrative of LGBTQ safety and all the rest of it. This has nothing to do with that. This is about protecting the children of this province."

Also at the centre of the storm is local trustee Barry Neufeld, who attended the rally as a "guest of honour" despite initially apologizing for suggesting that SOGI resources were "weapons of propaganda."

According to Neufeld, Chilliwack's superintendent is part of a conspiracy of sex activists "who are using the classroom to engage students in a dangerous psychological game of social deconstuctionist [sic] politics."

Neufeld's behaviour have been condemned by no less than B.C.'s Minister of Education Rob Fleming.

In recent weeks Neufeld's statements and social media posts have grown increasingly outlandish.

Suggesting he has been "thrown into the role of a prophet", the local trustee also invoked (in a now-deleted post) a conspiracy that the Canadian government "will apprehend your children and put them in homes where they will be encouraged to explore homosexuality and gender fluidity."

"You think that is impossible? Well the Canadian government did exactly that to Aboriginal families until a few decades ago. Determined to destroy the traditional teachings of their culture and re-educate children into the prevailing worldview of the government."

Weighing in again on the ongoing battle over SOGI in Chilliwack earlier this month Throness wrote a letter to the editor of the Progress.

My letter to the editor on SOGI was published in the Chilliwack Progress yesterday, and I also posted it at https://t.co/HWsekTsFSD — Laurie Throness (@LaurieThroness) December 14, 2017

In the letter Throness expresses his "concern" over SOGI, characterizing it as the "imposition of a monoculture":

"[My concern is that]...helpful teaching about acceptance and tolerance may go further; promoting a philosophy of gender and human nature that may predispose impressionable children and youth to make decisions they will later regret...I am concerned about SOGI's confidentiality provisions that could limit parental knowledge, and therefore their involvement, particularly in the lives of younger students. Finally, I am concerned about the imposition of a monoculture on independent schools."

Writing that "no one thinks that bullying is acceptable" Throness also characterized opposition to SOGI as "a good thing", adding "It is not healthy, particularly for the media which has a special interest in promoting freedom of speech, to shame and condemn those who speak freely."

Given the tone some of that opposition has taken, others – including the union which represents 41,000 public school teachers in B.C. – strongly took issue with Throness' framing of the situation.

Trustee Neufeld stated admiration for Paraguay and Russia's handling of LGBTQ issues. These are jurisdictions where LGBTQ people are jailed, killed, or subjected to state-sanctioned violence. You're condoning comments like that? #bcpoli #bced cc. @heathermaahs — BCTF (@bctf) December 15, 2017

Throness, an MLA since 2013, has reportedly endorsed Andrew Wilkinson in the ongoing leadership race to replace Christy Clark.

Once, his ancestors had owned the coal-seamed cavern that he was now descending into, his trainee miner hard-hat secure.

His people had settled the Clintwood and George's Fork area, along the Appalachian edge of southern Virginia, in the early 17th century. Around the turn of the 1900s, smooth-talking land agents from back east swept through the area, coaxing mountain people into selling the rights to the ground beneath them for cheap. One of Mullins' ancestors received 12 rifles and 13 hogs—one apiece for each of his children, plus a hog for himself—in exchange for the rights to land that has since produced billions of dollars worth of coal.

"I probably ended up mining a lot of that coal," says Mullins, a broad-shouldered, bearded 38-year-old with an easy smile.

There were other ironies to savor too. Mullins was a fifth-generation coal miner. But growing up in the 1990s, his father and uncles—all of them miners—begged him not to get into coal mining.

"No one wanted to see you in the mines," he says. "And they were all union miners too—had it good for a long time." Those protections were gone by the time Mullins was growing up. The US government's ongoing assault on organized labor through the 1980s and 1990s meant that the mammoth energy conglomerates that dominated the coal industry were free to open non-union mines with increasing impunity. But mining was still just as rough—replete with injuries, accidents, and black lung deaths.

During the coal bust in the 1990s, Mullins' dad was laid off from Bethlehem Steel's mines. Mullins recalls living off the green beans his family had diligently canned during the good times, and watching his parents grow desperate. Go to college, they urged him. Mining offered no future.

Mullins planned on following their advice. But he, like so many of his friends, family, and neighbors, soon found that the industry that has wreaked havoc on the economy of central Appalachia—composed of southwest Virginia, southern West Virginia, and eastern Kentucky—was also nearly impossible to escape.

Passing on the costs

Ask most Americans what they know about coal in central Appalachia, and they'll tell you it's a dying industry—one that US president Donald Trump famously vowed to revive during the 2016 election. "We're going to put those miners back to work. We're going to get those mines open ... I see over here a sign, it says 'Trump digs coal.' It's true. I do," he told a rally in Charleston, West Virginia, in May 2016. "You're going to be working your asses off."

AP Photo/Steve Helber "Trump digs coal" signs at a rally in Charleston, West Virginia.

But the idea that the region's coal industry is dying is not quite true. For much of the hundred-plus years of its existence, the industry has been on a kind of artificial life support, as state and federal governments have, directly and indirectly, subsidized coal companies to keep the industry afloat.

The costs of this subsidy aren't tallied on corporate or government balance sheets. The destruction of central Appalachia's economy, environment, social fabric and, ultimately, its people's health is, in a sense, hidden. But they're plain enough to see on a map. It could be lung cancer deaths you're looking at, or diabetes mortality. Or try opioid overdoses. Poverty. Welfare dependency. Chart virtually any measure of human struggle, and there it will be, just right of center on a map of the US—a distinct blotch. This odd cluster is consistently one of America's worst pockets of affliction.

A deeply cynical capitalist experiment has taken place, in which coal companies are kept profitable by passing on the costs they incur to the public.

At the root of these problems lies the ironic insight that struck Nick Mullins as he mined coal deep in the earth his family once owned. The extreme imbalance of land ownership in central Appalachia shifted the power over where and how Appalachians lived to corporations. The political and economic impotence of Appalachian residents that resulted has permitted a deeply cynical capitalist experiment to take place, in which coal companies are kept profitable by passing on the costs they incur to the public. The many ways in which politicians and coal barons have kept coal artificially cheap has, over the course of generations, devoured the potential of the area's residents, and that of their economy.

Central Appalachia's problems stem from its distinctive history. But the pattern of its struggles is not unique. Across America, obscure clusters of misery are growing in number and concentration—as people get sicker, poorer, and more isolated than they were just a few decades ago. Thus untangling the knotty problems of central Appalachia holds lessons for the rest of the country about how imbalances of wealth and power, created generations ago, can trap places and their people in the past.

The myth of coal jobs

The experiment underway in central Appalachia began with subsidizing coal by suppressing household wealth. To the local politicians who sponsored this strategy, the idea was that making conditions favorable to outside corporations would develop the local economy, creating jobs and enriching residents. How has that played out?

Not great, according to the most recent data from the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), the economic development partnership between federal, state, and local governments. Between 2011 and 2015, central Appalachia's median household income was just over $34,000—around 63% of what the typical American household earned. Fewer than 60% of working-age adults had jobs or were looking for work, compared with 77.4% at the national level. At 8.6%, the unemployment rate in central Appalachians is 1.7 percentage points higher that of the US. Nearly a quarter of its residents were in poverty, compared with 15.5% nationwide. Even more remarkably, the region fares much worse on all these measures when compared to Appalachia as a whole, a span of country that reaches from eastern Mississippi to upstate New York.

Throughout the last 125 or so years, West Virginia's economy and state budget has depended far more heavily on coal than Virginia and, to a lesser extent, Kentucky, making it a useful proxy for the socioeconomic trends associated with the region's coal-reliance. Though coal was first officially spotted in central Appalachia in the 1700s, major commercial production began in earnest only in the 1870s, after railroads finally burrowed through dense, rolling heave of the Cumberland mountains. Output grew exponentially. By the late 1910s, West Virginia was producing around 90 million tons of coal, and employing nearly 100,000 miners. US Steel's coal operation was West Virginia's biggest employer.

How things have changed: After peaking in 1940, at 140,000—around a third of the state's workforce—there are now only around 11,600 working miners in West Virginia. That's the lowest number of coal miners the state has had since 1890, equal to less than 2% of its workforce. It's very clear that coal has failed to create jobs. It is, however, still the only way that many West Virginians can earn a decent middle-class wage.

Nick Mullins' story illustrates that paradox—and how decades of subsidizing coal profits over investment in human capital and technology has led to a dearth of opportunities for young central Appalachians.

Attending a high school so underfunded that many teachers paid out of pocket to make copies of handouts, Mullins made the National Honors Society. But in eighth grade, an administrator had talked him out of taking the advanced-track classes, telling him his course load looked like too much work for him to handle. Not that he needed much of a push—those classes were filled with the coal-boss kids, who bullied anyone whose dad actually entered a mine.

"I wanted to be a proud, self-sacrificing guy who works two miles underground, where most people won't go, to provide for my family."

When Mullins asked his guidance counselor how to apply to college as a junior, she told him that, without having taken advanced classes, it was pointless. For the next few years, he bounced from southern Indiana to Knoxville and back to Virginia in search of a decent living, taking whatever work he could find—a Christmas temp gig in Wal-Mart's layaway department, carpentry jobs, night stockman at a grocery store, a janitor at a chemotherapy complex, clerk at Magic Mart. Nine jobs later, he finally caught a break, landing an $18,000-a-year technician position at a call center just opened by Crutchfield, a catalog and online consumer electronics retailer. After seven years, he was earning nearly $30,000. But with two kids now, and health care costs at $300 a month, he and his wife had nothing left each month to save.

As a trainee coal miner, Mullins could earn what he was making at Crutchfield—but with better health benefits and a retirement plan with matching. Despite the ebbing of union clout, coal jobs still offered a level of economic security unheard of in other industries. There really wasn't much choice to be made; just his family's fears to push aside.

Mullins talked himself into what he calls coal's "cult of self-worth," built around following his forbearers into hard, dangerous work. "I wanted to be a proud, self-sacrificing guy who works two miles underground, where most people won't go, to provide for my family," he says. Whenever he went into town, he made sure his "Deep Mine 26" ballcap was pulled snug over his head.

Coal's dominion has receded in West Virginia. Why, then, could Mullins find no well-paying work in central Appalachia except mining? Why has the structure of the central Appalachian economy changed so little?

Henry Hatfield's lament

Nearly 100 years ago, Henry Hatfield, who became the governor of West Virginia in 1913, predicted this contemporary dilemma. At the time, West Virginia was producing nearly 70 million tons of coal—a roughly 30-fold increase from 30 years prior. Coal was making West Virginia rich.

But Hatfield saw trouble ahead.

"Rich as we are as West Virginians in our natural resources," he said in his March 1913 inaugural address, "more than 80% of our fuel and raw material is utilized outside the state." As a result, he said, low prices fixed "a standard of wages for the miner that is an injustice to him, by reason of the long railroad haul to market."

Indeed, coal operators "extracted more work at less pay from mountain miners, and this substantially lowered their cost of production," writes historian Ronald Eller, professor emeritus at University of Kentucky, in his book, Miners, Millhands and Mountaineers.

The coalmine owners were able to do this because central Appalachian miners were mostly nonunion, unlike their fellow miners in Pennsylvania or the Midwest. "In those days, competition almost universally took the form of competitive wage cutting," wrote statistician Isador Lubin, the head of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics under president Franklin Roosevelt, in his 1928 book Wages and Cost of Coal. "The operator sold his men rather than his coal." The resulting boost to profitability "has tended to increase the development of the nonunion fields more rapidly than the country required."

Governor Hatfield dreamed that his state's endowment of coal would lead to local investment, fuelling factories, and enriching its economy. Instead, its resource wealth chugged out of the state by the train-load, along with the profits it generated.

West Virginia produced a lot. But it manufactured almost nothing. And that's still the case. Whereas US Steel once employed droves of West Virginians to gouge coal from inside mountains, for the last two decades, Wal-Mart has usually claimed the title of the state's biggest employer.

Since Adam Smith published his magnum opus The Wealth of Nations, capitalist societies have taken as faith that the key to prosperity is specializing in what they're naturally good at. Central Appalachia's economy seems to rest firmly on this logic. It has some of the finest-quality coal on the planet, and so it has sought to specialize in selling coal. Why, then, is it so much poorer in both wealth and well-being than the rest of the US?

Places with less economic complexity tend to grow more slowly and have much bigger gaps between rich and poor.

Perhaps our assumptions about the scale of "specialization" are too simplistic. A new field of research by Cesar A. Hidalgo, a statistical physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab, and Ricardo Hausmann, an economist at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, has begun probing that possibility by measuring areas' "economic complexity"—the mix of products a country makes. It turns out that places with less economic complexity tend to grow more slowly and have much bigger gaps between rich and poor, even after taking into account factors like income and education levels.

Why is economic complexity good? For one thing, the complexity and diversity of products made in a region tend to be a proxy for the knowledge and know-how of its workforce. This makes workers more valuable and gives them a broader range of career options, upping their bargaining power. By contrast, countries—or regions like Central Appalachia—that make relatively few things tend to constrain people's opportunities to learn new skills, whether on the job or at school.

The curse of weak institutions

Economic complexity illuminates one dimension of central Appalachia's struggles. Another source of insight comes from research by Daron Acemoglu, an MIT economist. In Why Nations Fail, which he co-wrote with University of Chicago political scientist James A. Robinson, the duo explore why some resource-rich nations are rich while others remain poor. They argue that the fate of a nation is determined in large part by its economic institutions—its financial systems, tax regimes, property rights laws, labor institutions, and markets, among other things.

When economic institutions are inclusive, they level the playing field among businesses, create competitive markets, encourage investment in new technologies, and enable people to acquire skills to pursue their talents, according to Acemoglu and Robinson. The institutions are underpinned by a political system that empowers a broad base of citizens to influence political decisions, preventing a single interest group from holding sway.

The fate of a nation is determined in large part by its economic institutions—its financial systems, tax regimes, property rights laws, and markets.

Extractive institutions, on the other hand, concentrate power among the few. This structure encourages the elite to warp institutions to enrich themselves and their political allies, which tightens their stranglehold on institutions all the more. "Different patterns of institutions today are deeply rooted in the past because once society gets organized in a particular way, this tends to persist," Acemoglu and Robinson write. While inclusive institutions drive "virtuous circles" of self-perpetuation, extractive ones fuel "vicious circles."

Natural resource wealth can amplify these dynamics. Places with weak institutions—Algeria or Nigeria, for instance—typically succumb to the "resource curse." Those with strong institutions, like the UK or Norway, tend to distribute that wealth more broadly.

The destructiveness of extractive institutions can be hard to discern when times are good. Even though wealth is unequally distributed, the majority of people tend to be buoyed by economic growth. The real trouble arises when growth falters. Instead of letting new sectors emerge to replace the struggling ones, the elite protect the old guard, a key source of their power and wealth. This thwarts creative destruction—the concept pioneered by economist Joseph Schumpeter to describe how the failure of inefficient enterprises frees up resources for more productive firms.

Though central Appalachia isn't a sovereign state, Acemoglu says that his and Robinson's framework applies to the region's long-run problems. He points to research done by economist Robert Tamura, of Clemson University, on the long-lasting effects of slavery on the economic development of the American South, as well as to analysis by Melissa Dell, a Harvard University economist, that shows how areas of Peru and Bolivia subjected to forced mining labor systems in the 16th through 19th centuries currently suffer from lower education levels and investment in public goods and services.

The vicious circles cementing central Appalachia's extractive institutions don't go back that far. But they do predate the region's coal boom by a century.

Land bonanza

Why has the coal industry been permitted so much free rein over central Appalachia, despite the obvious toll it has taken on Appalachian residents? For one thing, the people responsible for devastating the area don't actually have to live there and experience the consequences of their actions. By the time America won its independence, central Appalachia had already been carved into estates owned from afar.

The British crown and colonial authorities granted huge tracts to court favorites, Virginia planters, and eastern capitalists, according to historian Wilma Dunaway's book, The First American Frontier. From there, land accumulation by distant capitalists snowballed. In the 1790s, Virginia—followed by Kentucky—began selling cheap warrants for frontier land. By 1810, absentee investors owned around 93% of what's now West Virginia and at least three-quarters of eastern Kentucky, according to Dunaway.

Central Appalachia's extractive institutions allowed the region's natural wealth to be redistributed to shareholders in faraway metropolises.

It wasn't just far-flung fat cats cashing in. Local merchants, lawyers, judges, and politicians also snapped up land. Largely through control of state governments, this homegrown political and business aristocracy bent policy to enhance that land's value, says historian Lou Martin, history professor at Chatham University in Pittsburgh. "Central Appalachian states were anxious to get outside investment and took steps to protect capital, making taxes more favorable to large companies," he says.

After the railroads finally bore through central Appalachia's mountains, in the late 1800s, the coal industry followed a similar development path. At first, smaller coal operators abounded. But by the early 1900s, big, out-of-state companies gobbled up small, locally-owned companies, according to Eller, the University of Kentucky historian.

We typically think of "wealth redistribution" as shorthand for taxing corporations and the wealthy to give money to the poor. Central Appalachia's extractive institutions allowed exactly the reverse—for the region's natural wealth to be redistributed to shareholders in faraway metropolises, and in a sense, to America's emerging middle-class consumers who benefited from artificially cheap energy, at the expense of ordinary Appalachians.

Typically, tax policy would be used to offset the profiteering of absentee corporations. Not in central Appalachia. In 1902, West Virginia's state tax commission observed that coal "is being mined from and transported beyond the State, and continuously subtracted from the State's property values without paying to the State one cent of tribute." The report's author warned that "when wholly exhausted, nothing but a comparatively worthless shell will be left behind... the kernel having been removed without the requirement of contribution to the State's support."

Political bosses often doubled as coal operators, and "company men" were frequently elected to state senate.

Had West Virginia moved to change its tax system, it might have used coal companies' taxes to fund public investments that could have given residents more economic freedom and better quality of life. But supporters of the extractive regime were vastly more powerful. Political bosses often doubled as coal operators, and "company men" were frequently elected to state senate, typically serving as head of the mines and mining committee. Through the vast tentacles of its influence, the coal lobby tied up lawmakers' efforts to tax coal and pass mine safety laws, despite persistent efforts by Progressive politicians. Only in the 1970s did states pass laws that claimed any share of the earnings on coal extraction on behalf of their citizens.

But even with plum tax laws, central Appalachia's remote coalfields still couldn't easily compete with the coal mined in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois and elsewhere. To compete—and to reap profit—companies made their coal cheaper not only by suppressing miners' pay, but also their purchasing power and, therefore, their standard of living.

As demand for central Appalachian coal boomed in the late 1800s and early 1900s, displaced farmers and landless sons filled the new ranks of wage laborers entering the mines. To supplement their ranks, companies—sometimes using coercive tactics—recruited poor workers from the American South and even Europe. The region's population exploded.

With few existing settlements to house this new laboring class, the vast majority was housed in coal camps. A Senate report found that around four-fifths of West Virginia miners lived in company-owned coal camps, and more than two-thirds of Kentucky miners, according to Eller. That compares with 9% of miners in Indiana and Illinois.

This wasn't normal small-town America, or even something resembling other "company towns" around the country. All of these were privately-owned, privately-governed communities designed to give the mining companies maximum control not merely over mineral resources—but over human ones too.

Nada White's story

Nada White witnessed the power of the coal camps firsthand. Now in her late 60s, White is a medical assistant who lives with her son, Dustin, outside Charleston, the capital of West Virginia. Her early girlhood was spent with her parents on a farm in the family hollow, tucked up against the belly of Cook Mountain, in southern West Virginia, where ten generations of Cooks had grown up.

Those early days were spent swinging on mountain vines, collecting mollymoochee mushrooms in the spring, and picnicking in the glade where all the Cooks before her were buried. Then it came time to go to school, which was two hours away, longer in winter. However, the school bus came right to Wharton, a tiny town a few miles away, where her grandparents lived. So White moved in with them.

Back in the 1950s, her granddad did the same thing as all the other men in Wharton: he mined coal for Eastern Gas and Fuel. And like all the others, the Cooks' lived in one of the 50 or so houses that sat in a double row near the mouth of the hole in the hillside into which White's grandpa disappeared each day to gouge coal from the guts of the mountain.

Just as it had powered America's staggeringly swift industrialization during the previous 50 years, the tar-black ore that came out was now fueling America's postwar boom. At the edges of Appalachia, mighty factories churned out steel to make Fords and Chevys. The coal needed to smelt that steel came from Wharton and elsewhere in Boone County and throughout the central Appalachian region—as did much of the coal burned to power industry and the new Frigidaires and television sets filling the homes of America's burgeoning middle class.

The people of Wharton and other coal towns weren't part of this mass-consumption metamorphosis, however. One problem with town planning by plutocracy is that the coal camps suffered the ugliness of industrialization—disease, squalor, poverty. But it did not experience the benefits of a diversified economy and public services that typically accompany industrialization—affordable transportation, easy access to food and markets, job opportunities, newspapers, recreation.

Since they were privately owned, the camps enabled mining companies to govern not only production, but services and all means of consumption too: retail, recreation, education, medical care, worship, you name it. Each town was its own mini-monopoly—a phenomenon embodied in the company store.

Flouting state laws, mine operators forbade miners from shopping anywhere beside the company store.

Flouting state laws, mine operators forbade miners from shopping anywhere beside the company store. White's grandfather and the others didn't even earn the same kind of legal tender as factory workers in Pittsburgh and Toledo. He and the other miners were paid in little metal tokens notched in the middle and stamped with the Eastern logo. Scrip, it was called—and it could only be used in one place: the company store.

On payday, White's grandpa filed with everyone else into the Eastern company store to pocket a little mound of scrip, most of which he'd hand right back to pay for pinto beans, potatoes, rent, coal for home-heating, and any replacement mining gear he needed. (Workers supplied their own.) "Mostly you spent all your money on pinto beans and hoped your fridge didn't break," says White. The scrip system worked because there were no other stores. "There was just nowhere else to go."

Up and down the Chesapeake & Ohio rail line that rattled through Wharton two or three times a day were plenty of other small settlements—Robinhood, Twilight, Greenwood, Prenter. Each had its own company store too, but they wouldn't take Eastern's scrip. Those took only the scrip of Bethlehem Steel or Armco or whatever other coal company owned the town. And they were all overpriced.

"They could charge double or triple the price because they knew you had to come to the company store," says White.

"The greatest drain on the miners' wages was the company store," explained historian David Alan Corbin in Life, Work, and Rebellion in the Coal Fields. "Coercion, the scrip system, and the physical distance often combined to force the miners to deal at the company store, and through the monopolistic control of food and clothing and tools and powder, the coal companies were able to render wage rates and wage increases meaningless."

"Through the monopolistic control of food and clothing and tools and powder, the coal companies were able to render wage rates and wage increases meaningless."

Ordering from the catalogues of Montgomery Ward or Sears was much cheaper than the company store. That's where White's family got new shoes for school. But raising hard cash was tricky. The few folks with family tending farms in the hollows, like White's, sold chickens or eggs to raise money—or hogs when times got really tough. In the winter, White's dad also earned cash by driving coal around in his pickup, delivering it to families that needed it for heat (which few coal companies provided). Most people didn't have pickup trucks or chickens, though. This made it easy to fall into debt, which many of White's friends' families did.

There were other dangerous dependencies that were simply facts of life in Wharton. White recalls the day the four company men marched into the house next door, where Fred and Bobbie York lived, emptied all their things into the small soot-specked yard, and left. It was threatening to rain, and there sat Bobbie's piano. White, her grandmother, and Bobbie hauled it up onto the Cooks' porch, just missing the downpour. The Yorks gathered their damp belongings into a borrowed car and left. A week later, a new miner and his family moved in. White learned later that Fred's leg had been badly broken in the mines and Eastern was fed up waiting for it to heal. After a while, someone came for Bobbie's piano. Where the person took it, or what became of the Yorks, White never heard.

"You didn't want to talk bad against them—our whole existence depended on the coal companies."

The company could do that, of course, because Eastern owned the Yorks' house. They owned everyone's house, in fact—and everything else in Wharton from the church to the clinic, except the post office. There was no other employer. Those who complained found themselves not only jobless but blackballed, leaving them nowhere to work or live.

People kept themselves in line, and quiet, says White. "You didn't want to talk bad against them—our whole existence depended on the coal companies."

For hundreds of miles in any direction, almost all of the towns were privately owned, privately operated settlements almost all owned by companies like Eastern. There was only the faintest hint of public services—or, even, for that matter, representative government.

Mind you, by the 1950s, coal camps were comparatively comfortable compared to what they'd been like before the 1930s, when the passage of the National Labor Relations Act granted central Appalachian miners the right to organize.

Because coal companies owned most of central Appalachia's towns, "mine guards"—essentially private paramilitary forces—policed the region.

In the early decades of the 1900s, because coal companies owned most of central Appalachia's towns, "mine guards"—essentially private paramilitary forces—policed the region. These forces were broadly supported by the West Virginia government, which declared martial law four times in the early 1900s to put down miner strikes. (Facing a worker revolt that saw thousands of miners join together to oust a particularly brutal sheriff in Logan County, the governor went so far as to dispatch bomber planes.) Thanks to this system, southern West Virginia was home to some of the bloodiest fights in the history of America's labor movement.

To put it most simply, coal camps were economic institutions built to deny people agency. Of course, miners weren't slaves. But there were parallels. In a 1920s US Senate hearing, a Logan County miner named George Echols who had been fired for heading up the local union explained the combination of chronic underpayment, coercion, and violence prevalent in the coal camps. "I was raised a slave [in antebellum Virginia]," he told the committee. "My master and my mistress called me and I answered, and I know the time when I was a slave and I felt just like we feel now."

Much has changed since the 1950s. As federal labor laws improved the job security and wages of miners, rising electricity demand in the 1960s pulled the coal industry out of a postwar lull. Soaring oil prices resulting from the formation of OPEC a decade later spurred another coal boom.

At the same time, a lot hasn't changed at all.

The legacy of coal camps

"A manufacturing town may count upon a reasonable degree of permanency. A mining town in a region not suited to other industry is sure to have only a limited life," a 1923 Congressional report investigating coal-camp life explained. "It is this feature that differentiates the company-owned mining community from the company-owned manufacturing community."

That fatalistic approach to community planning seems to have played out in the coalfields. Through the coal slump of the 1950s and early 1960s, companies razed thousands of coal camp homes to cut their tax burden. Though some companies sold their land holdings, it was often to other big companies—not residents. Others continued charging existing occupants rent, refusing to sell. "I could go up and offer $100,000 for this house and they'd laugh in my face, even if I had it in $100 bills," a mine safety inspector living in a Logan County company house—whose roof had a gaping hole—told ARC in the late 1970s.

"For many Appalachian people, coal camp life is not a bygone era," said the 1980 ARC report. "Facing no alternative, people remain, often dependent upon the will and wishes of the company landlord. In staying, they face insecurities of tenure, dilapidated housing, and fear of the company's power."

As of 2013, of the 10 largest landowners in West Virginia, none is headquartered in the state, according to a 2013 study by historian Lou Martin and economists at the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. In six counties, the top ten landowners control at least half of private land. Five of those six—Mingo, Boone, Logan, Wyoming, and McDowell—are in the central Appalachian coalfields.

Jim Justice—who in 2016 ran and won West Virginia's governorship—is also the state's sole billionaire, and one of its bigger landlords.

The political power of coal hasn't faded either. As it happens, Jim Justice—who in 2016 ran and won West Virginia's governorship on the same "bring back coal jobs" promise as Trump—is also the state's sole billionaire, and one of its bigger landlords. At the time the WVCBP study was conducted, Justice owned 2% of McDowell County, as well as 2% of Greenbrier and 3% of Monroe counties. He also boasts a fortune invested in several Kentucky coal mines, timberlands in West Virginia, and a resort that has catered to coal barons for more than a century (and now fetes the New Orleans Saints).

This pattern of land ownership and extractive institutions, the legacy of policies set centuries ago—set the stage for a new way of passing on the costs of cheap coal to the public.

The tragedy of Buffalo Creek

Much of the mining in central Appalachia wouldn't be profitable if companies shouldered the true costs of this environmental blighting. Instead, companies pass those costs on to the public.

For one, there are the costs to human safety. Strip-mining and mountaintop removal have been linked with cataclysmic floods that, a few times a decade, destroy tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars in property. The worst floods have killed dozens or even scores of residents.

Though few today have heard of it, one of the ghastliest industrial disasters in US history took place in a coal camp-specked hollow in Logan County called Buffalo Creek. One rainy February morning in 1972, a dam holding 157 million gallons of coal waste gave out, sending a 15- to 20-foot tsunami of black gunk ripping through the hollow, according to Everything in Its Path, a study of the disaster by Kai Erikson, a Yale sociologist. The flood killed 125 people, damaging around $50 million in property (about $300 million in current dollars) and leaving four-fifths of residents homeless.

Pittston Coal Company—a Virginia-based company that owned the dam—claimed the dam's sole problem was that it was "incapable of holding the water God poured into it." But earthlier explanations exist. Raw coal must be bathed of impurities before being burned. Each day, Pittston's Buffalo Creek mines produced around 4,000 tons of market-ready coal and 1,000 tons of refuse. From the refuse, Pittston built dams to hold the 500,000 gallons of coal-dirtied water it ran through each day—an engineering feat that Appalachian writer Harry Caudill likened to "a pool of gravy in a mound of mashed potatoes."

Though the federal government had in 1969 outlawed this particular type of impoundment, state officials ignored both the law and local residents' complaints about the dam's shoddy state.

Pittston did eventually foot some of the bill for the Buffalo Creek disaster, settling a class-action lawsuit from residents for a total of $13.5 million (about $13,000 per person). The state sued Pittston for $100 million, half of which was to cover cleanup and damages. Then the extractive institutions swung into action. In 1977, then-governor Arch Moore settled with Pittston, accepting $1 million—less than a fifth of what West Virginia taxpayers spent on cleanup.

Moore wasn't alone in helping keep coal operators profitable in the face of soaring environmental costs—particularly as the easy-to-reach underground seams tapped out, and companies turned to strip-mining. States had passed laws overseeing strip-mining; however, these were so toothless and little enforced, notes Eller, that in both Kentucky and West Virginia, the practice increased after those laws' passage.

In 1977, the federal government finally weighed in. Paradoxically, though, the new law created an above-board way of shifting the astronomical costs of mountaintop removal's destruction onto taxpayers, with a devastating impact on the lives of central Appalachians.

The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act was supposed to require that mined land be restored to something approximating its original shape. However, a loophole in the law let coal companies ignore that expensive requirement if the reclaimed land could be put to "a higher and better use."

Coal companies instantly saw their opportunity, as Ron Eller recounts in his modern history of Appalachia, Uneven Ground. What if the now-flattened mountaintops they were creating could be pitched to government officials as a way to attract outside factories and create more jobs?

Higher and better use

Almost overnight, strip-mining underwent a hypertrophic mutation, as mining companies turned to blowing up mountain peaks and deploying hulking, 20-story machines to claw open coal seams below, replacing verdant ridges with moonscape mesas of lifelessness.

The land area of southern West Virginia scarred by active mountaintop removal leapt more than threefold between 1985 and 2005 and has stayed steady since then, according to GIS analysis by SkyTruth, an environmental nonprofit. As of 2015, some 8% of Boone County was being actively mined, compared with 2% in 1985. Today, the biggest mine sites exceed the island of Manhattan in size. It is impossible to restore the land to its former state. And the new law made it so they didn't have to try. A recent Duke University study found that coal companies had left the area they studied 40% flatter.

Mineral rights let coal companies tear off mountaintops—ruining the land permanently—to get at the coal beneath it.

The scale of environmental carnage is possible, at least in part, because of the land-grab legacy: corporate control of enormous land parcels has meant residents lack the legal clout to object. It's also been possible thanks to the signing away of mineral rights that happened in the late 1800s and early 1900s—that saw Nick Mullins' ancestor part with a hoard of coal wealth for 12 rifles and 13 hogs. This wasn't merely a matter of swindling farmers out of subsurface riches. Since mineral rights legally trumped surface rights, corporate ownership let coal companies clear cut forests for mine supports, build roads and railroad spurs, pollute and divert streams—all without having to pay taxes on the land they defaced, as Erikson explains. Strip-mining, however, pushed this bait-and-switch to a whole new level. Mineral rights let coal companies tear off mountaintops—ruining the land permanently—to get at the coal beneath it.

Then there are the costs that come with trying to find some higher and better use. Desperate to show they're creating jobs, local politicians have spent many millions in taxpayer funds recruiting out-of-state factories to the "flat land" created by mountaintop removal, according to Eller. Few have panned out. The region's manufacturing sector was about the same in 1992 as it was in 1967, according to a study commissioned by ARC. It still suffered from low wages, low productivity and over-reliance on branch plants. Meanwhile, a super-max penitentiary built atop a leveled mountain in Virginia struggles with a cracked foundation (the locals dubbed it "Sink-Sink"). Mingo County recently unveiled a new airport on one such dusty tableland; its major industrial park, which sits on a former mine site, remains mostly empty.

"Coal creates employment for some, wealth for a few, and sucks oxygen out of the room for the other people."

"There are lots more mountaintop removal sites than there ever will be airports or shopping centers," says Peter Hille, head of Mountain Association for Community Economic Development, or MACED, an economic development group in Kentucky. "Most of these sites are in places where it doesn't make any sense to build anything. Coal creates economic activity for a period of time but not development. It creates employment for some, wealth for a few, and sucks oxygen out of the room for the other people."

This spending might temporarily boost the area's GDP. But in the long run, that money isn't being spent on self-sustaining investments in upping the skills and knowledge of local workers and businesses. Lou Martin, the Chatham University historian, notes, "You can still see state governments worried about losing jobs and trying to help corporations, at times at the expense of employees and residents."

The false promise of more jobs

Despite the state support it's enjoyed, the shift to mountaintop removal hasn't created much in the way of jobs. They require far less labor than underground mines. For instance, coal employment in West Virginia fell by three-fifths between 1983 and 2000; 94% of those lost jobs were underground, according to research by Downstream Strategies, an environmental consulting group.

In fiscal year 2009, West Virginians paid a net $42.2 million to support coal companies.

Nowadays, taxpayers subsidize the coal industry directly too. In fiscal year 2009, West Virginians paid a net $42.2 million to support coal companies, according to a study (pdf) by WVCBP and Downstream Strategies, an environmental consulting firm. The report noted that "this value fails to capture the significant legacy costs resulting from past coal industry activity that have yet to be funded. These costs, which include damages to roads and bridges and funding needs for reclaiming all abandoned mine land and bond forfeiture coal mine sites in the state, amount to nearly $5 billion."

Even those data ignore the human toll, however.

As it happens, that is what finally convinced Mullins to leave coal mining behind. In the mid-2000s, a freak fire burned down his home. He and his family lost everything. But they gained a modest homeowners insurance check and some good advice—that maybe they should see the fire as an opportunity instead of a tragedy.

Roger May for Quartz Nick Mullins in Berea, Kentucky.

"My brother put it to me: 'Do you want to be a coal miner for the rest of your life?'" says Mullins. "All these things started weighing on me—I had a few run-ins with some of the management that month and realized exactly where we stood as people, as human beings, to the mining company. And I saw how they pitted us against each other and realized I couldn't stay on that path."

It took him about a month to quit his mining job. A year later, he and his family moved just outside of central Appalachian Kentucky, where he attended Berea College and finally got his degree. He now runs his own public relations firm aimed at bridging political and cultural divides surrounding Appalachian issues.

Greater economic opportunity was part of why they left. His biggest concern about staying, however, was their two kids. Eroded by dwindling budgets, local schools were even worse than when Mullins had attended them. He worried about his kids' health, too. Mountaintop removal sites and underground mines engirdle Clintwood, creating untold volumes of toxic waste buried in unnamed patches of ground. The backyard creek that ran past his house did so increasingly in Technicolor hues. That impetus to leave gained new urgency, however, when a public health scientist named Michael Hendryx began publishing his research.

Dark waters

Blowing off a mountaintop releases naturally occurring poisons like arsenic, selenium, lead, and manganese. These poisons then seep into streams and groundwater. Meanwhile, the blasting fogs the air with a toxic cocktail of dust that settles on roofs and windows in the valleys below, and cakes the lining of lungs. The displaced soil and vegetation from mountaintop removal is plowed into valleys, creating enormous detritus piles and choking off waterways.

Between 1985 and 2001, mining operations buried some 724 miles of rivers and streams, according to the EPA. And since 2002—when the George W. Bush administration redefined "fill material" in the Clean Water Act to include mining waste—the rubble plugging up central Appalachian waterways is laced with toxic muck.

For a decade now, peer-reviewed research produced by Hendryx, now a professor of applied health science at Indiana University, exposed a consistent link between mountaintop removal and a broad range of health problems and rising mortality rates. According to his research, since 1990—when amendments to the US Clean Air Act inadvertently stoked the growth of mountaintop removal (registration required)—parts of central Appalachia with mountaintop removal have had about 1,200 extra deaths per year, adjusting for age, smoking habits, and other factors.

Rates of birth defects are 26% higher in areas with mountaintop removal.

In addition to all-cause mortality, self-reported rates of some forms of cancer and mortality from diseases of the heart, lung, and kidneys are significantly higher in places with mountaintop removal, compared with places in Appalachia where it doesn't occur—even when adjusted for age, gender, smoking, work and family history. Rates of birth defects are 26% higher in areas with mountaintop removal than in the non-mining regions of central Appalachia. These findings are ominous because birth defect rates are unusually sensitive to exposure to toxic chemicals, even though the specific mechanisms are little understood.

Though it's hard to put a dollar sign on the human toll, Hendryx estimates that costs associated with the higher mortality of Appalachia's coal-mining regions between 1979 and 2005 totaled $50 billion a year (in 2005 dollars), compared with the $8 billion contributed by the coal industry in 2005. A 2011 study (registration required) put the health, environment, and other economic costs of coal-fired electricity at $345 billion, and possibly more than $500 billion, doubling—and possibly tripling—the costs of coal-generated electricity. "These and the more difficult to quantify externalities are borne by the general public," they write.

Despite the data, the effect of mountaintop removal on people's health remains a topic of much debate. The coal companies, unsurprisingly, dismiss Hendryx's research, as do a long roster of West Virginia politicians. Instead, you often hear that central Appalachians are sick because they're poor and because they make bad choices.

This is the way America commonly understands ill health and early death: that it's a matter of cigarette drags, cheeseburger bites, and other spasms of feeble character. It's true that, because towns were developed based on their proximity to coal mines rather than commercial centers, residential communities are often more than an hour's drive from grocery stores. Gas stop fare of buffalo wings and pepperoni rolls are the quick meal options available to most.

But part of coal's legacy in central Appalachia is that, as with their economic opportunities, individuals often don't have much control over whether they are healthy or not. Between drugs, poverty, social isolation, and lack of educational opportunities, there is any number of hazards that can derail, or even end, a person's life. With so many possible pitfalls, it's difficult to avoid encountering some.

The media and lawmakers are increasingly drawing connections between economic stagnation and destructive behaviors like opioid abuse and other "deaths of despair"—a term coined by Monnat and popularized by Nobel laureate economist Angus Deaton, which includes suicide and alcohol-associated liver disease as well as drug overdoses. And economically battered central Appalachia leads the pack. In 1999, rates of these "deaths of despair" among those aged 15-64 were the same inside and outside Appalachia, according to a recent report commissioned by ARC. By 2015, the combined mortality rate from these deaths was nearly 95 per 100,000 in central Appalachia, versus 49 per 100,000 in non-Appalachian US.

That's appalling, of course—but what might be even more disturbing is the larger context of that disparity. It's not just that central Appalachians are doing worse with opioids than everyone else. They're dying at higher rates from other causes too.

Between 2008 and 2014, heart disease killed nearly 250 people per 100,000 in central Appalachia.

Though mortality rates for most major causes of death have improved in the region since the late 1990s, they're still far higher than the rest of the country. Between 2008 and 2014, heart disease—the leading cause of death in the US—killed nearly 250 people per 100,000 in central Appalachia, 42% higher than the rest of the nation, according to ARC research. Cancer claimed 222 lives per 100,000 in the region, around a third more than the US as a whole. Rates for chronic pulmonary obstructive disease exceeded national rates by more than 80%; diabetes deaths were 40% higher.

They're also dying younger. Between 2011 and 2013, the nation averaged 6,658 "years of potential life lost"—the cumulative number of years a region loses per 100,000 people when its residents die before reaching age of 75, according to ARC. Central Appalachia lost 11,226 years of potential life.

But the words typed on a death certificate don't tell us much about the quality of people's lives. Central Appalachian residents also have higher rates of disability and chronic disease (pdf, p.86).

This may have something to do with the economic precariousness that is a fact of life in central Appalachia. A growing body of scientific evidence links "allostatic load"—basically, chronic wear and tear on the body caused by repeated triggering of stress hormones—with chronic disease and premature death. Many of the maladies strongly associated with allostatic load are problems in central Appalachia, such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. Allostatic load is also linked to depression and impaired mental functioning. Some scientists hypothesize that the system's inability to balance its brain chemistry caused by chronic stress may also encourage addiction.

Central Appalachia's brutally low living standards certainly bring with them plenty of stress. And the economic realities of the region mean that a sense of community, which might alleviate the effects of stress, is hard to come by.

Marlene Spaulding's story

Marlene Spaulding grew up in a Kentucky town called Beauty during the 1970s. "I'm not really sure there's a whole lot of beautiful there," she says.

The town was once known as Himlerville—the home of the first cooperative coal-mining company in the country. Founded in 1917 by Hungarian immigrants, each employee in Himler Coal Company owned company stock and received a share of its profits, according to Eller's Miners, Millhands, and Mountaineers. The houses in Himlerville were nice. Each had two fireplaces, gas and electricity, a tub and shower, and a vegetable garden, among other amenities. Miners could choose to buy their home or even build their own. Himlerville had a library, an auditorium, a modern school open 10 months out of the year, a local newspaper, as well as commercial developments that included a bank, a hotel and a bake shop. Miners elected by their fellow employees sat on the company's board of directors.

The company and the town prospered throughout most of the 1920s. But in 1928, private capitalists bought its assets. They renamed it Beauty a few years later.

By Spaulding's count, there are only two members of her extended family who have never been to prison.

By the time Spaulding was growing up in the town, life in Beauty was hard. Her biological mother was 14 when she gave birth to Spaulding and her twin sister, and a local family adopted the girls. Her adoptive mom came from a family with 18 children, her adoptive dad had 12 siblings. By her count, there are only two members of her extended family who have never been to prison.

Drugs were a big problem. Spaulding's older brother got hooked in high school, and was in prison before long. Back then, they let prisoners out on furlough over the weekends. Her brother would usually run off with his friends. Spaulding recalls awakening one night to her mom calming her as policemen filed into her room to search for her brother under her bed. "And that was normal to us," she says.

Roger May for Quartz Marlene Spaulding in front of Able Families in Kermit, West Virginia.

After a life spent shuttling in and out of prison, her brother died of cancer when he was 48. Six weeks before he died, police busted him for selling morphine "off his deathbed," as Spaulding puts it, most likely to exchange for something stronger. "One of the hardest parts about him is I really can't name anything good he did in his life," she says. "He never carried a job, never had a contributing role in society, was never a productive person."

But her childhood could have been much worse. As an adult, Spaulding tracked down a biological sister who had been born three years after Spaulding but hadn't been adopted. The two met up at the local Dairy Queen, where she learned that her biological sister had drug problems and was essentially homeless. At that moment, she happened to live eerily close by—beneath a bridge on the Tug River that Spaulding could see from her office window. "That very easily could have been me," says Spaulding.

Long before the rest of the nation noticed, the opioid crisis took root in central Appalachia. By 2015, West Virginia's rate of opioid-related overdose death for those aged 15-64 was more than three times higher than the non-Appalachian US, while Appalachian Kentucky's was more than twice the rate. McDowell County, in West Virignia's southern coalfields, has the highest opioid overdose rate in the country.

It's probably no coincidence that coal-mining towns emerged in the 1990s as the epicenter of the opioid crisis.

It's probably no coincidence that coal-mining towns emerged in the 1990s as the epicenter of the opioid crisis, says Shannon Monnat, sociology professor at Penn State University. Of course, injuries abound and surgery is common, leading to prescriptions for heavy-duty painkillers. To keep injured miners working—and from claiming disability insurance—some companies had doctors prescribing pain drugs on the job.

It's not just miners who rely on painkillers. Ask central Appalachian residents about addiction, and people will just as casually mention waitresses or hospital workers who dose themselves to keep their jobs. The 2008 ARC study reported that in coal country, women, unemployed people, and those whose households earned less than $35,000 a year were more likely to be admitted for substance abuse treatment in the coalfields than in other parts of Appalachia.

Part of the problem may be that high unemployment levels create a ready workforce of traffickers. Central Appalachians themselves will tell you that boredom has a lot to do with it: In a place where movie theaters, restaurants and skating rinks have mostly shuttered, recreational drug use doesn't have much to compete with.

Spaulding escaped opioids, but not teen pregnancy—another problem common in central Appalachia. Kentucky, along with West Virginia, has among the highest rates of teen birth in the country, concentrated in central Appalachian counties. "The day I walked through the [high school] graduation line, I already had a one-year-old," she says.

A few years later, she heard about a family wellbeing charity called Able Families, based in Mingo County, from another young mother. For a while, she participated in its programs, such as playgroups organized for mothers of young children. Then she was asked to join as a home-visit worker. Spaulding is now the director of Able Families, and is completing her masters in social work.

In addition to coaching mothers on childcare, Able Families sponsors an after-school program. It used to be that they'd prepare a light snack—until they realized it was often the child's last meal of the day, and raised money to provide hot meals. On the first day of the new meal program, Spaulding and her staff had planned to let the kids loose on the playground before the meal. But the kids weren't interested. "The first thing they got off the bus, they were at the fence like, 'Where's our food?'" More than a third of central Appalachian children live in poverty, compared with 21.7% nationwide, according to ARC.

The even bigger worry is that addicts with needy children aren't coming forward for help at all. "There's children starving over the weekend. And we don't know who they are," says Sandra Justice (no relation to the West Virginia governor), who works with Spaulding at Able Families.

"You go to the suboxone and methadone clinics, and you'll see pregnant women in line."

The problem could start even earlier, though. "You go to the suboxone and methadone clinics, and you'll see pregnant women in line," says Spaulding. The local hospital—where around two drug-dependent babies are born every hour—now has a separate nursery tailored to help infants to undergo the excruciating month-long withdrawal. The infants are treated with methadone, which relieves opioid-addiction symptoms but is itself a powerfully addictive narcotic.

It's not just material needs that local kids are missing out on. When the children put on performances, Able Families pulls out the stops to help parents and grandparents come to watch. It's hard to get anyone to come, though. Spaulding recalls an episode when, just as the children were about to take to the stage to begin a play they were putting on, she and her staff spied out the window one of the little boy's mothers driving up. The boy was excited, and the staff stalled while they waited for her.

But after a few moments, Spaulding saw the mother pull out again and drive off. She hadn't been parking to see the performance, but lining up at the drive-through pharmacy that abuts the Able Families lot. Getting painkillers, Spaulding suspects.

Graduation events are similarly crushing. At a recent junior high ceremony, besides them, only one mother and one grandmother showed up. "Can you imagine your life if no one ever does that for you?" says Spaulding.

"Thinking you could move away to a university—that's not even in the realm of possibility."

Spaulding's own daughter was one of only a few kids in her high school graduating class of 106 to leave the area. She graduated from Alice Lloyd College in Kentucky last year and now lives in Nashville, working as a paralegal. (She told her mother she would go anywhere that had at least one stoplight.) Her middle child has wanted to be a chef since early elementary school. She had to explain to him that, with no real restaurants in the area, he would have to leave too. This fall, he started in the culinary program at Fairmont State, West Virginia. "I don't think there's anything wrong if they wanted to live here," she says, "but I want them to know there's opportunity in other places."

Most kids in Kermit don't get to glimpse those kinds of opportunities. Driving the ancient white Able Families van along Route 52, Spaulding recounts a recent field trip to Cleveland she took with her students. For nearly all of them, the trip to Hard Rock Café was the first time they'd been to a sit-down restaurant. In fact, many had never before left Kermit.

Spaulding was worried that the kids would be bored and disruptive when they toured Case Western Reserve University. However, the campus proved dazzling and exotic—especially their visit to a dorm. "So I could live here?" one girl asked.

"I was thinking, well, probably not—this place is really expensive," Spaulding says. "But I told her, 'Yes, you could go to school here and this could be your room.' And they were all like, 'To live in?'" she says. "They come from where even a community college is mostly unheard of. Especially thinking you could move away to a university—that's not even in the realm of possibility."

In this kind of environment, it's perhaps unsurprising that residents of central Appalachia report feeling mentally unhealthy 25% more frequently than the average American. Nearly 20% of the area's Medicare beneficiaries suffer from depression, compared with just over 15% nationwide. In May, a metastudy found that social isolation upped a person's risk of dying by 29%.

Perhaps it's not simply the unhealthy habits and pollution endemic to central Appalachia that are sickening residents and killing them prematurely. Rather, the wear and tear on the body from prolonged social and economic stress could be making people far more vulnerable to their harmful effects.

The problem we're solving for

Nada White's son, Dustin, is now 34. He says that growing up in the 1990s, the most exciting event of the year was the Coal Festival of Boone County. The multi-day coal-themed carnival featured music acts, fireworks and tilt-a-whirls—a much bigger affair than the county fair.

Roger May for Quartz Nada White and Dustin White in Dawes, West Virginia.

Dustin's great- great-grandfathers would have looked forward to something very different. Back then, the biggest festival of the year in central Appalachia was election day—a state fair, market day, and political convention rolled into one, as Altina Waller, a University of Connecticut historian, recounts in Feud: Hatfields, McCoys and Social Change in Appalachia, 1860-1900. That disappeared in the coal camp era, as coal operators controlled political machines and, often enough, the votes of their employees. Nowadays, West Virginia frequently has the lowest voter turnout in the US: In 2008 and 2012, rates undershot the average by 11 percentage points.

Last year, however, that gap actually narrowed a little—shrinking to nine percentage points—thanks to enthusiasm for Trump. The central Appalachian coalfields were one of his biggest strongholds of support.

It's not hard to guess why. Trump promised to revive central Appalachia's coal jobs, a feat that would defy market trends. Central Appalachia's remaining seams are harder to get at, making the coal generated uncompetitive with that mined elsewhere in the US. Environmental regulations have lessened demand from coal plants, though the far bigger factor is the abundance of natural gas, which has undercut coal prices.

As a result, the region's coal industry is in the worst shape it's ever been. In the last few years, companies have been winding down operations—some by choice, and many by way of bankruptcy. But coal is still the best-paying job around, and in many towns, the only one. Bringing those jobs back, it's true, would save thousands of families and whole communities.

It turns out, Trump's campaign promises weren't just talk. In August, the Trump administration halted a comprehensive study, launched by the National Academy of Sciences in early 2017, to assess the health effects of mountaintop removal, citing cost concerns. Meanwhile, Trump appointed as head of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration a former CEO of a coal company with a record of repeated safety violations, including at a mine where a preventable accident killed a miner in 2011. His energy department is investigating ways to force utility companies to subsidize coal company profits, reported Slate in Oct. 2017.

Whether or not this will be enough to postpone the long overdue creative destruction of central Appalachia's coal industry remains to be seen. But for all the fanfare it's received, Trump's appeal to central Appalachians is neither original nor populist. It follows the same values and reasoning championed by a century of Appalachian politicians.

Trump, like generations of Appalachian politicians, says that he's trying to save coal for the sake of the people. But the problem that he's solving for isn't how to invest in making people healthier and better educated. Nor is it how to make their children's lives better or to expand their families' opportunities.

At a national level, US politicians, corporate chieftains and other civic leaders continue to ignore the flaws riddling their own growth model.

Rather, the problem Trump is intent on solving is how best to give vast, distant corporations more opportunities. To revive an old oligopoly, instead of innovating new work. To subsidize producing more coal, instead of spending on making the region's people more valuable. To stake the region's future on a finite resource, at the expense of the ultimate renewable one—human potential.

This isn't just a Trump thing. At a national level, US politicians, corporate chieftains and other civic leaders continue to ignore the flaws riddling their own growth model. Like the coal-backed politicians counting on boom to follow bust, the nation's leaders continue to expect the business cycle to buoy growth, failing to grasp how years of increasing inequality in wealth, income, opportunity, and health have cannibalized the very demand needed to sustain it. While they dither on investing in infrastructure, technology, education and health care, the country's reliance on welfare continues to climb as labor force participation slides. Taxpayers are subsidizing companies to underpay retail workers, just as they're paying for coal companies to lop off mountaintops.

And though central Appalachia's health and economic problems are unusually pronounced, the phenomenon certainly isn't anomalous. According to a recent county-by-county analysis by the Economic Innovation Group, a entrepreneur advocacy and policy group, the number of jobs and new businesses in distressed communities in the US—central Appalachia among them—haven't grown at all since 2000. Half have suffered net losses of both.

Meanwhile, two years ago, national life expectancy in the US fell for the first time in decades. It dropped again last year. It could be an anomaly—two years hardly makes a trend. But it could also mark a shift in its people's fortunes that is all but unthinkable in a country that has grown to be the world's richest and most powerful.

It's a blow that hit many central Appalachian counties a decade ago, the grim conclusion of the great cynical experiment played out upon its people. Americans, like central Appalachians, are told that problems of health and poverty stem from the moral failings of individuals, not of society. Meanwhile, their country's institutions are embracing the same ideology that laid waste to the coalfields—that profit equals prosperity, regardless of its true costs.Protection for undocumented immigrants, tougher gun laws, recreational marijuana: California will welcome 2018 by turning into the US equivalent of a Scandinavian country. Hundreds of new laws of markedly progressive inspiration will go into effect in the Golden State come the new year, affecting everything from crime, to transportation, to wages.

Immigration

Undocumented immigration is arguably the area that will see the most significant regulations in California, especially as the federal government attempts to curb it. Per new state laws, local authorities will be limited in their ability to cooperate with the federal government in sharing immigration status, and landlords can face civil penalties if they threaten to report their renters to federal immigration authorities. Agencies working with juveniles or developmentally disabled people won't have to report illegal immigration statuses. Further, workplace raids will need a warrant and workers will have to be given a 72 hour notice.

But changes won't be limited to laws affecting the immigrant population. Here are some of the most important in other realms (the Los Angeles Times provides a full breakdown):

Lifestyle

Come September, parents won't be required to list gender on their children's birth certificates.

Men will also have an easier time changing their kids' diapers, as many more public buildings will have to provide changing stations in men's restrooms, too.

Education

Schools won't be allowed to deny school lunch to children who can't afford it, and they will have to provide free tampons and sanitary supplies for students in grades six through 12.

Work

Companies with a staff of 26 or more will have to pay their employees at least $11 per hour, up from the current $10.50. In smaller companies, the minimum wage will be $10.50.

It will be illegal to ask prospective employees for their salary history, and equal pay laws will cover government jobs, too.

New parents working at companies of 20 or more employees will be able to take up to 12 weeks of parental leave: Those will be unpaid, but they won't lose their health coverage while away.

Personal finance

Refinancing a mortgage and other real-estate transactions will be subject to a $75 fee that will go towards low-income housing.

Weapons

School officials will no longer be allowed to carry concealed weapons on campus, and open carry of unloaded guns can now be forbidden by local authorities. Further, people will need to get a serial number if they intend to assemble their own gun.

Juveniles

Families will no longer have to pay fees for the handling of their children while in the juvenile justice system, and minors will no longer serve life sentences without parole.

Marijuana

Finally, people in California will be free to smoke marijuana recreationally. But not everyone will have easy (legitimate) access off the bat: Only a few cities will have retailers licensed to sell recreational pot initially.

Road etiquette

Commercial bus riders who do not wear a seatbelt might be fined up to $20. Further, drivers will be subject to a fine for smoking pot in their car when on a state road.

Beginning a road crossing while the signal is blinking will no longer be considered jaywalking.

Health

Antibiotics for animals will need prescriptions, and cleaning products will have to have clear labels for hazardous chemicals. Plus, AIDS will be treated like all other communicable diseases, and knowingly transmitting HIV will no longer be a felony.

Correction: Crossing while the signal is blinking will no longer get you a ticket in California.© World Chess Federation | Contact us: admin@fide.com | Developed and supported by Elista FIDE Office | Ratings questions: Elista FIDE OfficeIn September 2016, Mark Feigin posted five insulting comments on the Islamic Center of Southern California's Facebook page (before he was finally blocked by the ICSC from commenting):

"THE TERROR HIKE ... SOUNDS LIKE FUN" (written in response to the Center's "Sunset Hike" announcement).

"THE MORE MUSLIMS WE ALLOW INTO AMERICA THE MORE TERROR WE WILL SEE."

"PRACTICING ISLAM CAN SLOW OR EVEN REVERSE THE PROCESS OF HUMAN EVOLUTION."

"Islam is dangerous—fact: the more muslim savages we allow into america—the more terror we will see -this is a fact which is undeniable."

"Filthy muslim shit has no place in western civilization."

California is now prosecuting him for posting these comments, on the theory that they violate Cal. Penal Code § 653m(b):

Every person who, with intent to annoy or harass, makes repeated telephone calls or makes repeated contact by means of an electronic communication device ... to another person is ... guilty of a misdemeanor. Nothing in this subdivision shall apply to telephone calls or electronic contacts made in good faith or during the ordinary course and scope of business.

The posts, the California AG's office argues, were "were made with the specific intent to annoy and harass the members of the ICSC," because Feigin "was not trying to engage in any kind of political discussion but instead trying to vex members of the ICSC with his thoughts about their religion." The posts are criminal because they constitute "repeated harassment from those who wish to mock and disparage their religion," and, "[r]ather than attempt to engage in discussion or debate," are "cruel and pointedly aimed at dismissing an entire religion and those who practice it."

What could be more "intolerable" than for [the] ICSC Communications Director ... to check the ICSC's Facebook page and discover that someone has written "PRACTICING ISLAM CAN SLOW OR EVEN REVERSE THE PROCESS OF HUMAN EVOLUTION" as the Defendant in this case did .... Or how about ... "Filthy muslim shit has no place in western civilization." This is exactly the kind of repeated, annoying, and harassing electronic communication that PC 653m(b) is meant to deter. Protected speech? Political speech? Defendant's posts on the ICSC Facebook page are neither of those things.

And the government's argument makes clear that it's going after Feigin for the content—indeed the viewpoint—of his speech: "The mere content and nature of the posts establish that they are not made in 'good faith' as Defendant would suggest but are meant to annoy and harass." "Defendant is not seeking uriderstanding or guidance, instead he is posting in order to annoy and harass those who have beliefs with which he vehemently abhors." The Facebook's page public accessibility "does not translate into requiring ICSC or its members to sustain repeated harassment from those who wish to mock and disparage their religion." "Rather than attempt to engage in discussion or debate, Defendant's posts are cruel and pointedly aimed at dismissing an entire religion and those who practice it." Nor is the government's argument limited to vulgar epithets ("Filthy muslim shit"), though even those epithets are constitutionally protected when said outside the context of face-to-face "fighting words"; it applies just as much to the nonvulgar criticisms.

Of course, there's nothing in the government's logic that limits it to comments posted on the Islamic Center's page, or for that matter on the Catholic Church's page or the Westboro Baptist Church's page or the Church of Scientology's page. If the government is right, and the statute applies to posts on organizations' pages, then it would apply to any repeated harshly critical posts

on an NRA page "intended to annoy" NRA employees,

on a pro-Trump page "intended to annoy" its operators,

or on any other ideological organization's page.

The "during the ordinary course and scope of business" exception might exclude consumer complaints, but the government's theory is that this exception doesn't apply to this sort of criticism that is "cruel and pointedly aimed at dismissing an entire religion and those who practice it"—logic that would apply equally to criticism of political as well as religious ideologies. Nor can the courts constitutionally conclude that harsh insults of the NRA are "in good faith" and similar harsh insults of Islam are not.

This can't possibly be consistent with the First Amendment; indeed, in U.S. v. Popa (D.C. Cir. 1999), the D.C. Circuit set aside a telephone harassment conviction of someone who left seven racist messages on the voicemail of then-U.S.-Attorney Eric Holder; and the court focused on the "political message" of the speech, and not on Holder's status as a government official. Given that insults targeted to a particular person, related to a political message, are thus constitutionally protected, so are more general insults aimed at an ideology and all its adherents, whether that ideology is Islam, Scientology, conservatism, gun rights, or anything else. Laws aimed at preventing unwanted repeated messages to particular private citizens shouldn't be applied to messages sent to ideological organizations (or to public officials). And this is especially so when it comes to annoying Facebook posts, which the organization can simply block.

Caleb Mason at Brown White & Osborn LLP—which many of our readers may know as the firm at which Ken White (Popehat) is one of the partners—has filed motions to dismiss the charges; I hope the court indeed promptly throws them out as unjustified under the statute, forbidden by the First Amendment, or both. But if the courts accept such charges, expect to see many more people, left, right, and otherwise, prosecuted for posting insulting messages on many groups' web pages.

(I should note that Feigin is also being charged with making a threatening phone call to the Islamic Center; but that is a separate count, based on separate conduct, and it's far from clear that Feigin was actually the person who made that call, as this CNN story [Scott Glover] describes. The Center employee who received the call claimed that it sounded like Feigin's voice, which he heard when making a call to test the theory that the caller was the same person who wrote the Facebook posts. But the employee also continues to claim that the call sounded like the voice of someone who had left a different message on the Center's voice-mail the day before—and that person has been proved to be someone other than Feigin.

Nor do the police have any phone records linking the threatening call to Feigin: They waited seven months before trying to get the records, and by then Citrix, which operated the calling number as part of its GoToMeeting teleconferencing system, had purged its records. This is why this post focuses on the Facebook posts, which Feigin did make, and not on the separate threatening phone call charge.)As 2017 comes to a close, I want to highlight some of the year's best writing, reporting, and research on sex work. Traditional media is not known for its nuanced and accurate portrayals of erotic industries, but more than a few fair accounts managed to slip through the mainstream cracks this year, in the form of both commentary and original reporting. Meanwhile, sex-worker blogs, platforms like Medium, and indie press outlets have continued to allow current and former sex workers to tell their own stories. I hope the list below provides some idea of the awesome breadth of sex worker experiences in 2017, the outlets and writers capturing them, and the devastating toll that current cultural panic and government policy responses are taking on people in a range of "adult" occupations and circumstances.

"Surviving As Working Class After Backpage"

Most of this list comes in no particular order, but the top placement of this post from Kelly Michaels is quite intentional. It's the piece that has most stuck with me, out of a range of powerful contenders.

"In the last four months, I have been in the most unusual employment circumstances of my life," writes Michaels at the sex-work blog Tits and Sass. "I am kept in a small box with no access to even basic human needs like hot meals and showers. I am forced to stay there until my employers are ready to use me again. I am only permitted to shower when my employers are not using me. Up to a week in between showers has passed."

In "Surviving As Working Class After Backpage," Michaels details the way the criminalization of prostitution has closed so many outside opportunities for her and the degradation she now faces in "respectable" work as a cross-country truck driver.

"I am left now in a worse situation than I ever felt I was in as a sex worker," she writes. "I feel terribly exploited, and there is no 'Truckers Against Trafficking Truckers' to help me safely return to the freedom and independence of sex work."

In general, Tits and Sass—which offers its own best-of-2017 list here—is invaluable for interviews with sex workers' of all stripes about their work; highlighting sex-worker art and activism; reporting on policy that will affect sex workers; and publishing first-person accounts on aspects of the industry that most people rarely encounter. To get started, I recommend this August interview with SWOP Behind Bars organizer Alex Andrews; Jay St. James on how "Working While Pregnant Is About Survival"; and Caty Simon on the Department of Homeland Security's November raid of the Eros.com headquarters ("no matter what security measures we take, no matter how many layers of privilege might mitigate our gray market or black market status, at any point, criminalization can strip us of all of them and leave us economically and legally exposed").

"Why the Stripper Strike Is So Relevant and So Long Overdue"

"Public perception often shapes law and policy, and vice versa. Without legal precedent or social acceptance we become prey to shoddy business practices," writes "BlackHeaux" MF Akynos in an illuminating post on the origins and potential of the recent New York City stripper strike.

"An Arresting Gaze: How One New York Law Turns Women into Suspects"

In this August article, Vanity Fair magazine delves into the unfairness of New York's law against loitering for the purposes of prostitution. (For Georgia's version of the same, see "Profiling and Prostitution Pre-Crime.")

"Since 1976, New York Penal Law Section 240.37 has criminalized loitering in a public place by anyone the police determine is present for the purpose of prostitution," the magazine notes. But because of the law's vagueness, "the reason for one's presence is ultimately decided by the opinions of arresting officers." And "police officers make their decisions to arrest often through a strange sexualized gaze."

Reviewing New York Police Department arrest records for this offense, Vanity Fair found that "indications of prostitution" included things such as carrying money or "sexual paraphernalia," being someone known to have previous arrests for prostitution-related offenses, or wearing clothing such as "tight pants" or a "revealing blouse."

"We Are Kinda Unbreakable"

At the Baltimore City Paper, Raye Weigel takes an in-depth look at how transgender sex workers "remain resilient in Baltimore while navigating neighborhood associations, cops, gentrification, and more."

"Sex Workers Are Not a Life Hack for 'Helping' Sexual Predators"

In the wake of Louis CK's outing as a serial exhibitionary masturbator, many people commented that he should have hired someone to fulfill his "sick" fantasies, while lamenting what a "sad perv" or "creep" CK was revealed to be.

As if 'sad pervs' are the only people who want to masturbate in front of women. And as if sex workers are a quick fix who can and should cheerfully quell serially predatory men's desires, making them no longer a threat to decent society.

Alana Massey says nope on both accounts in this short November 2017 essay for Self magazine.

"How $40 Can Land You In Prison for Seven Years and On the Sex Offender Registry for Life"

At Truthout, Victoria Law tells the story of a former sex worker named LeeAnn, who spent seven years in federal prison after letting a teen girl use her apartment to meet a man for sex. The girl, who had told LeeAnn she was 17, "turned out to be 14 and, in the eyes of the federal government," LeeAnn's assistance constituted the crime of sex-trafficking of a minor.

It didn't matter that LeeAnn didn't know the girl's real age, nor "that LeeAnn, who was addicted to various drugs and also engaged in sex work, never made money from the girl's actions," notes Law.

Under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, the girl was considered a trafficking victim, and LeeAnn a trafficker. One year later, federal agents questioned LeeAnn. She was high at the time and doesn't remember much, but she does remember admitting to everything. "I didn't realize it was a federal offense," she told Truthout. "That's normal in that life." LeeAnn pled guilty and was sentenced to 87 months in federal prison, five years of probation and a lifetime on the sex offender registry.

A must-read for anyone who thinks that America's sex-trafficking prosecutions are actually about thwarting evildoers or protecting victims.

"The New Abolitionist Model"

Media reports on sex work, forced prostitution, and forced labor "routinely confuse or use all available terms," laments Laura Agustin in this December Jacobin review of The Pimping of Prostitution, the latest book from longtime anti-prostitution activist Julie Bindel.

Bindel's need to manifest indignation at the slightest deviance from a simplified ideology means readers get no distinctions between dastardly procurers, human rights groups, independent escorts, academic researchers, workers in massage parlors, and Hugh Hefner. We're all the same thing. It's the textbook definition of fundamentalism.

"ICE Is Using Prostitution Diversion Courts to Stalk Immigrants"

Melissa Gira Grant reports on how the Trump administration's persecution of immigrants has led to federal agents trolling "human-trafficking intervention courts" to stalk and intercept immigrant sex workers.

"City Attorney's Crackdown on Johns Has Dire Consequences for Immigrants"

The Stranger's Sydney Brownstone and Steven Hsieh explore yet another Seattle anti-prostitution effort that puts immigrant sex workers at greater risk—in the name of "helping" them, of course. (See also: "King County Cops Illegally Recorded Sex Stings.")

"How Working As An Escort Helped My PTSD" + "The Virtues of Unvirtuous Spaces"

"I am a trafficking survivor and a sex worker?—?both can and do exist in a single person at the very same time," writes Laura LeMoon in an essay on how working as an escort helped her deal with post-traumatic stress disorder and how online ads played a big role in this. "I had decided that this time I was going to engage in the sex industry by choice. It was a way for me to re-write my past trauma and reclaim my body for myself."

Far from the digital pimp it's often portrayed as, Backpage.com and the easy self-promotion opportunities it provided helped LeMoon take control of her work and her life after early abuse and exploitation in the sex trade.

Backpage gave me the ability to be contacted by clients and screen them in the ways that felt the most safe to me. Some sex workers I knew took client inquiries exclusively by email and demanded proof of employment and legal identification?—?demands that are all but impossible if you're hustling on the street to survive. BP was also extremely accessible—even for low income workers such as myself. Advertising prices were on a kind of sliding scale—$12 to see your ad regenerate at the top of the list for three days—that sort of thing. After I left BP, it was free for a while too. But more than anything, BP allowed me to have total control over my employment. Not being told what to do or forced to do anything I wasn't comfortable with was unprecedented and incredibly liberating considering the history I'd had in the sex industry.

"Sex Workers Keep Beer Hall Flowing"

This story from African Independent magazine is notable not only for the sex-worker victory it describes but also the positive and respectful tone it takes in doing so.

After threatening "to stage a week-long naked vigil" at the entrance to Zimbabwe's Chigarapasi beer hall, area sex workers succeeded in convincing local authorities to re-open the hall, which had been shut down earlier in the year. "The beer hall was built in 1960," the paper reports, and "became so popular and famous it attracted ladies of the night from across the country," including two women who were honored by town elders by having streets named after them. The beer hall's recent reopening "has livened up the night life in the town where prostitution is rife."

"We regard prostitution as a profession and we believe that one can make a living out of it," Maria Gura, a 60-year-old former sex worker, told the paper. "I have four children and among them one is now a medical doctor while the other is lecturer at a local university. I managed to send all these children to school using the money that I got from clients in this beer hall."

"At Sessions Hearing, The Business of Government Is ... Hysteria" + "Why a Mom's Facebook Warning About Human Traffickers Hurts Sex-Trafficked Kids"

The Los Angeles Times is just as likely to spread sex-trafficking hysteria as your next big-city paper. But at least two 2017 op-eds strove to question this hysteria, including one from Reason Editor-at-Large Matt Welch. In January, Welch noted that Sen. Dianne Feinstein started off her questioning of then-AG nominee Jeff Sessions by asking him about what she referred to as "the second largest criminal industry in this country": sex trafficking.

"In other words," wrote Welch, "the California senator wished to lead off her critical cross-examination of the nation's likely next top cop with a factually insane claim that will probably give him more power."

In an April op-ed, professional anti-trafficking activist Lara Powers cautioned that cartoonish, movie-villain ideas about traffickers—and the suburban-mom paranoia and social-media rumors they spawned—would work against victims.

I have encountered thousands of child sex-trafficking cases in the United States. I have never seen, read or heard about a real sex-trafficking situation in which a child was abducted by traffickers in broad daylight at a busy store under a mother's watchful eye. It's just not the way it works.

"Family, Former Attorney of Queens Woman Who Fell to Her Death in Vice Sting Say She Was Sexually Assaulted, Pressured to Become an Informant"

In November, a 38-year-old Queens sex worker fell four stories to her death, apparently in an effort to evade arrest by New York City cops. Emma Whitford, Melissa Gira Grant, and Rong Xiaoqing explore what was really going on with Yang Song, a Chinese immigrant who had told her family she was sexually assaulted by an undercover cop earlier in the year and was later pressured into becoming a confidential informant for them. She also faced charges for prostitution stemming from a vice sting where she worked.

Vice stings targeting so-called "massage parlors" exploded in recent years, primarily in Chinese immigrant neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn. According to a 2017 report from the Urban Institute and the Legal Aid Society, arrests of Asian-identified people in New York City charged with both unlicensed massage and prostitution increased by 2,700 percent between 2012 and 2016. Yang herself was arrested and charged with prostitution on September 27th, two months before her death, during a vice operation in the same building. That case was open when she fell, the next court date scheduled for December 1st.

For more on who NYPD targets for prostitution arrest, see this April 2017 paper from the Legal Aid Society's Exploitation Intervention Project (EIP), which "explores the background and needs of EIP clients, in addition to the challenges these clients face within the criminal legal system." Most "identified as cisgender female (93 percent) or transgender female (5 percent)", and clients were "overwhelmingly people of color," with 32 percent identifying Asian, predominantly of Chinese or Korean ethnicity. (For more on how federal agents are targeting Asian sex workers, see: "Deported for Giving a Handjob?" and "Feds Crack Down on New National Security Threat: Unliscened Massages.")

"The Indie Porn Stars Fighting for a Kinky Revolution"

"Progressive porn is taking off and it's proudly freaky, ethical, and queer," writes Alex King at Huck Magazine. But new U.K. legislation "threatens to whitewash the industry just as things are heating up." King's piece details how activists are fighting back.

"The Work in Sex Work"

In "The Work in Sex Work," Hennessy Williams explains how she started in sex work at 17 "because I owed a debt: not to a pimp, but to my college." Williams was told she had to pay several thousand dollars if she wanted to start classes the upcoming semester.

I didn't enter the industry because I thought it would be fun or easy or because I wanted to make a feminist statement: I did it because I was desperate for money. But I've also never considered myself a victim of trafficking, even if I've had to work with a couple of managers or pimps. It was my choice to work with them and it was my decision to leave when I did. I only felt exploited because my rights as a worker were so lacking. Sex trafficking is not a human rights issue. It is a labor issue. Elites refuse to see this because they refuse to recognize transactional sex as real work.

"Jon Ronson on Porn, Gender, and Sexual Humiliation"

Huck magazine's Megan Nolan interviews author Jon Ronson about "The Butterfly Effect," his podcast on the porn industry. It aims to investigate how Pornhub and other streaming sites changed the way people produce and consume porn, and the wide-ranging effects this has had.

"Tech people tend to be lionized and porn people tend to be dismissed," commented Ronson.

One way this is really evident is that if a porn star wants to take out a small business loan or even have a [checking] account, they'll get refused because they are porn stars – it's what banks call reputational risk. Whereas Fabian [Thyllman] wanted a loan to help him expand the empire that began with Pornhub, and because he was a male tech entrepreneur and not a porn star he got a 362 million dollar loan from a hedge fund. One of the things we show is that maybe these rich tech guys shouldn't be quite so lionized, and the people in porn, who are lovely, caring, kind, idiosyncratic, delightful people, shouldn't be stigmatized."

"Sex Workers In Alaska Say Cops Are Abusing Their Power to Solicit Sex Acts" + "Alaska Cops Fight for the Right to Sexually Exploit Prostitution Suspects"

"All 50 states allow police to engage in sexual contact with suspects," reported HuffPost in August. "In Alaska, they're fighting back." An impressive investigation into their fight from Jenavieve Hatch.

See also: "Alaska Cops Fight for the Right to Sexually Exploit Prostitution Suspects," in which Maggie McNeill writes here about the fight to end this practice in other states.

Every time reformers get a toehold, coverage tends to treat a state's policy or practice as an standalone case. Even when it isn't—as in this report on a similar informal policy in Fort Smith, Arkansas—reporters routinely accept the word of police department mouthpieces that such policies are both unusual and well-intentioned, and that most cops would never think of using them for nefarious purposes because sex workers are exploited 'victims' that they're trying to 'rescue.' These are not isolated incidents.

"Kamala Harris' Whorephobia Is Sadly No Surprise"

Melissa Petro attempts to calm the hype on "liberal hero" Kamala Harris and explains how Harris—former California attorney general and now a U.S. senator—"was an active force behind a campaign that endangered the lives of sex workers," making "it understandably difficult for people with experiences in the sex trades to throw her our support."

"Why We Should Decriminalize Prostitution" + "Sex Work Criminalization Is Barking Up the Wrong Tree"

"Prostitution is not necessarily something you want to bring up at your local feminist meeting, unless you're trying to start a war," wrote Linda Tirado in at The Daily Beast earlier this year. Tirado draws on her days working at a strip club to explain the degrading and unsafe conditions that sex workers face under criminalization, and how the impact of criminalizing prostitution "goes well beyond the damage to the people who find themselves working in the sex trade," since "the arrest, detention, and charging of women for what amounts to a moral sin—if a sin indeed it is—is costing the country millions of dollars that we simply can't afford."

See also: "Sex Work Criminalization Is Barking Up the Wrong Tree," from the June 2017 issue of the Archives of Sexual Behavior. Based on a presentation at the 2016 International Academy of Sex Research meeting, the paper pinpoints "a notable shift toward more repression and criminalization in sex work policies, in Europe and elsewhere."

This "so-called neo-abolitionism reduces sex work to trafficking, with increased policing and persecution as a result," author Ine Vanwesenbeek writes. But evidence shows that "criminalization is seriously at odds with human rights and public health principles," finds Vanwesenbeek.

It is concluded that sex work criminalization is barking up the wrong tree because it is fighting sex instead of crime and it is not offering any solution for the structural conditions that sex work (its ugly sides included) is rooted in. Sex work repression travels a dead-end street and holds no promises whatsoever for a better future. To fight poverty and gendered inequalities, the criminal justice system simply is not the right instrument.

"Funding Crunch Shuts Bank That Gave Hope to Mumbai's Sex Workers"

Australia's Sydney Morning Herald reports on the closing of Sangini, the first Indian bank set up to help sex workers save money. "The co-operative bank, which started in India's second largest red light district in 2007, offered fuss-free banking services to sex workers, collecting cash deposits from their doorsteps and even welcoming homeless girls to open savings accounts," notes the paper. The closure has left sex workers in a lurch and inhibited the bank workers' ability to intervene in cases of young girls being forced into brothels.

"Cracking Down on Craigslist Puts Sex Workers at Risk"

Daniel Pryor unpacks a new academic working paper finding that digital classified ads can help reduce violence against women and especially violence against female sex workers.

The paper—authored by Scott Cunningham, Gregory DeAngelo, and John Tripp—focuses on Craigslist: a similar platform to Backpage that included an 'Adult' ads section in the U.S. from 2002 until 2010, when it was also shut down due to mounting pressure from the government. By analyzing female homicide rates over time in U.S. cities after Craigslist introduced an 'Erotic Services' (ERS) section and comparing them to cities without such a section at the time, the researchers were able to estimate the effect of an ERS section on women's safety. They found that cities that got ERS saw their female homicide trend slide afterwards, averaging out to a rate 17.4% lower than control cities over the same period.

"Meet the Woman Who Could Decriminalize Sex Work in California" + "I'm a Sex Worker Asking California's 9th Circuit Court to Decriminalize Prostitution"

The Bay City Beacon profiles Maxine Doogan, founder of the Erotic Service Providers Legal, Educational, and Research Project (ESPLERP), and her organization's legal battle to decriminalize prostitution in California. The case is currently before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

The idea for a lawsuit came to Doogan while she was speaking with sex work activist Margo St. James... Doogan admits that the undertaking felt "huge and overwhelming," but began by looking into COYOTE v. Roberts, a lawsuit brought in Rhode Island to decriminalize sex work in that state. "Back then, the enforcement was primarily against women, not against men, so basically it was a gender discrimination lawsuit," said Doogan. The case was dismissed, but helped her understand what a lawsuit would look like in order to be considered."

See also "queer femme sex worker, mommy, podcaster, writer, and sex-education student" Elle Lynn Stanger at Medium urging the 9th Circuit to side with ESPLERP.

We don't have to look far back into history to recall what happens in America when you criminalize a vice. Prohibition did not stop people drinking, it just empowered organized crime and corrupt cops. Similarly, our War on Drugs targets already oppressed poor and racial minorities, without reducing the prevalence of crack on the streets or cocaine in night clubs. Keeping sex-for-pay illegal does not erase the natural, healthy biological need we all have for companionship, touch and arousal.

"Sex Workers Victimized by Violence Remembered at Philadelphia Vigil"

The Inquirer recently covered a vigil commemorating the 2017 International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers, in a piece that's surprisingly sex-work positive for a mainstream paper. "The vigil organizers were encouraged by the attendance of a surrogate for Philadelphia district attorney-elect Larry Krasner, T.J. Ghose, an instructor at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Social Policy and Practice," Inquirer writer Kathy Boccella notes.

Ghose said the incoming DA had pledged during his campaign to drastically reduce criminal prosecutions of sex workers as part of his goal to reduce the number of women of color behind bars. "Sex work is a gateway," said Ghose, who has worked with a 70,000-member union of sex workers in India. "If we're going to end mass incarceration, prosecuting sex workers has to stop."

"How to Be an Ally to Sex Workers"

Longtime sex-worker rights group COYOTE Rhode Island offers some important tips.Movements collapse when they become more interested in collecting heads than advancing their cause. Unfortunately, the very

worthy #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and abuse might have just reached that point.

Last week, #MeToo took down Pulitzer Prize-winner Stephen Henderson, the editorial page editor of the liberal Detroit Free Press (or Freep as it is called locally). Henderson was fired for "inappropriate behavior"—even though no women actively complained about it—that allegedly violated the newspaper's "zero tolerance policy." But if this standard—both too vague and too strict—is going to be religiously enforced on workplace interactions in the post-Harvey Weinstein era, few men—or, women, for that matter —will ever feel safe in their jobs.

Henderson is something of an icon in Michigan, where I live. He is a prolific writer and a popular media personality. I first became acquainted with him when I was a scribe at the Detroit News conservative editorial board in the mid-1990s and he on the liberal Freep board that he later headed. He also hosts Detroit Today for WDET, a local NPR affiliate, where he occasionally invites me to spar over ObamaCare and charter schools (on which we vehemently disagree) and discuss immigration reform and President Trump's draconian law-and-order agenda (on which we largely agree).

Henderson's travails began when he ran an editorial at the Freep calling on Democratic Rep. John Conyers to resign after credible allegations surfaced that not only had Conyers sexually harassed female staffers in his employ, but then used $27,000 in government funds to offer one a no-show job in exchange for dropping her complaint before the U.S. Congress Office of Compliance and signing a legal paper attesting that Conyers had done no wrong. Henderson's editorial incensed some of Conyers' local supporters, including Rev. W.J. Rideout III, a local firebrand, who accused Henderson of sexual harassment.

Rideout offered no names of victims or substantiation or details, which is why his own TV show has been indefinitely suspended for lacking "journalistic standards." Still, his allegations triggered an internal probe by the Freep. Henderson explained on his show subsequently that he "supported and encouraged" the investigation because he had nothing to hide. He says he racked his brain for every relevant interaction with his colleagues over the last 10 years and reported whatever he could think of "candidly and openly" to the investigators.

The Freep's fishing expedition eventually turned up two interactions that HR decided were inappropriate. Both occurred in social situations outside of the workplace. One involved a "sexually themed" conversation and another an interaction with someone who was his co-equal in another department. We don't know much more besides that. And while obviously some graphic or threatening "sexually themed" conversations with colleagues would indeed be grounds for termination, that really shouldn't be the case here. After all, neither woman, according to Henderson, ever filed a complaint against him or even wanted the company to take any action, a version of events that Freep and its parent company, Gannett, has not disputed. (Gannett declined to comment for this article, and a message left for the Freep publisher, Peter Bhatia, was not answered.) WDET has conducted its own investigation and come up empty, and is therefore not nixing Henderson's show.

There is still much we don't know about Henderson's situation. More may well come out. But as things stand, the flimsy accusations—and the process that led to their airing—make Henderson's firing seems like a massive overreaction.

Sexual harassment is a serious issue, especially in the workplace. All people deserve to have a comfortable work environment free from harassment. Many of the high-profile heads that have rolled since the #MeToo movement emerged clearly deserved their comeuppance, including, of course, Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, whose multi-decade, sexual predation triggered it all. So did actor Kevin Spacey (who is accused by 24 men, including a 14-year-old boy, of unwanted advances), NBC's Matt Lauer (who apparently had a button under his desk to automatically lock the door when he was propositioning co-workers), and PBS's Charlie Rose (who allegedly groped women and exposed himself to them). There were multiple victims and a clear pattern of extreme behavior in all these cases.

But the basis for the defenestration of others is much less clear. Celebrated humorist Garrison Keillor's popular show The Prairie Home Companion was axed by Minnesota Public Radio because Keillor put his hand on the bare back of a distraught woman whose shirt was loose, as he tells it. The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza was let go for "improper sexual conduct" that he claims consisted of a consensual relationship with a co-worker. But even in these cloudier cases, the women came forward and launched their complaints. That doesn't seem to be the case with Henderson. The Freep launched an investigation based on allegations by an unaffected outside party with a grudge—not any of the women involved. And the women who its investigation did finally fetch up, as best as one can tell, demanded no action against Henderson. It's no wonder that Henderson is now exploring a lawsuit.

All of this suggests that the climate of censoriousness that #MeToo has generated spooked the Freep so much that it wanted to take no chances. But there is something quasi-totalitarian when a company starts going after employees for victimless behavior that has been retroactively branded as inappropriate. It might also end up targeting women who engage in "sexually themed" conversations—replacing the fear of sexual harassment with that of HR inquisitions.

Henderson's plight is the clearest case yet of #MeTooism run amok. Jenna Wortham wrote in The New York Times that she is unperturbed by the excesses of the movement because she wants "every single man to be put on notice" and "feel vulnerable" just the way women do. But a movement that thoughtlessly and reflexively throws decent men under the bus will discredit itself and hurt its ability to take down the real abusers. That's a pity, because a responsible reckoning to hold genuine monsters accountable is something that women do indeed need.

This column was originally published in The Week.Time is such a basic property of our physical universe that it seems it would be easily and clearly defined scientifically in any physics model. Yet, on closer examination, time is a tricky property to pin down and delineate---and our "common sense" conceptions of time may not be as reliable as we would presume. Accordingly, a very big and outstanding question in science is: what is time?

Quantum mechanics and general relativity, the two predominant theories of modern physics, both agree that fundamentally there is no preferred direction of time---in quantum mechanics particle transformations and interactions look the same whether occurring "forwards" or "backwards" in time, a property known as time-reversal symmetry of microscopic laws of motion (part of CPT symmetry); and general relativity famously melds "past", "present", and "future" into one continuous spacetime manifold (the spacetime continuum).

With such ambiguity regarding the nature of time coming from our two pillars of modern physics theory, where then do we find a physical correlate for the preferred directionality of time that seems to be very much an observable and important way the universe works, at least within the macroscopic domain. The physics that describes the preferred directionality of time comes from the laws of thermodynamics, where the law of entropy (the description of the microscopic order of a system) produces the so-called thermodynamic arrow of time.

This notion is simple to understand: things go from being hot to being cold because heat flows to systems with lower temperature until equilibrium is achieved, and the same is true for pressure, particle concentrations, etc. Thus, it is observed that systems generally go towards equilibrium, what is often the lowest energy state and what often appears as the most disordered---hence the inevitable increase in entropy produces a definite directionality of time.

How then is this observable phenomenology of the law of thermodynamics reconciled with the microscopic time-reversal symmetry, or invariance under time reversal, of quantum mechanics? Boltzmann, originator of the epitomal Boltzmann's constant, offered a solution to the apparent paradox by noting that initial conditions break the time-reversal symmetry of otherwise reversible dynamics---a postulate that was recently confirmed quantitatively in experimentation with an electrical RC circuit.

Schematic of Experiment Schematic of the experimental setup pictured above. (A) Heat flows from the hot to the cold spin (at thermal contact) when both are initially uncorrelated. This corresponds to the standard thermodynamic arrow of time. For initially quantum correlated spins, heat is spontaneously transferred from the cold to the hot spin. The arrow of time is here reversed. (B) View of the magnetometer used in our NMR experiment. A superconducting magnet, producing a high intensity magnetic field (B0) in the longitudinal direction, is immersed in a thermally shielded vessel in liquid He, surrounded by liquid N in another vacuum separated chamber. The sample is placed at the center of the magnet within the radio frequency coil of the probe head inside a 5mm glass tube. (C) Experimental pulse sequence for the partial thermalization process.

A new experiment has now shown that the initial conditions not only break the time reversal symmetry, they also determine the direction of the arrow of time. As experimenters have recently discovered, the laws of thermodynamics always predicted one direction for the arrow of time because it was always assumed that in the initial starting condition there was no correlation among the components of a system. What the latest experiment has shown for the first time is that when there is correlation in interacting systems at the initial conditions the arrow of time can appear to go the opposite direction, or "backwards" in time. Thermodynamically, this equates to heat flowing from a cold system to a hot one, so that initially correlated systems a hot particle will get hotter.

The researchers explain that this does not violate the laws of thermodynamics because those laws do not address the role of correlation, and in fact assume that there is no correlation in the system. In addition to the assumption that the system is isolated, the "normal" increase of entropy of thermodynamic flow only holds true when there is no initial correlation of interacting systems.A new experiment has now shown that the initial conditions not only break the time reversal symmetry, they also determine the direction of the arrow of time.

Such results are highly confirmatory and supportive of the main theory put forward in the study by Haramein et al. in the Unified Spacememory Network publication, in which Haramein, Brown, and Dr. Val Baker explain that strong correlation, or entanglement, is an integral mechanism underlying the observed increase of order of the universe and its subsystems over time, particularly those ordering dynamics that lead to life and sentience. The very name, unified spacememory network, alludes to the fact that it is a description of the connectivity circuits of entangled or correlated systems that lead to time-symmetric interaction and a kind of communicative network and memory property of the quantum structure of spacetime.

The recent experiment represents a discovery of a veritable new phenomenon in science and should hold important implications for theories, such as the USN postulate of Haramein et al., and potential technological applications.

Article: Experiment shows that arrow of time is a relative concept, not an absolute oneVATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis in his year-end message said that 2017 had been marred by war, lies and injustice, and he urged people to take responsibility for their actions.

At his last public event of the year, an evening vespers service in St. Peter's Basilica, the pontiff said that humanity had "wasted and wounded" the year "in many ways with works of death, with lies and injustices".

While war was the most obvious sign of "unrepentant and absurd pride", many other transgressions had caused "human, social and environmental degradation".

"We must take responsibility for everything before God, our brothers and our creation," he said.

While the pope did not mention any specific events from 2017, he had made his voice heard on many of the world's biggest issues over the course of the year.

In April, Francis condemned the "unacceptable massacre" of innocent civilians in a chemical weapons attack in Syria. Just a month ago, he visited Myanmar, where more than 600,000 Muslim Rohingya people have been forced from their homes and into neighboring Bangladesh, speaking with authorities in an attempt to mitigate the crisis.

The pope also sought to encourage peace in Colombia during a trip in September and lobbied U.S. President Donald Trump to address climate change issues in May. Amid heightening tensions between North Korea and the West, Francis expressed concern about nuclear arsenals.

At the end of the service, Francis walked across St. Peter's Square, stopping to shake hands and pose for pictures, as he paid a brief visit to the life-size nativity set up outside.

I am going to run you through how I calculated the intrinsic value of T-Mobile US Inc ( NASDAQ:TMUS ) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. I will use the discounted cash flows (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple! Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model . If you are reading this and its not December 2017 then I highly recommend you check out the latest calculation for T-Mobile US by following the link below.

We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with we have to get estimates of the next five years of cash flows. For this I used the consensus of the analysts covering the stock, as you can see below. I then discount this to its value today and sum up the total to get the present value of these cash flows.

5-year cash flow forecast 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Levered FCF ($, Millions) $2,762.22 $3,462.40 $4,262.72 $5,821.00 $6,066.00 Source Analyst x11 Analyst x15 Analyst x6 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Present Value Discounted @ 8.49% $2,545.97 $2,941.48 $3,337.87 $4,201.21 $4,035.28 Present Value of 5-year Cash Flow (PVCF)= $17,062

We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after the five years. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of the GDP. In this case I have used the 10-year government bond rate (2.5%). In the same way as with the 5-year 'growth' period, we discount this to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.5%.

Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2021 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = $6,066 × (1 + 2.5%) ÷ (8.5% – 2.5%) = $103,184 Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r)5 = $103,184 / ( 1 + 8.5%)5 = $68,641

The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the cash flows, which in this case is $85,703. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. If the stock is an depositary receipt (represents a specified number of shares in a foreign corporation) or ADR then we use the equivalent number. This results in an intrinsic value of $103.01, which, compared to the current share price of $64.35, we find that T-Mobile US is quite good value at a 37.53% discount to what it is available for right now.

Important assumptions

I'd like to point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with my result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. Because we are looking at T-Mobile US as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighed average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation I've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.8. This is derived from the Bottom-Up Beta method based on comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Next Steps:

Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. What is the reason for the share price to differ from the intrinsic value? For TMUS, I've compiled three key aspects you should look at:

During the impact the liquid explosion spread over 6 floors which equals average 67.2 MJ/m2.

The towers were designed to handle a theoretical fire load of 220 MJ/m2/hour. The towers were constructed to handle this amount of energy, spread during 4 hours (cumulative 880 MJ/m2). When a fire becomes hot enough almost anything starts to burn, from paint to even aluminium. An average office contains 600 MJ/m2 combustible materials.

The kerosene must have burned in less than 2 minutes (estimation), meaning that the permissible fire load of the towers could have been exceeded during the time the kerosene caught fire over 6 floors. With a short fire load of maximum 2,000 MJ/m2, the overload would be approximately 920%, assuming that all the kerosene burned inside the towers. But since a part of the kerosene exploded outside the towers means that it was less. How much less?

The volume of the fire ball around tower 1 during the hit was approximately 2,3x106 m3. The fire ball could freely expand since the windows were already blown out. The total volume of the affected 6 floors was 9x104 m3. This means that around 5% of the kerosene burned inside the tower. Kerosene is so inflammable that it doesn't burn up slowly. The perimeter of the explosion shows that there was no 'place' inside the building to burn this amount of kerosene.

Because only 5% of the kerosene burned inside the towers, means that the fire load was not more than 240 MJ/m2 during less than 2 minutes. The towers were able to handle this amount of energy easily. They were designed on this fire load, not just for 2 minutes but during 4 hours.

The heat of the fire after the impact was no problem. A kerosene fire of a few minutes doesn't develop more heat than 600 °C - 700 °C (1110 °F - 1290 °F). The steel construction was coated with a heat resistant material, designed and applied to handle this heat for at least 4 hours. Whether the main structure at the height of impact was unaffected by this first heat burst is unsure, since the thermal isolation might have been damaged by the impact.

The kerosene was a spark that ignited a larger fire. Additionally, the blast of the liquid explosion blew away part of the combustible materials. That means it didn't took part in the fire.

The total energetic value of the kerosene was a fraction of the energy necessary to bring the main structure in the danger zone. The kerosene plays hardly a role in the energetic balance, besides being the igniter of a much more dangerous fire - a burning office of 600 to 700 °C.

The towers were designed to handle this heat and fire load. Although parts of the protective coating might have been damaged due to the impact, which made the main structure vulnerable for the heat that followed.This is a massive collaboration that I did with .

Friends, today I have two messages to share with you. The first is to introduce to you a new library for the Rust language that I have poured some of my tea-powered energy into, so that you may be informed of its purpose and design. The second is much more significant; that is, to discuss an attitude I have observed in general amongst the Rust community.

First, let me introduce to you cHTTP: a practical HTTP client for Rust. While the working description is, "The practical HTTP client that is fun to use", I do not wish you to take offense. I am not calling other HTTP clients in the Rust ecosystem impractical; the primary goal of cHTTP that should underline every design choice is practicality. As of this writing, the current version is only 0.1.x , so some design is subject to change as more work is done on the library.

What makes cHTTP practical? The obvious choice I made here is to use libcurl underneath the hood instead of using a pure Rust library like Hyper. I'll talk about some of the reasonings and implications behind this in a bit, but it really boils down to stability and features. libcurl is used by an enormous number of applications on many different platforms, and has been well tested and supported. Since libcurl is so great, I decided to wrap it in a nice, Rustic API that abstracts away some of libcurl's peculiarities and integrates it more with the Rust ecosystem.

The two things that cHTTP brings to the table that plain libcurl doesn't offer is integration with the budding http library, and streaming bodies that make use of the standard Read trait. Offering a streaming API is always a bit tricky, since you have to let the response body "borrow" the connection socket somehow so that you can read the body directly off of the socket. There's lots of different approaches to handling this. For example, Apache's robust HttpClient Java library uses a connection pooling approach. When you execute a request, the response takes control of the connection that it originated from. Closing the response entity returns the connection back to the pool.

cHTTP takes a similar approach to Apache's design. A Client actually holds a pool of libcurl handles. When making a request, the handle used is wrapped in a special Stream struct and returned as the response body. In order to facilitate a "pull"-based API, each curl "easy" handle has its own "multi" handle, which allows every read on the response to call curl_multi_perform() as necessary on just that easy handle. This still isn't quite ideal, as we lose libcurl's own smart connection pooling which requires using just one multi handle. Sharing a multi handle would require either using a mutex, or losing Send on the response.

Some other things I incorporated into the initial design:

Simple API for the simple use case: Just call chttp::get() for a one-off GET request.

for a one-off request. No requirement for background threads: it is your choice to use multiple threads or not.

Control over response buffering: You can consume response data at your own pace and choose whether to keep it in memory, write it to disk, or discard it.

If you are interested in seeing more of the API, you can check out the documentation if you like.

Now, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "What's the big deal with using Hyper?" That gets me into the second part of this post, in which I will say this:

Writing applications or libraries in pure Rust, in and of itself, is not a worthy goal.

This is unlikely to be a highly controversial statement. In fact, many of you reading may even be nodding your heads in agreement. Still, while I do not often see verbal disagreement, I do get the general sense amongst the community that a "pure Rust" solution is inherently better than, well, a non-"pure Rust" solution. Allow me to elaborate.

I concur that having a Rust-only codebase can lend itself certain advantages, which may include: less tooling required, easier package management, less runtime dependencies, or less unsafe blocks. If these were the advantages, and a mixed language solution offered no advantages, then I would say that pure Rust is always better. But that is rarely the case. When considering using some non-Rust library (usually C) in your Rust code, you have to weigh the benefits of pure Rust against the benefits that the library offers you. Sometimes it is worth using the library, sometimes it is not. There is no universally correct answer here; the right answer has to be chosen in a case-by-case manner.

One reason why libcurl is so popular is because of the trust it has earned with developers and businesses. It takes a lot more than some unit tests to prove reliability and earn trust. libcurl has been around for a long time, and is still actively developed and improved. There are other quality libraries out there as well that have stood the test of time. The language they were written in is not their primary selling point; the language is more about longevity and speaks to the time they were created in. The selling point is the code's quality, features, or reliability.

All I really ask is that we properly weigh the benefits and downsides of using external libraries. If there's a well-used, reliable C library out there that can solve your problem, then use it! I know that Rust offers a lot of benefits for program safety and correctness, but it isn't always necessary to rewrite a solution in Rust. I'm also not saying we shouldn't try to rewrite things, that's the fun of experimenting! Who knows, maybe something even better than existing solutions will come from it.

Note: Typically we talk about libraries written in C, and while C is undoubtedly the most prevalent language that most "native" libraries are written in, technically any language that can expose a C ABI can be used as well (like C++ or D).Choosing type sizes for a website can be daunting. Heading and paragraph sizes have drastic consequences over the layout and legibility of a page. Thankfully, we have modular scales to guide us.

A modular scale is a sequence of numbers that relate to one another in a meaningful way. Tim Brown, More Meaningful Typography

Modular scales are used in typography to create visual hierarchy and harmonious proportions. They provide a set of numbers to use as guidelines for font sizes and spacing.

A modular scale in typography

Implementing a modular scale in the context of the web typically involves manual calculation and hand-coding values in different places in your CSS. Extra care must be taken to maintain balanced proportions on all screen sizes.

We can take advantage of new CSS features to make it easier to design with modular scales in a responsive website. We'll start by using custom properties and calc() to dynamically compute the values for a modular scale. Then we'll change the scale based on viewport size, using media queries and the media() function.

Recommended: PostCSS and cssnext

In order to retain browser compatibility when using modern CSS syntax, I recommend using PostCSS with the cssnext plugin.

PostCSS is a JavaScript CSS parser that powers a variety of plugins that can transform your CSS. cssnext is a PostCSS plugin that transforms syntax and functions from CSS spec drafts into more compatible CSS.

A minimal postcss.config.js will look like this:

// postcss.config.js module . exports = { plugins : [ require ( 'postcss-cssnext' ), ], };

See the PostCSS documentation for instructions on how to integrate PostCSS with your preferred build tool (webpack, gulp, etc.).

Implementing a scale

Start by defining your fonts and type scale as custom properties. Use calc() to calculate varying powers of your chosen ratio. We'll use a ratio of 1.414 (the augmented fourth, in musical terms) for the following example.

A few guidelines regarding units:

Use percentages for base font sizes. Percent units respect the browser's text size setting. See CSS Font-Size: em vs. px vs. pt vs. percent for more information.

Percent units respect the browser's text size setting. See CSS Font-Size: em vs. px vs. pt vs. percent for more information. Use em units for heading sizes and spacing. em is a relative unit, so it scales according to the base font size. See Type Study: Sizing the Legible Letter to learn more about using em units.

We'll only style h1, h2, h3, p, and small in the following examples for brevity. If you make use of all the heading tags, you may need to define more steps in the scale.

: root { /* Font faces */ -- headerFont : 'Helvetica Neue' , sans-serif ; -- bodyFont : 'Georgia' , serif ; -- fontColor : hsla ( 0 , 0 % , 0 % , 0.8 ); -- lineHeight : 1.5 ; -- baseFontSize : 112.5 % ; /* 18px */ /* Type scale */ -- ratio : 1.414 ; /* Augmented fourth */ /* Each step of the scale is a power of --ratio */ -- stepUp1 : calc ( 1 em * var ( -- ratio )); -- stepUp2 : calc ( var ( -- stepUp1 ) * var ( -- ratio )); -- stepUp3 : calc ( var ( -- stepUp2 ) * var ( -- ratio )); -- stepDown1 : calc ( 1 em / var ( -- ratio )); }

You can then reference these variables when setting your base fonts.

html { font-size : var ( -- baseFontSize ); color : var ( -- fontColor ); line-height : var ( -- lineHeight ); font-family : var ( -- bodyFont ); } h1 , h2 , h3 { margin : var ( -- stepUp1 ) 0 0.5 em ; font-family : var ( -- headerFont ); line-height : 1.2 ; } h1 { font-size : var ( -- stepUp3 ); } h2 { font-size : var ( -- stepUp2 ); } h3 { font-size : var ( -- stepUp1 ); } small { font-size : var ( -- stepDown1 ); }

We get the following result:

See the Pen Type Scaling using cssnext by Steven Loria (@sloria) on CodePen.

The result looks okay, unless you are viewing this post on your phone...

Problems on mobile

The scale used above works well for wide screen viewing. However, a ratio that's appropriate for desktop or laptop viewing is unlikely to work on smaller screens.

Jason Pamental explains why:

As the screen size shrinks and fewer elements are visible, the relative scale between elements becomes exaggerated. Jason Pamental, A More Modern Scale for Web Typography

Consequently, we have disproportionately large headings on small screen sizes.

A modular scale for large screens will not work for smaller devices.

Making it responsive

On smaller viewports, there are fewer visual elements competing for attention. Therefore, we can reduce the base font size and have less contrast between heading sizes.

For our example, let's use the following values:

Screens smaller than 36em : base font size of 100% (16px), ratio of 1.2

: base font size of 100% (16px), ratio of 1.2 Screens between 36 em and 48em : base font size of 112.5% (18px), ratio of 1.2

: base font size of 112.5% (18px), ratio of 1.2 Screens larger than 48em: base font size of 112.5% (18px), ratio of 1.414

Use different scales and base font sizes for different viewports.

We'll go over two ways to implement the desired result. First, we'll use media queries. Then we'll use the media() function to make the code more concise.

Using media queries

Since we have two type scale ratios, we'll write two sets of variables: one for small and medium screens and one for large screens. We'll also define two base font sizes.

: root { /* Base sizes */ -- baseFontSizeSm : 100 % ; /* 16px */ -- baseFontSizeMd : 112.5 % ; /* 18px */ /* Type scale on smaller screens */ -- ratioSm : 1.2 ; /* Minor third */ -- stepUp1Sm : calc ( 1 em * var ( -- ratioSm )); -- stepUp2Sm : calc ( var ( -- stepUp1Sm ) * var ( -- ratioSm )); -- stepUp3Sm : calc ( var ( -- stepUp2Sm ) * var ( -- ratioSm )); -- stepDown1Sm : calc ( 1 em / var ( -- ratioSm )); /* Type scale on larger screens */ -- ratioLg : 1.414 ; /* Augmented fourth */ -- stepUp1Lg : calc ( 1 em * var ( -- ratioLg )); -- stepUp2Lg : calc ( var ( -- stepUp1Lg ) * var ( -- ratioLg )); -- stepUp3Lg : calc ( var ( -- stepUp2Lg ) * var ( -- ratioLg )); -- stepDown1Lg : calc ( 1 em / var ( -- ratioLg )); }

Next, we'll write the two break points to use in our media queries.

Use em units for media queries because they behave the most consistently across browsers. See PX, EM or REM Media Queries? for a comparison of the units.

We'll define our break points as custom media (another cssnext feature) so that we can refer to them by name.

cssnext allows you to use ">=" and "<=" in media queries, which are more readable than "min-" and "max-."

@ custom-media --break-md ( width >= 36em ) ; @ custom-media --break-lg ( width >= 48em ) ;

The base font size should increase at the "medium" break point.

html { font-size : var ( -- baseFontSizeSm ); color : var ( -- fontColor ); line-height : var ( -- lineHeight ); font-family : var ( -- bodyFont ); @media (--break-md) { font-size : var ( -- baseFontSizeMd ); } }

The ratio should increase at the "large" break point, so we refer to the large scale steps in our media queries.

h1 { font-size : var ( -- stepUp3Sm ); @media (--break-lg) { font-size : var ( -- stepUp3Lg ); } } h2 { font-size : var ( -- stepUp2Sm ); @media (--break-lg) { font-size : var ( -- stepUp2Lg ); } } h3 { font-size : var ( -- stepUp1Sm ); @media (--break-lg) { font-size : var ( -- stepUp1Lg ); } } small { font-size : var ( -- stepDown1Sm ); @media (--break-lg) { font-size : var ( -- stepDown1Lg ); } }

See the Pen Responsive modular scale using cssnext by Steven Loria (@sloria) on CodePen.

The font sizes properly adjust to the viewport size. Much better!

This approach is certainly more convenient than hand-calculating values for our scales, but it still requires at least one media query every time we refer to a step in the scale.

We can make the code even more concise with the media() function, which we'll dig into next.

Using the media() function

Rather than defining separate sets of variables for each modular scale, we can use the media() function (spec) to assign responsive values to our scale properties.

This feature requires the postcss-media-fn plugin in addition to cssnext. Install it with npm or yarn and add it to your postcss.config.js .

npm install postcss - media - fn

// postcss.config.js module . exports = { plugins : [ require ( 'postcss-cssnext' ), require ( 'postcss-media-fn' ), ], };

Use the media() function when defining your type scale variables. Each step of the scale combines the type scale calculations for each break point.

A step in our scale will look like this:

-- stepUp1 : media ( calc ( 1 em * var ( -- ratioSm )), ( min - width : 48 em ) calc ( 1 em * var ( -- ratioLg )) );

Let's break it down.

The default size for the first step of the scale is 1em × 1.2 (our smaller ratio).

× 1.2 (our smaller ratio). Beyond 48em (our "large" break point), the first step is 1em × 1.414 (our larger ratio).

Here is the full scale using media() :

: root { /* Break points */ -- minMd : 36 em ; -- minLg : 48 em ; /* Ratio on smaller screens */ -- ratioSm : 1.2 ; /* Minor third */ /* Ratio on larger screens */ -- ratioLg : 1.414 ; /* Augmented fourth */ /* Type scale */ -- stepUp1 : media ( calc ( 1 em * var ( -- ratioSm )), ( min - width : var ( -- minLg )) calc ( 1 em * var ( -- ratioLg )) ); -- stepUp2 : media ( calc ( 1 em * var ( -- ratioSm ) * var ( -- ratioSm )), ( min - width : var ( -- minLg )) calc ( 1 em * var ( -- ratioLg ) * var ( -- ratioLg )) ); -- stepUp3 : media ( calc ( 1 em * var ( -- ratioSm ) * var ( -- ratioSm ) * var ( -- ratioSm )), ( min - width : var ( -- minLg )) calc ( 1 em * var ( -- ratioLg ) * var ( -- ratioLg ) * var ( -- ratioLg )) ); -- stepDown1 : media ( calc ( 1 em / var ( -- ratioSm )), ( min - width : var ( -- minLg )) calc ( 1 em / var ( -- ratioLg )) ); }

With this setup, we no longer need to include media queries when referring to our scale.

h1 { font-size : var ( -- stepUp3 ); } h2 { font-size : var ( -- stepUp2 ); } h3 { font-size : var ( -- stepUp1 ); } small { font-size : var ( -- stepDown1 ); }

This approach requires a little more setup, but it results in tidier code when you use your scale in many places.

In summary...

Follow these guidelines when designing with modular type scales on the web:

In Ecuador, Año Viejo is a fiery tradition that symbolically burns up the failures, regrets and anger of the old year in order to usher in the hopes and resolutions of the new one. On the last day of the year, people construct effigies that might represent an irritating person, a disliked political figure, or even disappointment about past mistakes or unachieved goals. A handwritten note is pinned to the dummy explaining why it must be burned and what changes and improvements are desired for the coming year. Then, to a chorus of cheers and clapping, the effigy is thrown into the street and burned to ashes. Although the origins of this custom are murky, many believe it dates back to a particularly virulent yellow fever epidemic that required the mass burning of corpses.

When my wife and I were studying Spanish in Quito, we had an opportunity to participate in this custom. The teachers and students at our school teamed up to create an effigy. We collected old clothes for the body and stuffed it full of crumpled newspaper. We put a wooden dowel down its back so the dummy could face impending immolation with a stiff spine. A cottage industry existed on the streets for making expressive masks, and at only 99 cents per mask we choose this option. As our effigy neared completion, our teachers said that we students could benefit from an exorcism, and suggested that we confess our sins and promise better behavior for the new year.

I was elected to enumerate our failings and our resolutions. At the time I was frustrated with the laziness of many of the students in our school. And so, for them I wrote, "I was a bad student. I never studied much. I never did the homework that my professor gave me. I always spoke in my own language. For my sins my professors have decided to burn me up. I promise to be a good student in the next life!" We pinned our missive to the effigy and took him outside. As the flames claimed him, we laughed and said we would all try harder tomorrow.

Walking back to our apartment later that day, we encountered the smoldering remains of dozens of effigies in the streets. Laughter, cheering and honking horns were the sounds of the evening. Even the security guards in our building had an effigy they were saving for a midnight bonfire. As the new year approached, we realized the hopes and regrets expressed by the Ecuadorians were not so different from those of our own countrymen.If you had told Spurs fans that the North London club would finish 2017 in 5th place, 3 points above Burnley and 21 points off the league leaders, you would have been called crazy.

An apt way to describe Tottenham's form this season would be 'patchy'. From defeating giants of European football like Real Madrid, to tying against teams in the relegation zone, the Lilywhites have struggled to find consistency across domestic and continental fixtures. Much of this patchy form can be attributed to injuries – those of Toby Alderweireld and Victor Wanyama fundamentally alter Spurs' style of play for the worst.

With that said, successful transfers, players progressing in ability and others coming back from injury have all been amazing parts of the season. Davinson Sanchez has slotted in excellently, proving to be a phenomenal acquisition given the injury that Alderweireld is yet to recover from. Harry Winks' massive performances have made him the modern iteration of the youth revolution at Spurs but with Sissoko, Pochettino has shown that he can improve and motivate older players as well. The Frenchman is still one of the team's more technically limited players but he has become a solid option off the bench.

To top it all off, Erik Lamela – a castaway turned fan favorite – has returned from almost a year of sitting on the sidelines. He's a much needed attacking option and still exhibits a certain fire, a hunger, for the ball.

Lamela's return could not be timed better, as Spurs still struggle to break down teams that look to stifle attacks in the defensive third by packing the middle and marking the likes of Dele Alli, Christian Eriksen, and Harry Kane. The latter is in the form of his life, but it's clear that both Dele and Eriksen fade in and out of matches too often.

Being the prime conductors of our creative force, Tottenham's play suffers greatly when one or both of them have an off-game. The very fact that Eriksen is our only true #10 (an argument can be made for Lamela, but I'd argue the Argentinian is more like Son than the Danish maestro) is worrying within of itself.

Halfway through the season now, Pochettino and Levy might be tempted to turn to the January transfer window in order to bring in some needed reinforcements.

With new additions in Sanchez and Serge Aurier, and promising academy products like Kyle Walker-Peters, Tottenham's backline will see us through the end of the season at the very least. If Pochettino looks to bolster the team, he'll focus in the midfield and a creative player that can take some of the burden off Eriksen's shoulders.

It's telling that Dembele can hardly play more than 60 minutes in a match, and yet he is so massively talented that he remains an important gear in the Spurs machine. As mentioned earlier, Harry Winks has really stepped up his performances this season – but having a developing player and an injury prone player as your only solid rotation options in the midfield isn't ideal. Sissoko has been deployed there on occasion and although he boosts the middle of the pitch with pure physical power, he lacks the technical ability to properly bridge the gap between the middle and attacking third.

Interestingly, Spurs haven't been linked to many midfielders as of late, so it's possible that Pochettino & Co. don't see an issue with depth in that position. Still, if one of Dembele or Winks is sidelined for a substantial amount of time, it would severely dent the chances of having a successful season. With the absence of Wanyama, we've seen how much our defense suffers when our chief shield bearer is unavailable. I believe we'd see our attack suffer in a similar way if Winks or Dembele is injured.

The question is – who would come in that could bolster our depth? The time might be right to bring back Josh Onomah from his loan at Aston Villa. Having chalked up 19 appearances and 4 goals so far, he's had a great loan spell with the Villains.

But player movement, even something as relatively simple as recalling a player from a loan, can have unintended consequences. For one, Steve Bruce, the Villa manager, has deployed him as an attacking mid rather than an engine in the middle of the pitch. So it's completely possible that he's not suited to running a midfield in the top flight yet. Although he's shown capability in tracking back and intense energy levels, changing positions and receiving more responsibility requires a change of mindset. Which leads me to my second point – pulling him out of the squad he's been working with for 5 months now, with inherently different aspirations and chemistry, to drop him in the middle of a season where Spurs are desperate for silverware might be jarring.

From his performances, Onomah would provide a solid rotation option in the midfield, but I wonder if the move might do more to hinder him rather than keep him moving along in his career.

Of course, since Bruce has given him more starts in an offensive role, it's tempting to think that he can be the player that can lighten Eriksen's load. I don't think that's the case – we, frankly, need someone who can provide more than what Onomah can give now. Someone who isn't just a player that comes on in the 70th minute so Eriksen can rest, but a player who actually pushes for that starting eleven spot.

Recent rumors involve the likes of Everton's Ross Barkley and Bordeaux's exciting Brazilian attacker, Malcom. Barkley seems the more likely of the two but, having not played a single minute of football and just returning from an injury, it seems like more of a gamble than is necessary. With Chelsea getting into the mix as well, Pochettino has a bit of a time crunch to make a decision.

Admittedly, Malcom is the more exciting prospect of the two, and I believe he can rapidly develop into a proper player at Spurs. More on this on my next post, where I'll dive into what he can bring to Spurs.

These two gaps in depth are there for all to see – but the crux of the issue comes down to whether Spurs should do anything at all in the transfer window. Lack of competition for Eriksen and threadbare numbers in the midfield are pressing concerns, but are they so pressing that Pochettino simply must acquire new players in January?

I think the answer is no.

For one, players that hit the ground running after a January transfer are rare. A change of scenery, new colleagues, new system with new rules, and (potentially) a move to a different country, with a different language, with different customs all contribute to how rapidly a player can acclimatize to the new club. Pochettino's system is also notorious for placing great importance on pre-season. Luckily, we've been blessed with the likes of Sanchez and Aurier stepping in almost seamlessly, but for the most part it takes players a substantial amount of time to become contributors to the team.

Purchasing what would no doubt be an expensive player in the middle of the season without pre-season preparation would be a disservice to the player and potentially to the club.

Depth is needed – there's no argument there. But the smart play would be to consolidate the current team and identify realistic targets for the summer.Export/Download Printable Text (.txt) CSV Multiverse id (.txt) Markdown/Reddit MTGO (.dek) MTG Salvation

For the first time in his NHL career, he'd been traded and the result has been embracing an important role on a Penguins team still finding its way in an attempt to win a third consecutive Stanley Cup. First, he'll face his former team in Detroit with the Red Wings hosting the Penguins on New Year's Eve.



The Penguins center chatted with The Athletic's Craig Custance after Saturday's Penguins practice at Little Caesars Arena about the trade, his new team and comparing Henrik Zetterberg to Sidney Crosby:

But Crowdstrike founder Dmitry Alperovich didn't answer the Bell's question how his company was able to distinguish between hackers working for the FSB and those employed by the GRU.

The Bell doesn't know whether Mikhailov could have helped Alperovich reach that conclusion. But according to a source close to one of the defendants, Mikhailov passed on the information to Crowdstrike through an intermediary. The Bell could not confirm this claim.

Аs part of his job, Mikhailov had direct contact with foreign intelligence agencies and private cyber-security companies. Unlike many other law enforcement and intelligence services officials known in Russian as siloviki, he had been free to participate in various cyber-security conferences and events, two of his acquaintances said.

Two of Mikhailov's acquaintances say he shared information about Russian financially motivated hackers with his foreign counterparts. One source claims that Mikhailov did so on as many as 10 separate occasions — with Stoyanov, an old friend, often acting as an intermediary.

Many Russian hackers follow an unspoken rule not to engage in criminal activity "at home" in order to not give Russian authorities a pretext to detain them. At the same time, Russia is generally unwilling to extradite hackers. Mikhailov and Stoyanov would help foreign intelligence agencies with information in precisely such cases, the sources said.

Some cases of such cooperation are known: for example FSB's TsIB department, where Mikhailov worked, and the FBI worked together on the case against Roman Seleznev, the son of a State Duma deputy who is now serving a 27-year sentence in the U.S. for hacking into bank accounts. This is recorded in court documents in the case against Seleznev.

А tail was put on Mikhailov and his group by Russian intelligence around April, one of the sources close to them said. Another source close to a highly placed U.S. intelligence official confirmed that claim.

According to the Crowdstrike report, a second attack on the DNC took place in March. Eight months later, Mikhailov and his group were detained. And several weeks after that, right before the New Year, the outgoing Barack Obama administration leveled new sanctions against Russia. This time, they weren't connected to Russian meddling in Ukraine.The woman who defended Barbie will now serve as counsel for a very different, but equally well-known figure: Harvey Weinstein.

According to court documents obtained by The Blast, L.A. based attorney Phyllis Kupferstein filed a motion to represent Weinstein in a New York class action lawsuit filed by attorney Cris Armenta for six women who claim Weinstein and his company "colluded together to perpetuate and conceal Weinstein's widespread sexual harassment and assaults."

It's an interesting disparity ... Kupferstein's notable cases include representing none other than Barbie who, according to Mattel founder Ruth Handler, "always represented the fact that a woman has choices."

Back in 1999, Kupferstein defended Mattel in a massive class-action lawsuit that went on for over five years. The suit, which eventually settled out of court, was brought on by some doll collectors who claimed Mattel deceptively advertised certain Barbie dolls as limited editions.There are times when the audacity of the most political poll-testing opportunist on the planet reaches beyond stratospheric levels of comprehension. Cue the visual:

Arguably the most consequential failure of the Hillary State Department was in 2009 when the U.S. undermined the Iranian Green Revolution. Not only did the U.S. do nothing to help the opposition against the Iranian regime, but US funding was cut for democratic organizations/programs in Iran under Clinton's State Department. It was Hillary Clinton who supported the Mullahs in an ill-fated decision to achieve the ridiculous Iranian Nuclear Deal which she was just praising and defending three months ago.

Hello?

Meanwhile the mainstream media apparatus are refusing to even acknowledge the Iranian uprising; apparently because President Trump is supporting their cries for freedom.

Yes, if ever there was a bigger example of Trump Derangement Syndrome causing media to contort themselves into hypocritical pretzels, their reaction -or lack thereof- to these protests in Iran would stand as exhibit "A".

(Via BBC) [...] They are the biggest show of dissent since huge pro-reform rallies in 2009. There are reports of two deaths. There were calls for the removal or death of Iran's Supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in the cities of Khoramabad, Zanjan and Ahvaz. Iran's Islamic Revolutions Guards Corp is a powerful force with ties to the country's supreme leader, and is dedicated to preserving the country's Islamic system. (read more)

(Fox News, Stephen Miller writes) [...] CNN ignored the protests completely, and the explosion on social media until a front page story reporting on not uprisings against the regime, but a pro-government rally and President Trump's tweet in support of the protestors. If the State Department wants to send a message of solidarity to the protesters in Iran, perhaps it can send them a white truck. Yes, the question has to be asked how such an uprising of thousands against their government would be covered by western media if this were Tel Aviv. We don't need U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley defiantly raising her hand to answer that question for us.

The somewhat muted reaction to thousands of people rising up against the Iranian regime can and should be compared to the attention the Arab Spring received in 2010. The scenes coming out of Iran are just as dramatic, if not more so, than those of the Arab uprising.

A woman was caught on videotape screaming "death to Khamenei" at Iranian law enforcement officials – an action that could not only endanger her life, but the lives of her family. But nevertheless, she persisted.

Social media came to a halt when another video was shared on Twitter of a female activist, shedding her hijab and waving a makeshift flag at security forces while standing atop a container.

I'm not exactly sure why an Iranian woman would shed such a garment that we've been told by the political left of this country is a symbol of empowerment and feminism. But her body, her choice.

Protesters are shouting "Death to Khamenei," "Mullahs get lost," "No more Islamic Republic," "Clerics return us our country." They are not shouting "We have economic anxiety". This is not about economic anxiety. This about revolting against a regime who has exhausted its moral good will, and no longer can lean on a sympathetic United States for more pallets of cash.

AdvertisementsThe Trump White House has announced that it will not be sending military aid totaling $255 million to Pakistan.

The military aid was denied to the Pakistan government in response to what the Trump administration calls 'ineffective action against terrorists and militants on its soil.'

Trump's decision may end up pushing Pakistan further into China's orbit, as India remains torn between a BRICS new world order and American hegemony.

The Hindustan Times reports...

The Trump administration on Friday announced the United States will deny Pakistan military aid amounting to $255 million as it expects Islamabad to take decisive action "against terrorists and militants on its soil". "The United States does not plan to spend the $255 million in FY 2016 in Foreign Military Financing for Pakistan at this time," said a spokesperson of the President's National Security Council in a statement to Hindustan Times. "The President has made clear that the United States expects Pakistan to take decisive action against terrorists and militants on its soil, and that Pakistan's actions in support of the South Asia Strategy will ultimately determine the trajectory of our relationship, including future security assistance." "The Administration continues to review Pakistan's level of cooperation." The statement reflected and sealed the administration's complete disillusionment with Pakistan, which had sought to brazenly disregard the explicit warnings issued by President Donald Trump personally and leading members of his cabinet, such as secretaries James Mattis and Rex Tillerson. "This could be the severest blow dealt to Islamabad by this administration if it indeed decided to withhold it," said a leading US expert on Pakistan, who did not want to be identified. "There is more coming," the expert added.

If there's one thing I've learned about First Lady Melania Trump since her husband was elected president, it's that she can wear the hell out of a coat. Dramatic, functional, militaristic, sporty, tailored, avant garde—she covers a lot of ground with her coverings. She wears a coat so well, she doesn't even need to use the sleeves half the time, and she still rocks them better than most.

For the purposes of this list, I've eliminated blazers and skirt-suit jackets from consideration, even when they're really cool. Honorable mentions in that category go to this wild Altuzarra number she wore to meet the President and First Lady of Argentina, the bold choice of a Michael Kors tuxedo jacket for the Joint Session of Congress in January, and this gorgeous Ralph Lauren menswear look FLOTUS wore to host her Canadian counterpart, Sophie Trudeau.

But on to the big coats. And there are plenty. All the coats are posted at @1600slay under #FLOTUScoats.

28. Funky Fendi in Japan

This one fell flat for me, even though I like a crazy coat, and even this color palette. But something about the texture plus the colors plus the flowers was not doing it for me, leaving me with a $4,800 bathrobe feeling. This coat was FLOTUS' debut look on the couple's Asia trip, for her meeting with the First Lady of Japan.

27. Basic Black in Beijing

Melania kept her coat game very simple and chic in China in November, sporting this Dior number upon her arrival in the country.

26. Tale of Two Trenches

At Walter Reed Medical Center in April, FLOTUS donned a chic, simple trench coat.

25. Trench Twist

While visiting the Secret Service training center with the president in October, Melania bundled up in Burberry— a classic trench with python piping.

24. Celine with the Children

FLOTUS attended a Nicklaus Children's Health Care Foundation function at One World Trade Center in September, notably repeating a baby blue dress she'd worn in June. Draped over it was a white Celine coat.

23. Crimson on the World Stage

FLOTUS draped a Bottega Veneta red coat at the G20 in July.

https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse_Fash/status/883711195454341121

22. An Appointment in Tan

FLOTUS attended the nomination ceremony for Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen wearing a tan/cream-colored coat from Swedish designer, Acne Studios. She'd later wear another Acne jacket, featured later in this list, to visit Texas, but the look was overshadowed by her shoes.

21. Wild & Warm in Alaska

FLOTUS really needed to bundle up while visiting the troops in Alaska on the way back from her Asia trip. She chose a Ralph Lauren winter jacket.

https://twitter.com/summit_tiffany/status/929286338179985410

20. Church in Blue

In September, FLOTUS attended St. John's Church in Washington with the president, draping a light blue Joseph coat over her shoulders on her way to a service to mark the National Day of Prayer.

https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse_Fash/status/904405112411623424

19. A Royal Departure

FLOTUS departed for the couple's two-week Asia trip in November wearing a bright purple Emilio Pucci coat dress in her favorite silhouette paired with vibrant vibrant stilettos, also a staple. She'd wear these shoes again later in the trip with another purple stunner. Stay tuned.

https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse_Fash/status/926459648869269504

18. A Midwestern Lilac

FLOTUS wore a lavender Valentino coat with matching heels when she made a surprise visit to a Michigan middle school during Bullying Prevention Month in October.

https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse_Fash/status/922765038057852930

17. Olive Fab, not Drab

Melania sported a very military-inspired jacket to a youth center at Andrews Air Force Base in September, where she was promoting STEM eduction. The Veronica Beard look retails for $595.

https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse_Fash/status/908791880179228673

16. White for Women's Empowerment

Visiting the State Department and appearing at a White House women's empowerment event, FLOTUS wore an ivory, belted coatdress from The Row, a well-respected design housed founded by the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (no, really!).

15. Formal Coat Dress in Japan

For dinner with the First Couple of Japan, Melania wore an elegant, custom, tuxedo-inspired coat dress by her favorite designer, Herve Pierre.

14. Warm in Texas

When Melania visited Texas' rebuilding efforts in December, she wore a puffy Rag & Bone coat for the trip. It retails for about $995. This was the coat she wore for her famous Whataburger run with Second Lady Karen Pence. I may have awarded it extra points for that reason.

https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse_Fash/status/938772524644601856

13. When In Rome, As They Say

When FLOTUS stepped out in Sicily, Italy for her first foreign trip with the president for the G7 summit, she debuted in a coat that got lots of press, unfortunately more for its price tag than the look, as it is stunning. Her 3-D Dolce & Gabbana floral jacket runs $51,500.

Designer Stefano Gabbana is unabashed about his support for Trump and FLOTUS on his social media accounts, and criticism of that support led to one of the best fashion clapbacks of the year. D&G started selling a $245 "Boycott D&G" t-shirt when haters vowed to abandon the brand over it dressing Melania.

12. Not Your Momma's Tan Coat

I'm not generally a fan of the tan or camel coat, but I liked this version of it. This double-breasted Bottega Veneta was an extra treat for kids visiting the White House on Halloween.

11. Great in Black at the Great Wall

Melania wore several black coats on their Asia trip, and this wouldn't be my favorite except that it really decided to get into the spirit while FLOTUS was photographed on the Great Wall. Again, Melania drapes her coat instead of wearing it traditionally, and this $2,675 cashmere and wool coat took its moment in the spotlight.

@WhiteHouse_Fash While touring the Great Wall of China FLOTUS wore a D&G coat, the row skirt, Alaina Vienna Belt and Louboutin flats. pic.twitter.com/5EtJAySScW — Tiffany summit (@summit_tiffany) November 10, 2017

10. Reagan Red on the Runway

Early in the presidency, Melania was spotted in a gorgeous Alice Roi coat with military influence on top and flowy elegance on the bottom. Some suggested it was a nod to "Reagan" red and Nancy Reagan's ensembles of the same bright color. Looking at it again, I'm thinking this early entry from early spring of this year should be higher on the list. WANT.

Four Coats for Christmas

FLOTUS was out and about on the White House grounds overseeing ceremonies and decorations during the Christmas season as well as visiting a local hospital and the U.S. Marine Corps' Toys for Tots drive. She was rarely without a festive coat in her rounds.

9. Holiday Chic

At the lighting of the National Christmas tree, Melania wore a 2017 Chanel red, boucle coat with a plaid detail.

https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse_Fash/status/936389043360813056

8. Kelly Kween

While visiting the Toys for Tots charity drive, Melania opted out of her go-to formal look for a shorter kelly green Prada coat that retails for $1,488.

https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse_Fash/status/941234562901970944

7. FLOTUS also visited Washington Children's National Hospital

She read stories and greeted patients. She donned all white on the occasion, draping a Max Mara winter-white wool coat with a dramatic collar over a pencil skirt and sweater of the same hue. Kim Kardashian also favors Mara outerwear and has been spotted in this exact coat.

6. A Christmas Statement

And finally, while receiving a 19-foot evergreeen from Wisconsin for the Blue Room of the White House long with son Barron, FLOTUS wore a navy Calvin Klein coat with a red check to kick off Washington's official Christmas season. She paired it with knee-high Victoria Beckham boots and a red turtleneck. The coat retails for about $1,600.

Here is the Calvin Klein 205W39NYC coat, available at $1,597.50, I believe #FLOTUS is wearing https://t.co/GbY9AwgoWw pic.twitter.com/T9kBBAoWUU — White House Fashion (@WhiteHouse_Fash) November 20, 2017

5. Houston Bomber

It was Melania's Manolo Blahnik stilettos that got all the silly, hand-wringing press when she and President Trump left the White House to visit Houston in the wake of Hurricane Harvey (she was in flats by the time Air Force One landed). Overlooked was her casual jacket by Swedish designer, Acne Studios ($650).

4. Floral for a Fowl Pardoning

Melania often spices up her coat looks with interesting shapes or tailoring details over patterns, but when she goes for a pattern, she really goes for it. She paired this embroidered $975 Stella McCartney floral coat with a high-waisted leather skirt by the Herve Pierre, the designer who created her Inauguration gown, and rust-orange Victoria Beckham top.

https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse_Fash/status/933120028685357057

3. McQueen in Seoul

FLOTUS really enjoys a very tailored coat with militaristic details, and this was my favorite of the genre this year. Melania wore several black coats on her swing through Asia with Trump. Her choices in China were very subdued, as referenced earlier, but she let loose in South Korea. FLOTUS donned this double-breasted, cashmere Alexander McQueen coat with exaggerated shoulder details, paired with a dramatic leather belt to tour the National Cemetery in Seoul.

https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse_Fash/status/928258730973687808

2. The Inaugural Look

This one rides the line between blazer and coat, but as it was definitely an outdoor, cold-weather coat functionally, it's in the mix. And it has to be toward the top of the list, as such a great first-impression look, echoing Jackie Kennedy in robin's-egg blue, all designed by Ralph Lauren.

1. Delpozo in the East

Melania wore this dramatic, avant garde coat when she arrived in Seoul in November. The dark purple coat relies on architectural details like its large sleeves to make a statement, and FLOTUS paired it with none-too-quiet bright purple heels. For this look that very few can pull off convincingly, much less in a high-stakes and elegant setting such as greeting the First Lady of South Korea, I award this crazy coat the No. 1 slot on my list.

Feel free to argue with my ranking. That's the whole point! Thanks to @WhiteHouse-Fash, @MelaniaTrump.style, Vogue, AOL, and @flotus for pictures and tips. If I've missed any you remember, let me know!Osthryth was one of the few women mentioned by the Venerable Bede in his "Ecclesiastical History of the English People". She was born into a time of great strife. There was much tension and bad blood between the ruling houses of the various kingdoms in England before unification, especially between Mercia and Northumbria. It was also the era of the Christianization of the realm and there was conflict between Christians and pagans. She was married to a Mercian king, possibly in the hope of making an alliance.

We don't know when Osthryth was born but she came from royalty. She was a younger daughter of King Oswiu of Northumbria and his queen Eanflaed. She had two elder brothers Ecgfrith and Aelfwine and a sister Aelflaed. Oswiu was the brother of the revered saint King Oswald of Northumbria, whom Bede much admires in his "History". Oswald had been converted to Christianity.

King Oswald had come into conflict with the powerful pagan King Penda of Mercia. In 642, they clashed at the Battle of Maserfield where Oswald was killed and his body dismembered. Bede tells us that Oswald ended his life praying for the souls of his soldiers when he realized he was about to die. Upon his death, his brother Oswiu became king of the Bernicians as a vassal of King Penda of Mercia. In 655, Oswiu defeated and killed Penda at the Battle of Winwaed. Oswiu ended up dominating much of Britain until a revolt in Mercia established Penda's son Wulfhere as their king. When Oswiu died in 670, Osthryth's brother Ecgfrith succeeded his father as king.

When Wulfhere of Mercia died in 676, he was succeeded by his younger brother Aethelred. Somewhere during this time Osthryth married Aethelred. Aethelred may have been surprised by his succession to the throne of Mercia. He was the third son of Penda and most likely would have devoted himself to the church since he proved to be a pious and devout man. Osthryth and Aethelred were zealous in the promotion of Christianity in Mercia. The monastic house of Bardney in Lindsey was heavily endowed by the couple.

Bede tells us a story about Osthryth and the relics of her uncle King Oswald. Osthryth's father had retrieved Oswald's remains about a year after he died in battle. Sometime after 681, Osthryth wanted to translate the revered saint's relics and place them in her favorite abbey at Bardney. The Mercian monks of Bardney were sensitive and retained an aversion to the prior attempts by the Northumbrian kings to dominate them and refused to accept the bones of the saint even though they knew he was a holy man.

The carriage with the relics was stopped at the abbey gate in the evening and covered with a tent. During the night a shining pillar of light appeared over the carriage that shone up into the sky, bright enough to be seen throughout the kingdom of Lindsey. This proved the sanctity of the slain king. The monks who had refused the bones the day before began to pray that they be deposited among them and accepted them into the abbey. The bones were washed and placed in a sacred place. The water used to wash the bones was poured into the dirt in a corner of the sanctuary. Bede tells us later Queen Osthryth met with a holy abbess named Aethelhild and gave her some of this soil. Aethelhild took the holy soil back to her abbey and used it during an exorcism of a possessed man, curing him of his demons.

Despite the alliance of Osthryth and Aethelred, the two kingdoms of Northumbria and Mercia were in perpetual war against each other. Aethelred continued the feud by warring against Osthryth's brother Ecgfrith, who was defeated at the battle of the Trent in 679. Osthryth's brother Aelfwine was killed in this battle. Bede tells us Aelfwine was beloved in both kingdoms and there was so much grief over his death it nearly resulted in a blood feud between the Mercian and Northumbrian royal families. Peace was only reached with the intervention and mediation of Archbishop Theodore and appropriate compensation was paid.

Sometime before 697, it seems Osthryth had retired to her favorite monastery at Bardney and become a nun and Aethelred had married another woman. In a most unfortunate event, Osthryth was murdered by Mercian noblemen that same year. The reason for the murder is not divulged in the chronicles. The most likely explanation is a blood feud related to her involvement in the killing of her sister's husband King Peada of southern Mercia in 646. Osthryth was buried at Bardney. In 704, Aethelred abdicated this throne to his nephew Coenred and retired to Bardney where he was shorn as a monk, became an abbot and died in 716. It is unclear whether Aethelred's son named Ceolred was born to Osthryth or his second unnamed wife. Ceolred succeeded his cousin Coenred when he died in 709.

The Post reported that every Cabinet agency has seen their permanent staff numbers shrink under Trump, with the exception of the departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs and Interior.

The staff cuts represented a fulfillment of President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP divided over impeachment trial strategy Official testifies that Bolton had 'one-on-one meeting' with Trump over Ukraine aid Louisiana governor wins re-election MORE's campaign promise to make cuts in the federal bureaucracy and reverse former President Obama's hiring expansion.

Trump is set to announce new cuts as part of the 2019 budget, which is aimed at decreasing the deficit to pay for the recently passed GOP-backed tax law.

White House spokesman Raj Shah told the Post that the president "is committed to streamlining government for the 21st century, reducing bloat, duplication and waste, and focusing resources on key priorities like public safety and protecting our nation's homeland."

However, government workers have expressed anxiety over the cuts.

"Morale has never been lower," president of the National Treasury Employees Union Tony Reardon told the Post. "Government is making itself a lot less attractive as an employer."Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach said in a new interview that President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP divided over impeachment trial strategy Official testifies that Bolton had 'one-on-one meeting' with Trump over Ukraine aid Louisiana governor wins re-election MORE's election integrity panel has been unable to meet for months due to several lawsuits against the panel.

"Much of the past few months has been spent by commission staff answering discovery requests for information and drafting affidavits and things that like — going through the legwork of litigation, and that takes time," Kobach said, according to The Topeka Capital-Journal. "We have a very small staff in Washington, D.C., and that staff has been bogged down in litigation."

"I'm not aware of any presidential commission that has encountered so much litigation from special interest groups," he added.

As a result, the commission has not met since September, but will likely meet again in January, the Topeka Capital-Journal reported.

The commission has been a source of controversy since it was formed in May. Trump has repeatedly claimed without evidence that widespread voter fraud cost him the popular vote in the 2016 presidential election. Kobach, who has made similar claims, defends the panel by saying it seeks to find facts, not prove theories.

"There's never actually been a nationwide effort to look at the scope of voter fraud," Kobach told CNN in May. "Why wouldn't we want to collect as much data as possible?"

The Government Accountability Office announced in October it would investigate the commission's activities.

A Democratic member of the panel sued the commission in November, saying he was unable to access documents necessary to do his job.

Advocacy groups have filed a number of other lawsuits arguing the commission has itself violated the law, or violates voters' rights to privacy.

Kobach co-chairs the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity and is running for governor of Kansas.

— Updated 1:18 p.m."Fake news" and "covfefe" are among the phrases that made it onto one university's list of "banished words" this year.

Lake Superior State University released its 43rd annual "List of Words Banished from the Queen's English for Mis-use, Over-use and General Uselessness" on Sunday, including the two phrases tied to President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP divided over impeachment trial strategy Official testifies that Bolton had 'one-on-one meeting' with Trump over Ukraine aid Louisiana governor wins re-election MORE.

Suggestions were sent to the school before voters were able to select their favorites.

Lake Superior State spokesman John Shibley told The Associated Press that it made sense for the list to include the political phrases, considering the political climate of the past year.

"It wasn't as focused on politics in a very dirty sense," he told the AP. "Most of the nominations were well thought through ... considering how the year was."

Shibley said that "fake news" earned between 500 and 600 votes, but predicted that "covfefe" would be more of a fad word.

"Fake news" rose to prominence during Trump's campaign, when he began using the phrase to attack stories critical of him. He has continued to use the phrase during his administration.

The phrase was also listed as the second-most annoying word of the year by Americans in a Marist poll earlier this month.

"Covfefe" rose to prominence after Trump tweeted the phrase from his account in an apparent typo earlier this year.

He could become even more essential to passing President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP divided over impeachment trial strategy Official testifies that Bolton had 'one-on-one meeting' with Trump over Ukraine aid Louisiana governor wins re-election MORE's legislative agenda when the already-thin Republican majority narrows even further in 2018.

"The vice president does a lot of things that are invisible," said Joel Goldstein, a law professor at St. Louis University who studies the vice presidency. "Breaking a tie vote is visible. It's one of the most visible things the vice president does."

In visible contributions, it was a record-breaking 2017 for Pence. He broke a tied Senate vote more times — six — than any other vice president during their first year in office.

Pence was also the first vice president to use his tie-breaking power to confirm a nominee to the Cabinet.

Pence's first tie-breaking vote was Feb. 7, just weeks after inauguration, in the vote to confirm Trump nominee Betsy DeVos Elizabeth (Betsy) Dee DeVosDeVos forgives 1,500 student loans amid federal lawsuit Warren campaign launches 'a calculator for the billionaires' after Gates criticism Education Department finalizes new regulations to relax college-accreditation requirements MORE as secretary of Education.

Since then, he has cast five more tie-breaking votes.

Pence's office did not return a request for comment for this story.

Other vice presidents have averaged a little more than one tie-breaking vote per year. The last vice president, Joe Biden Joe BidenBudget official says he didn't know why military aid was delayed: report Growing 2020 field underscores Democratic divide READ: Foreign service officer Jennifer Williams' closed-door testimony from the House impeachment inquiry MORE, did not cast a single tie-breaking vote during his eight years in office.

John Calhoun, the vice president to President Andrew Jackson, cast the most tie-breaking votes of any other vice president, at 31, according to the Senate Historical Office.

Pence was able to make the difference for several Trump-backed agenda items, casting the deciding vote in favor of a tax-related amendment allowing money set aside in college savings plans to be used for other types of schooling; blocking new regulations allowing consumers to sue their banks; starting debate to roll back parts of Obamacare; overturning a rule that blocked states from withholding funding for Planned Parenthood; staring debate on that same rule and confirming DeVos.

Not everyone sees Pence's role as significant.

"Just about anybody can cast a deciding vote, I think vice presidents are more significant than that," said Ted Kaufman (D), a former Delaware senator and chief of staff to Biden during his time in the Senate.

Goldstein pointed out that Pence's ability to break a tie results from a unique combination of factors in the current Senate.

Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidThe Memo: Democrats confront prospect of long primary Bottom Line Lobbying world MORE (D-Nev.) in 2013 weakened the power of the filibuster, which was often used by the minority party to delay confirmation votes. He pushed through rules that reduced the number of votes required for Senate approval of executive and judicial nominees from 60 votes to 51 votes.

Republicans have also passed legislation this year under reconciliation rules that only require 51 votes. In a vote that requires more than a simple majority, no tie-breaker would be required.

Plus, a number of legislative items the Republicans tried to push through in 2017 only appealed to one party, so the GOP needed every vote to pass legislation without any Democratic support.

The vice president is technically the president of the Senate, which is largely a symbolic position until a tie occurs. Then, Senate rules allow for the vice president to cast a vote. That power has been mighty in Trump's young administration, while Republicans held a narrow 52-48 majority in the Senate.

"The combination of the changes in the filibuster rule, plus the fact that it was 52-48, and the fact that they were proceeding on a partisan basis so the available pool was really only 52 votes versus 100 votes was really all together what made the difference," Goldstein said.

The Republican majority in the Senate will narrow even further to 51-49 on Jan. 3, when Pence will swear in Democrat Doug Jones as the freshman senator from Alabama.

But Pence's importance as a tie-breaker in 2018 will depend on whether Republicans reach across the aisle, whether they can lock in support within their own party and the type of votes brought to the floor.

For example, there will likely be fewer controversial nominees in the second year of Trump's administration, compared to the first.

Still, Trump and the Republican Congress have an ambitious legislative slate heading into the new year, including infrastructure funding; a fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allows certain young immigrants to live and work in the United States; and possibly another run at cutting away at ObamaCare.

If Pence becomes even more indispensable in the Senate, it could affect his other responsibilities.

The vice president already had to delay a trip to Israel in December in order to preside over a vote on the GOP tax bill. Ultimately, Pence was not needed to break a tie on that legislation, which passed in a 51-48 vote.

"It's a significant thing about the vice presidency and it brings attention to Pence, but it's not as if he's really exercising any discretion or independent judgement," said Goldstein. "He's basically doing what the administration's line is to break the tie in its advantage. ... It's as if the Constitution now gives the administration a win whenever the Senate has a tied vote."Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen said on Sunday U.S. allies question the country's global commitment under President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP divided over impeachment trial strategy Official testifies that Bolton had 'one-on-one meeting' with Trump over Ukraine aid Louisiana governor wins re-election MORE while adversaries are able to take advantage of it.

The president has bucked the rest of the world on various international policies, such as the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord.

The president has also offered friendlier rhetoric toward countries that have been viewed as U.S. adversaries in the past, such as Russia.A few weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 with bipartisan support. The Act would allow persons eligible to carry a concealed firearm in their home state to carry in other states as well. Opponents contend that the Act violates federalism. Actually, the Act is well within congressional powers under the Fourteenth Amendment. That Amendment was enacted specifically to give Congress the power to act against state infringements of national civil rights.

Section one of the 14th Amendment forbids states to violate civil rights. Section five of the Amendment grants Congress "the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article." Enacted during Reconstruction, the Fourteenth Amendment was a remedy to ex-Confederate states denying freedmen the right to arms and other civil rights.

One of the civil rights protected by Concealed Carry Reciprocity is the right to interstate travel. It is "a virtually unconditional personal right, guaranteed by the Constitution to us all," the Supreme Court said in Sáenz v. Roe (1999). The Sáenz court explained that travelers have the "right to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than an unfriendly alien when temporarily present in the second state."

ADVERTISEMENT

Yet some states, such as New Jersey, do not allow nonresidents to apply for carry permits, and do not recognize permits issued by other states. The penalty for unlicensed carry is a mandatory sentence of at least 3.5 years in prison. New Jersey thus treats interstate travelers as unfriendly aliens.

New Jersey's policy is especially unfair because travelers are especially vulnerable to crime. Travelers, including tourists, often carry large sums of money, and may be unfamiliar with the area they are visiting, not necessarily knowing the safest routes to take when walking.

The Fourteenth Amendment grants Congress the power to enact a remedy against state mistreatment of interstate travelers.

Another national civil right that is protected by the Reciprocity Act is the Second Amendment right to bear arms. As the Supreme Court wrote in D.C. v. Heller (2008), "the inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right." Thus, the Amendment "guarantee[s] the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation."

Like other constitutional rights, the right protected by the Second Amendment is not limited to one's state of residence. The Fourteenth Amendment made the Second Amendment (and most of the rest of the Bill of Rights) directly enforceable against the states. Coloradans must be free to practice their religion in Utah. Ohioans' free speech must be protected in Michigan. North Dakotans must be free from unreasonable searches in South Dakota. And Idahoans' right to bear arms must be recognized in Oregon.

In Heller, the court suggested that concealed carry is not part of the Second Amendment right. The court cited with approval several nineteenth century state cases that upheld concealed carry bans because open carry was still lawful. However, some states make it nearly impossible for visitors to bear arms lawfully in any manner at all.

For example, Illinois prohibits open carry, does not honor concealed-carry permits from any other state, and allows residents of only four other states to apply for an Illinois permit—effectively prohibiting the residents of 45 states from bearing arms within its boundaries.

The opponents of the Reciprocity Act do not argue that the bill should protect open carry rather than concealed carry. The opponents prefer wholesale denial of the exercise of the right to bear arms in any manner.

In general, courts are deferential to the means that Congress chooses to exercise its Fourteenth Amendment powers against state intrusions on civil rights. As with similar congressional powers under the Thirteenth Amendment (banning slavery) and the Fifteenth Amendment (voting rights), Congress can prohibit state actions even when the Supreme Court has held that such actions are not per se violations of the Constitution. For example, the Supreme Court upheld literacy tests for voters, as long as the tests were administered fairly. Lassiter v. Northampton County (1959). Yet when Congress's Voting Rights Act of 1965 banned literacy tests, the court upheld Congress's discretionary exercise of its power. S.C. v. Katzenbach (1966).

Even if a court were to hold that the Reciprocity Act is not a proper enforcement of the Second Amendment, the Act would still be valid as enforcement of the right to interstate travel.

Moreover, the Reciprocity Act is also supported by the same jurisdictional predicate as many other federal gun control laws: namely, that the firearm in question was once sold or transported in interstate commerce. This is not really consistent with the original meaning of the Interstate Commerce Clause. But if the Reciprocity Act were held to exceed Congress's commerce powers, then much of the federal Gun Control Act would also be unconstitutional—such as laws that ban a person today from possessing a gun just because the gun was sold in interstate commerce four decades ago.

In short, whether you prefer that the Constitution be interpreted based on modern precedents, or based on original meaning, Congress has the discretion to pass the Reciprocity Act.

It approved the largest commercial sale of lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine since 2014 — a move that earned praise from both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill — and implemented sanctions targeting people in Russia for human rights abuses under a U.S. law some onlookers fretted the president might try to evade.



It increased the budget for the European Deterrence Initiative, an effort begun under former President Obama to bolster allies' defenses in response to Russian aggression, and deployed U.S. soldiers to Poland as part of a majority-U.S. NATO task force.

And it is poised to announce more sanctions against Russia, faced with a Jan. 29 deadline to name targets under a separate law grudgingly signed byover the summer.Even some Obama officials call the approach "mainstream.""The policy has been [in] continuity with the Obama administration post-2014, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine," said Daniel Fried, who under Obama served as the State Department's sanctions coordinator."I think the actual policies on the ground have been pretty good," said Fried, who also worked as a senior official on Russia issues during the Bush administration.But those policies have been obscured by the president's unusually warm rhetoric toward the Kremlin.In a speech earlier this month designed to roll out his national security strategy — a document that labels Russia a "revisionist" power and casts it as a fundamental competitor of the United States — Trump eschewed the tough language and said it was his desire to build a "great partnership" with Moscow. He recounted a phone call from Russian President Vladimir Putin thanking him for an intelligence tip as "the way it's supposed to work."Trump also discounts the intelligence community's assessment that Putin personally directed an influence campaign during the 2016 election to help install him in office. The Russian president has denied the charges and Trump has said that he "believe[s] that when he tells me that, he means it."Current officials dismissed the notion that there is any inconsistency between the president's attitude toward Russia and the administration's policies."If you look at the actions that we take, those are the things that ultimately matter. Those are the things that we're doing," an administration official told The Hill.The president's language is an important part of that broader strategy because it highlights "what we want our relationship to be," the official said. "I don't know anyone who works on Russia who would tell you it's not in our interests to have a good relationship with the Russians."But, the official continued, "We do have this two-pronged approach — we want to find areas of cooperation with them but at the same time we're not just going to stand by idly and let them run over us."In general, the official said, "the type of actions that you've seen are consistent" with the previous administration.In the early months of his presidency, speculation churned that Trump would back away from U.S. NATO commitments in the region, roll back Obama-era sanctions punishing Moscow for meddling in the 2016 election and return two diplomatic compounds widely believed to be a home base for Russian spies.But in reality, former diplomats say, the administration's concrete policies suggest a modest toughening against Russia.The European Deterrence budget increase was "a very big deal," according to Fried — and an apparent reversal of Trump's claims on the campaign trail that NATO was "obsolete."The lethal weapons sale to the Ukrainian army earned praise from lawmakers in both parties, as did the implementation of the congressionally-mandated Magnitsky Act sanctions, which Fried said was "a sound piece of work."And although the administration fiercely opposed the new set of sanctions passed by Congress in August — the administration official cited technical concerns — it appears poised to implement them by the end of next month."So far, if you read the interpretive guidance that State and Treasury have sent out, it's been solid," said Fried. "It has not felt, to me, like somebody was putting the brakes on."The administration has also declined so far to return the Russian diplomatic compounds, or dachas, seized by the Obama administration as part of a slate of penalties for its active measures campaign during the election.In that case, Congress has tied the administration's hands. The new sanctions law also prevents the administration from returning the compounds without congressional approval.Before that law was passed, the official said, the administration had "gone back and forth with the Russians on how to do this and they consistently turned down our different approaches." The official declined to offer specifics on what conditions the administration offered.Despite Trump's promises of a warmer relationship, U.S.-Russia relations have remained sour. The two governments have engaged in a tit-for-tat of forcing diplomatic closures and accusing each other of violating a 30-year-old arms control agreement.Earlier this week, Secretary of Statewrote in an op-ed that the U.S. has a "a poor relationship with a resurgent Russia."Critics say there are still soft spots in the administration's Russia policies — notably on Syria, where some say the U.S. has ceded influence to Moscow.Although the U.S. is pushing Russia to adhere to a November commitment made by Trump and Putin to resolve the conflict through the Geneva peace process, Russia is continuing to pursue negotiations along a separate track.The administration has also muted previous warnings to Russia about the role of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is backed by Moscow. And in July, Trump ended a covert CIA program to arm moderate Syrian rebels fighting against Assad — a move long sought by Russia.But the most significant hole critics see is in the administration's response to Russia's election meddling.Trump's new national security strategy takes aim at Russia for "undermining the legitimacy of democracies," but does not mention the U.S. election specifically.Many former officials believe that the Obama administration did not go far enough to counter the Russian campaign — and they think Trump is unlikely to establish a real deterrence strategy in advance of the 2018 midterms.The president has been infuriated by the federal investigation into the matter, which has led to the indictment of several senior campaign officials. He has fiercely denied any "collusion" with the Russian government and called the probe "the single greatest witch hunt in American political history.""Because it gets tied up in the president's mind with questioning the legitimacy of his election, I'm not sure we're going to be able to get there with this administration," said Steven Pifer, a former ambassador to Ukraine. "And I think that's unfortunate, because that will be an invitation to the Russians to continue what they have been doing."

The official who spoke to The Hill said that the administration is "actively working" on the issue.

"There's only one person I can say who will definitely win the election and has a superstar appeal in almost every state in the union, and that's Vice President Biden," Rendell said. "Of course, people say he's too old. But he's only a year and a half older than President Trump, and he's in infinitely better shape. I don't think age would be a factor in a Biden-Trump election."

"To me it's clear-cut — Joe Biden is our superstar. If he decides to run I think he will win overwhelmingly," he added.

Biden has become a frequent critic of Trump since his inauguration and many speculate he has his eyes on a presidential run. He has not officially thrown his hat in the ring, but has said he "may very well do it" if no one else runs that he thinks could win a general election.

But Rendell, who served as Pennsylvania's governor from 2003 to 2011, warned that the Democratic Party could alienate voters if they move too far left on the political spectrum, suggesting that it could drive right-wing Tea Party voters to turn out.

"What I think the nation is looking for," Rendell suggested, "is not left or right necessarily, but actual real answers to the problems and challenges that face us."In 2017, the Trump administration established dangerous new norms in environmental policy.

In just 10 months, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has devastated EPA by dismantling its science directives to protect public health and the environment. What will result from backing industry interests over defending public health for 300 million Americans? Only time will tell. Here is an inventory of the major investigations of Donald Trump Donald John TrumpGOP divided over impeachment trial strategy Official testifies that Bolton had 'one-on-one meeting' with Trump over Ukraine aid Louisiana governor wins re-election MORE's EPA expected to come to fruition in 2018.

Administrator Scott Pruitt is one of several Trump cabinet members (including Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkeOvernight Energy: House Science Committee hits EPA with subpoenas | California sues EPA over Trump revoking emissions waiver | Interior disbands board that floated privatization at national parks Interior disbands advisory board that floated privatization at national parks Overnight Energy: Senate eyes nixing 'forever chemicals' fix from defense bill | Former Obama EPA chief named CEO of green group | Senate reviews Interior, FERC nominees criticized on ethics MORE, Energy Secretary Rick Perry Rick PerryHighly irregular: Rudy, the president, and a venture in Ukraine White House releases rough transcript of early Trump-Ukraine call minutes before impeachment hearing Overnight Energy: Perry replacement faces Ukraine questions at hearing | Dem chair demands answers over land agency's relocation | Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders unveil 0B Green New Deal public housing plan MORE and former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price Thomas (Tom) Edmunds PriceOvernight Health Care — Presented by Partnership for America's Health Care Future — Warren faces tough choices on 'Medicare for All' funding | Dems demand answers on Tom Price's charter flights | Medicaid expansion nears 2020 ballot in Oklahoma Senate Democrats demand answers on payment for Tom Price's charter flights Industrial food system is at the heart of biodiversity degradation and climate change MORE), who were caught taking expensive private planes for government business on the public's dime.

EPA's Inspector General Arthur Elkins, Jr. is now investigating Pruitt's travel through Sept. 30, 2017, considering the "frequency, cost, and extent" and whether travel policies were followed to prevent waste, fraud and abuse. Pruitt used private and military jet travel instead of commercial airlines for EPA work on four occasions at a cost of nearly $60,000. He traveled 48 of his first 92 days as administrator — 43 of those days included stops in his home state of Oklahoma.

The second investigation questions Pruitt advocating lobbying. At a meeting with the National Mining Association in April, he exhorted mining association members to tell Trump to withdraw from the Paris climate deal.

Pruitt's staff also pressed lawmakers and conservative groups to publicly criticize the climate agreement, increasing public pressure on the resident. Afterward, mining association executives voted to support the U.S. withdrawal.

These actions exemplify a potentially larger pattern of illegal activities by Pruitt and EPA staff as these directives from a cabinet member may violate anti-lobbying laws for government officials.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) provides legal opinions on anti-lobbying questions. But first, the EPA's inspector general must "develop a comprehensive factual record" for conducting the analysis. He has not forwarded its investigation's findings to the GAO. Once it does, the GAO will complete its inquiry.

The GAO will also investigate an appearance of impropriety by Pruitt in a video sanctioned by the National Cattlemen's Beef Association to promote weakening EPA's Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule.

In this review to rescind or revise the Clean Water Rule, Pruitt essentially urged the public to comment in favor of repealing the rule. The video advises viewers "tell EPA to kill WOTUS."

The GAO investigation will examine if Pruitt violated laws on the use of appropriated funds for lobbying, publicity and propaganda purposes and for violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act. Obviously, calling on the public to support a rule's withdrawal does not appear fair, impartial or open-minded, and undermines the idea that public participation matters.

Yet another investigation will consider possible ethical violations from Pruitt's insistence that he did not use a personal email address for official EPA business and for speeches he gave to conservative organizations about environmental policy while he was Oklahoma attorney general.

He also ran afoul of professional responsibility in rules for Oklahoma Bar Association lawyers for possibly lying under oath and violation of ethical rules associated with the practice of law. Once the investigation is complete, the bar association's Professional Responsibility Commission may take disciplinary action against him.

The complaint asserts that Pruitt violated Oklahoma's rules of professional conduct for attorneys when he testified during his confirmation hearing for EPA administrator that he did not use a personal "me.com" email address for official state business. Oklahoma public-records revealed that he received at least one email message at his "me.com" email address.

The GAO opened one more inquiry into whether EPA circumvented the Trump administration's own ethics rules when hiring certain agency employees.

To fulfill his promise to "drain the swamp" in Washington, Trump issued an executive order last January prohibiting executive branch employees from participating "in any particular matter" on which they had lobbied in the two years before their appointment.

In August, Tom Carper Thomas (Tom) Richard CarperOvernight Energy: BLM staff face choice of relocation or resignation as agency moves | Trump says he's 'very much into climate' | EPA rule would expand limits on scientific studies Democrats give Warren's 'Medicare for All' plan the cold shoulder Liz Cheney applauds Trump for pulling out of Paris climate agreement MORE (D-Del.) and Sheldon Whitehouse Sheldon WhitehouseDemocratic senators seek documents on Trump's alleged call for Barr press conference Senate committee advances budget reform plan Bipartisan Enzi-Whitehouse budget bill a very bad fix for deficits MORE (D-R.I.), asked GAO to investigate a violation of Trump's lobbying rules. The senators alleged that EPA bypassed that order by hiring certain political appointees under a provision of the Safe Drinking Water Act that authorizes the EPA to hire up to 30 people "without regard to civil service laws."

The senators' joint statement said, "The whole point of ethics laws is to give the American people confidence that the work of their government is being conducted fairly, honestly, and free from special interest sway. But when an agency can just ignore those rules — and congressional oversight — the result often leads to corruption and scandal."

EPA's inspector general has agreed to review whether Pruitt misused appropriated funds when he spent $25,000 installing a secure, soundproof communications booth in his office. According to a government contracting database, Pruitt also paid $7,978 more to remove closed-circuit television equipment to accommodate the booth in an area off his third-floor office. Pruitt has come under fire for building the booth when a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility that guards against electronic surveillance and suppresses data leakage of sensitive information is already available to him at EPA headquarters.

On Dec 18, Sen. Carper sent a letter to EPA's inspector general asking to expand his current audit of Pruitt's travel a third time to include the administrator's recent four-day junket to Morocco to increase exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas. It's suspicious since natural gas exports do not fall within the EPA's mission. Flying first class, the trip cost taxpayers $40,000.

Given the scope and seriousness of the allegations, we think the inspector general will likely grant this request. Carper added, "I presume Mr. Pruitt is aware his agency's inspector general is conducting an investigation into his questionable travel, which makes his decision to take this trip an odd choice at best."

So, inspector general investigations are in, while Pruitt has been at EPA's helm for only 10 months. And, they are expected to provide lots of drama in 2018.

The outdoor company did not exaggerate. Trump's proclamations whacked away at Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments, with no regard given to the careful deliberation in establishing their original boundaries.

He revoked protections for land rich in fossils and archaeological sites. He opened ecologically rich wildlands to extractive industries. And he broke yet another federal commitment to Native America at Bears Ears, the first national monument dedicated to Indian culture.

Utah congressmen introduced two bills the next day to codify the president's executive orders. These bills would install local Utah county commissioners as managers at diminished monuments and at a newly created sham national park. They would transfer ownership of public lands to the state and would escalate Trump's rejection of science-based conservation. Full of poison pills, the bills will never pass.

One aspect of this depressing mess has received little attention. National monuments like Grand Staircase and Bears Ears — managed by the Bureau of Land Management — have a different mission than national monuments or parks managed by the National Park Service.

The Park Service has a challenging dual charge, conserving the land and providing for the enjoyment of the people. BLM land, defined as

"multiple-use" land, gives equal weight to many "judicious" uses of "diverse resources," though this does not mean using every acre for every use. Recreation is dispersed, with little infrastructure. Conservation and science can flourish alongside hunting and livestock grazing.

The full-sized Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears national monuments link national parks and national forests, from Bryce Canyon to Canyonlands. Connecting these preserves allows regional management on a scale first envisioned in the 1930s.

The unbroken expanses of protected areas form a buffer and matrix for wilderness, for ecologically sensitive springs, for Native sacred sites. Chopping them up in difficult-to-manage islands blocks wildlife migration. Transferring jurisdiction from trained scientists and public lands professionals to local politicians runs the risk of parochial and misguided decisions.

These BLM public lands have always been seen as the leftovers, mostly desert, unworthy of becoming a national forest, park or wildlife refuge. When President Clinton created Grand Staircase-Escalante from existing BLM land in 1996, his Interior Department, led by Secretary Bruce Babbitt surprised folks who assumed the new monument would go to the National Park Service. Babbitt and his team wanted to allow these exceptional public lands to remain with the Bureau of Land Management.

Grand Staircase became the seed for a new system of protected lands in America. Each new large national monument proclaimed on BLM land since Grand Staircase stayed with the BLM and remained in multiple-use.

These 27 national monuments have become the core units of what we now call the National Conservation Lands System, acknowledged in a 2009 law as a permanent part of the public trust. Managers long focused on grazing and fossil fuel extraction have been asked to modernize and broaden the agency's culture to include conservation and restoration.

These monuments are not "land grabs." They were BLM public lands before designation and they remain BLM public lands after designation. Grazing, hunting, and valid existing mineral rights continue — unlike national parks. The proclamation for each monument says so, and these proclamations are law.

Cascade-Siskiyou on the Oregon-California border is a hotspot of biodiversity and climate change research. And Gold Butte, with phenomenal rock art and Paiute cultural sites is Nevada's "piece of the Grand Canyon." As in Utah, Zinke disdains the resources highlighted by these monument proclamations.

Let's honor the vision behind these large-scale preserves. Just as Wallace Stegner famously described national parks as "America's best idea," our system of BLM national monuments just might be Bruce Babbitt's best idea.

As national parks grow ever more crowded, we'll need to protect the open spaces of surrounding BLM lands to preserve our opportunities for exploration and self-discovery, for a sense of the frontier, for discoveries by scientists to questions we haven't yet asked.

Few places remain with the wild integrity of southern Utah's redrock canyon country. After the lawsuits play out that surely will find Trump in violation of the law in his heedless downsizing of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase, we'll need to heal the rifts left by the chaos triggered by the president. Let's start thinking now about how we can regain the conservation momentum we've lost.

His most recent book is Red Rock Stories: Three Generations of Writers Speak on Behalf of Utah's Public Lands.While the advantages of extremely strong cybersecurity are much like the benefits of living a healthy life, it is hard to truly appreciate them until they are gone.

Just in the next four years (2017-2021), cyber crime damage costs are expected to hit $6 trillion annually, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. As more and more humans gain internet access and create digital profiles (currently 51 percent of the world's population of 7 billion people), cyber attackers will continue to gain more influence and power.

Luckily, technological advances and accessibility to blockchain engineers have enabled companies like REMME, a startup that enables passwordless authentication across a variety of platforms, to fundamentally disrupt cyber space by building on top of the bitcoin blockchain.

These companies have successfully eradicated the need for storing and collecting fragile passwords by creating a decentralized 'access management system.' In other words, they are building a more transparent and secure way of controlling who has access to what information. In the most practical sense, they have created a foolproof mechanism for user authentication that does not require password input.

The biggest problem in many systems is that human beings are prone to make errors. We forget things. We are careless. We get greedy and do what we should not be doing. While this can be trivial in some cases, in larger scale states, it can be the difference between success and bankruptcy.

This problem of "human error" has been a constant throughout history and is unlikely to change anytime soon. Many of the problems in cybersecurity root themselves in this tendency.

What is promising, and likely to fundamentally disrupt the cyber security space in the near future, is that entrepreneurs are finding ways to leverage frontier technology to enable processes and structures that reduce (or entirely cut out) human error and provide systematic, controlled means of organization.

Here are 3 ways passwordless authentication will change the web (for the better)

Distributed authentication for web site owners and web service providers

Right now, web site owners and web service providers store almost all of their user information, like usernames, passwords, emails, credit cards, etc., in one centralized location. For obvious reasons, if someone gets access to this database, there is huge liability and risk, often times costing firms billions and billions of dollars of damaging costs.

Centralized systems are incredibly vulnerable to lone wolf attacks. Instead, it is possible to create a decentralized system that distributes verification across many nodes, which mitigates risk and further secures the data.

Internal enterprise systems

One of the biggest challenges that large enterprises have to deal with is managing the risk that comes with employing thousands of people. The challenge becomes 10x as complex when, to do their jobs effectively, employees need to get access to sensitive and confidential information. These employees, high ranking or not, generally need some sort of user, password, and login to get this information, and do their work.

The problem is that freely distributing access to information for hundreds, or even thousands of employees, is a huge security risk. Most security breaches happen because of a careless human error, such as employees leaving their browsers open in public or leaving a trailing sticky note behind. On top of that, there is a slew of spammy cyber attacks that come through in the form of phishing emails, that try to bait a company's employees into giving up their login data.

The costs of maintaining access points to all of this sensitive data only increase as companies scale and add new employees. On the other hand, off-boarding employees, and removing proper access points, is a whole separate issue that is extremely costly as well.

All companies would be much better off if the "human element" of accessing information was completely removed. And luckily, that is the future we are marching towards.

IoT: device-to-device communication

Internet connected devices are the future. We are all so excited about the enormous potential that intelligent, "smart things" can do for our homes, cities, and workplaces, that we often forget the enormous vulnerability that accompanies them.

Imagine the worst case scenario: "terrorist-like" hackers have seized control of your car, wreaking havoc on the streets, all from the comfort (and safety) of their home. While this future is not pretty, it is not all that unlikely unless we continue to invest in building more secure authentication systems.

By solving this problem with today's tech, we can create a more secure onboard system that still works with internet connection. Imagine a car-to-car mesh network that enables the exchange of traffic data, avoids accidents, and minimizes traffic. That future is coming, quicker than we all may think.

On Thursday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that the bill amounted to "pillaging" from blue states in order to provide tax cuts for more conservative states.

"This tax provision hits the blue states by eliminating the state and local tax deductibility and uses that money to finance the tax cut in the red states," Cuomo said.

The Republican tax plan eliminates deductions for state and local income and property taxes at $10,000, hitting areas with high property values and high income rates the hardest. Many of these places are located in states like California and New York, which have a history of resisting the Trump administration's agenda. Of the 12 Republican lawmakers who voted against the tax bill, seven are from California or New York.

This partisan tax bill pillages blue states to finance cuts for red states. This is partisan politics over any semblance of good government. https://t.co/MJ5GFTQUCV — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) December 28, 2017

"You want to hurt New York? You want to hurt California?" Cuomo said on CNN. "They're the economic engines."

Earlier in December, Cuomo — along with California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) and New Jersey Gov.-elect Phil Murphy — suggested that progressive states could seek legal recourse against the tax bill, but did not say exactly what that action might look like. In his interview with CNN, Cuomo suggested that the bill might be unconstitutional.

Norm Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former White House ethics czar, said on Twitter that the "disparate treatment of pro GOP and anti-GOP States" in the tax plan "is so grotesque that there may well be a due process claim."

Other legal experts have argued that the challenges would likely depend on state's being able to show that the tax bill violates the protection of states' rights under the U.S. Constitution.

States like California and New York have already been active in challenging the Trump administration's agenda through the courts, from filing lawsuits over the administration's attempts to undermine the Affordable Care Act to challenging rollbacks on environmental regulations.Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard Corps vowed to crush one of the biggest shows of dissent against the government in years, as days of confrontations between demonstrators and security forces turned deadly in a western province. Stocks fell.

The guard — whose mandate is to safeguard the Islamic Revolution — warned late Saturday that it would respond with "a hard punch" if demonstrations didn't stop. Two protesters were killed in Dorud in the province of Lorestan late Saturday during clashes with security forces, Habibollah Khojastehpour, deputy for political affairs for the province of Lorestan, said in an interview posted on the website of Iran's state broadcaster.

The protests, which began in the northeastern city of Mashhad on Thursday, present a serious challenge to President Hassan Rouhani and the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Protesters first took aim at rising food prices and corruption, driven partly by a sense that the July 2015 nuclear deal hasn't delivered the broad economic recovery many were expecting. By Friday, the dissent spread to other areas, and evolved into a wider condemnation of the clerical establishment and security forces.

Government officials have said the protests are part of a wider attempt by Rouhani's opponents to discredit his leadership. Iran's hardline media have said justified criticism of the government has been hijacked by a wider foreign plot to sow sedition in the country.

'Improper Behavior'

Protesters "must certainly know that improper behavior will be to their detriment, and the nation will come out and stand against these actions and throw a hard punch in their faces," the Revolutionary Guard's commander for security in Tehran, Brigadier General Esmail Kowsari, said according to a statement carried by the semi-official Iranian Students' News Agency late Saturday.

The Iranian parliament's national security and foreign policy committee called an extraordinary meeting for this week to assess the events, lawmaker Hossein Naghavi Hosseini told the Iranian Students' News Agency in an interview. Rouhani's office denied a report in the semi-official Iran Newspaper that he planned to give a televised speech on Sunday.

Iran's TEDPIX Index fell 1.7 percent to 95,561.58 in Tehran on Sunday, down to the lowest level since Dec. 20, according to data on the bourse's website.

Overnight unrest in the capital Tehran was concentrated in a few major intersections, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency. The report said bus stops had been vandalized and garbage dumpsters set on fire. There has been heavy police and security presence in restive areas, including scores of anti-riot police clad in black uniforms and helmets. The capital was quiet on Sunday.

The protests have erupted at a time of deepening strains between Iran and the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has imposed additional sanctions on Tehran and has threatened to scuttle the nuclear accord. Trump said on Twitter that the "world is watching" events in Iran, and that the government "should respect their people's rights, including right to express themselves."

The Foreign Ministry in Tehran dismissed Trump's comments, saying "the Iranian people place no value or credibility in the opportunistic claims of U.S. officials or of Mr. Trump himself."

GUWAHATI: At the stroke of midnight Sunday, the Assam government will release the first draft of the much-awaited National Register of Citizens (NRC) with names of 2.24 crore bona fide Indian citizens.Of the 3.28 crore people who had applied for inclusion in the registry, 2.24 crore have found a place in the first draft following verification of their documents. The rest will be considered in the next two drafts, Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal told mediapersons on Saturday."As per hon'ble Supreme Court 's order, there will be two more drafts of the NRC and the names of all genuine citizen claimants whose names do not feature in the first publication will be included in it after verification of the pending documents," Sonowal said.Dispelling apprehensions over security, Sonowal said no untoward situation is expected to arise as the district administrations have been conducting public meetings and campaigns to explain to the people the updation procedures.The chief minister also said the media have an important role to play in disseminating correct information to the public."Social media will be monitored closely for misinformation on the NRC draft and strict action will be taken against those attempting to create trouble," he said.Asked about a tentative date for release of the final draft, Sonowal said, "The Assam government is conducting the NRC updation process with the state government machinery, the district deputy commissioners' offices mobilised for it on the orders of the Supreme Court ... The complete draft will be published after verification of all documents of those who had applied for inclusion."The state coordinator for NRC, Prateek Hajela, asserted that "genuine" Indian citizens need not panic if their names have not appeared in the first draft as verification process is yet to be completed."If the name of any genuine Indian citizen does not appear in the first draft, it means the verification process of that person is yet to be completed," Hajela said, adding there will be scope for making claims after the final draft is published.Union home secretary Rajiv Gauba, during his visit to the state, had also said there will be an opportunity for claims and objections after the release of the third draft."Those who do not find their names in the first draft need not worry as there will be opportunities for subsequent investigation and document verification," Gauba had said after reviewing the NRC updation process in Assam.The office of the state coordinator for NRC has made elaborate arrangements for people to check their names in the first draft at NRC sewa kendras across the state from 8am on January 1. They can also check for information online and through SMS services.Assam, which faced influx from Bangladesh since the early 20th century, is the only state having an NRC, first prepared in 1951.According to the Assam government's official website, "The NRC is a register containing names of Indian citizens. The only time that a National Register of Citizens (NRC) was prepared was in 1951 when after conduct of the Census of 1951."It was prepared by recording particulars of all the persons enumerated during that Census, the website said.The issue of updating the NRC of 1951 was first raised by the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) more than three decades ago. The students' body had submitted a memorandum to the Centre on January 18, 1980, two months after launching the anti-illegal foreigners Assam Movement.On November 17, 1999, at an official-level tripartite meeting to review the implementation of the Assam Accord, a decision was taken that the NRC would be updated and the Centre sanctioned Rs 20 lakh for the purpose and released Rs 5 lakh of it to start the exercise.The final decision to update the NRC was taken on May 5, 2005 when the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh chaired a meeting to review the implementation of the accord.Thereafter, the government created a directorate for updating the NRC and the process of computerisation of the voters' list up to 1971 and the NRC of 1951 began.A pilot project that was launched in two revenue circles of Barpeta and Chaygaon was suspended after a violent protest by a few organisations. The state government then formed a group of ministers (GoM) to hold talks with different organisations to draft modalities for updating the NRC.The updation process finally gained momentum after the Supreme Court started monitoring its progress and set December 31 midnight as the date for publication of the first draft of the NRC.The sight of five young men, all government-sponsored Syrian refugees, protesting outside the YMCA in Saint John, New Brunswick illustrated everything that is wrong about our policy of multiculturalism.

Despite being in Canada for two years, the protesting refugees claimed they still could not express themselves in English.

However, one look at their protest signs — unless they were written for them, which raises other issues — indicated they knew sufficient English to write that "refugees need help they don't need to be put down."

Another protester held a sign playing the victim card: "(Stop) Making fun of our religious beliefs."

Responding to the protest, the YMCA's Angelique Simpson told CBC that finding Arabic speakers for interpreting services continues to be a challenge. But that didn't satisfy the Syrian protesters.

One of them, speaking through an interpreter, shared a story about a Syrian woman who was upset that a male interpreter was made to sit with her. What happened next should infuriate every Canadian.

According to the CBC report, the woman insisted that without her hijab, she couldn't be alone with the male interpreter. And yet such attitudes have official sanction across the country.

A story in the Toronto Star reported on a government-funded kitchen for Syrian refugee women that, in the words of one of them, "brings me back to Syria."

Instead of helping these women find work among the thousands of Canadian restaurants and fast-food outlets where they would mesh with Canadians and understand the culture, we are making investments so Syrian refugees can mentally remain in Syria.

Contrast those examples with the experiences of two refugees from Balochistan, who have embraced Canada and assimilated into the fabric of the True North.

Just about the time in 2014-2015 when the Syrian refugees arrived in Canada, I was involved in arranging refuge in Canada for a young man and woman fleeing for their lives to escape the Pakistan army in Balochistan.

Both Baloch refugees spoke no English when they arrived at Pearson Airport. When I asked Lateef Johar whether he wanted to make a phone call home to his mom to let her know about his safe escape, he burst into laughter.

In broken Urdu (Balochi is the only language he spoke fluently at the time) he said: "Phone? My village does not even have electricity, not even a road."

He had escaped hidden in a truckload of onions for 16 hours before he was finally able to outwit his pursuers.

The other Baloch was a young woman, Karima Baloch, who also spoke no English. I was her interpreter when she met MP Bill Blair as one of his constituents. At that time, she did not speak a single word of English.

Fast forward to 2017. Lateef Johar now speaks fluent English, has completed Grade 12 at night school and will soon be a student at York University. He tweets in English and has also tried his hand at poetry.

Karima Baloch recently spoke at a community event in flawless English, leaving her audience and myself pleasantly shocked.

Why could Baloch refugees assimilate on their own while the Syrians couldn't?

As the "uncle" of these two Baloch refugees, I had set three rules for them.

1. No ethnic radio or TV in your home.

2. Listen to Metro Morning on CBC and light rock on 97.3FM and 98.1FM.

3. Read a daily newspaper.

Thank you!Bhí bunscoil Ghaeltachta dhá oide i gConamara ina ábhar mór aighnis i 1986 agus tuismitheoirí na scoile ag diúltú a gcuid páistí a chur chuici.

Tá sé tagtha chun solais anois i gcomhaid an stáit atá eisithe faoin 'Riail 30 Bliain' gur tugadh comhairle dlí don Roinn Oideachais gur ghníomh mídhleathach a bhí ann múinteoir neamhcháilithe a fhágáil ag teagasc sa bhunscoil ar an Sraith Salach in áit an Phríomhoide, Bríd Ní Dhomhnaill.

Cé gur tugadh é seo le fios do Bhord Bainistíochta na scoile tuigeadh don Roinn nach raibh an sagart paróiste, a bhí ina Chathaoirleach ar an Bhord, sásta aon ghníomh a dhéanamh leis an fhadhb a réiteach.

Cause célèbre a bhí sa chás d'eagraíochtaí Gaeilge ag an am de thairbhe go raibh an teanga sáite i gcroílár na conspóide.

Thosaigh na fadhbanna ar an chéad lá de Mheán Fómhair 1986, tráth a d'oscail an scoil arís tar éis laethanta saoire an tsamhraidh. Scríobh Cathaoirleach bhord na scoile, an tAthair Gabriel Charles, chuig an Roinn Oideachais ag lorg cead príomhoide na scoile, Bríd Ní Dhomhnaill, a bhriseadh óna post.

Mhaígh sé go raibh fíordhroch-chaidreamh aici le tuismitheoirí na scoile agus nach raibh sí in ann dá post a thuilleadh. I measc na líomhaintí eile a rinne an sagart dúradh nach raibh na tuismitheoirí ró-shásta lena stíl mhúinteoireachta agus mhaígh sé go raibh an smacht caillte go hiomlán aici.

Ach ba léir go raibh nithe eile ag dó na geirbe dó. Ba bheag Gaeilge a bhí ag sagart cúnta an cheantair, an tAthair John O'Gorman, a bhí i mbun cúrsaí eaglasta i nGaeltacht Bhun na gCnoc agus rinne Bríd Ní Dhomhnaill gearán faoi seo:

"Recently she has interfered in the liturgical affairs of the Recess area of the parish, insisting that mass in the Derryvoreeda mass centre should be said entirely in Irish. This has lead to a lot of media attention especially from Radio na Gaeltachta with which Miss Ní Domnaill is constantly in contact," a scríobh an tAthair Gabriel Charles.

Dúirt sé nach raibh na tuismitheoirí sásta ligean dá gcuid páistí freastal ar an scoil go dtí go mbrisfí Bríd Ní Dhomhnaill óna post. Mhaígh sé ina litir chuig an Roinn Oideachais go raibh cur chuige Bhríd Ní Dhomhnaill i leith na Gaeilge místuama:

"now borders on the irrational and will lead to the gradual disappearance of the Irish language from the district."

Ní bheadh na tuismitheoirí sásta comhoibriú arís go dtí go mbrisfí an Príomhoide as a post, dar leis.

Thug an Roinn Oideachais freagra ar iarratas an tsagairt ar an 12 Meán Fómhair. Dúradh nach raibh aon chumhacht ag an Aire Oideachais i leith múinteoirí a bhriseadh, gur faoin Bhord Bainistíochta a bheadh sé a leithéid a dhéanamh ach gur orthusan fosta a thitfeadh aon dliteanas ó thaobh cúiteamh as duine a bhriseadh as post go héagórach. Dúradh fosta nárbh eol don Aire oideachais gur sháraigh Bríd Ní Dhomhnaill rialacha na mBunscoileanna. Dá mbrisfí óna post í ní fhéadfaí í a chur ar an phainéal do phost múinteoireachta eile a dúradh.

D'fhill na páistí ar an scoil ar an 20 Deireadh Fómhair, 1986. Chuaigh na páistí ab óige chuig an múinteoir eile a bhí fostaithe sa scoil ach chuaigh na páistí ní ba shine go seomra breise áit a raibh siad á dteagasc ag bean nach raibh cáilithe mar bhunmhúinteoir.

Bhí na tuismitheoirí ag íoc thuarastal na mná seo fad is a bhí Bríd Ní Dhomhnaill ina suí i seomra folamh. Mhaígh an tAthair Gabriel Charles go raibh ceart de réir an Bhunreachta ag na tuismitheoirí go gcuirfí oideachas ar a gcuid leanaí.

Scríobh an Roinn Oideachais chuige ar an 29 Deireadh Fómhair agus cuireadh in iúl dó go raibh an tAire Oideachais, Paddy Cooney, buartha go raibh páistí faoi chúram múinteora nach raibh ceadaithe ag an Roinn, agus go raibh sí ag teagasc sa scoil rud a bhí ag sárú Rialacha na mBunscoileanna:

"It follows, therefore, that Recess school is not being conducted at present as a national school in accordance with the terms of the Rules and the school lease and that the principal teacher is not in a position to carry out her post," a thug an Roinn le fios i litir chuig Bord Bainistíochta na scoile ar an 14 Eanáir.

Tugadh le fios don Roinn i gcomhrá gutháin leis an Athair Gabriel Charles nach mbeadh sé ag tabhairt freagra ar an litir sin.

Rinne an INTO, a bhí ag déanamh ionadaíochta ar Bhríd Ní Dhomhnaill, iarratas go dtabharfaí cóip den litir sin daofa. Mhaígh siad nach bhféadfaidís a ndualgas ó thaobh cosaint a thabhairt don phríomhoide a chomhlíonadh gan na fíricí uilig a bheith ar fáil dóibh.

Dúirt Oifig an Phríomh-Aturnae Stáit go mbeadh láncheart ag an Aire aitheantas a bhaint don scoil cionn is go raibh siad ag sárú na rialacha. Thiocfadh leis fosta an dlí a chur ar iontaobhaithe na scoile chun suim de £16,500 a fháil ar ais uathu mar go raibh 'sárú iontaoibhe' i gceist.

The Republic of Korea's President Moon Jae-in was simply telling the truth when he said on Thursday that the 2015 agreement between his country and Japan intended to settle once and for all the decades-long row over Korean women forced into wartime sexual slavery was seriously flawed, "both in process and content".



His remarks came after a state-appointed panel concluded the ROK's former government failed to properly communicate with the victims to get their consent on the deal and covered up the Japanese demands that Seoul avoid using the term "sexual slavery" — with Seoul agreeing to formally refer to the victims as "victims of Japanese military comfort stations" — and provide a specific plan to remove a bronze statue representing sex slaves in front of its embassy in Seoul.



That is why the deal, though called "final and irreversible", has never really resolved the highly emotional issue, which remains a thorn in bilateral relations, as proved by the continuation of weekly demonstrations in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul.



It was always an agreement struck on shaky ground, and Japan has been angry that Seoul hasn't taken steps to remove the statue and similar memorials in the country, while it has fostered anger in the ROK as it failed to seek an explicit apology from the Japanese government for wartime abuses.



It is not a question of money.



The fund established under the 2015 deal provides 1 billion yen ($8.8 million) to the surviving victims in the name of recovering their "honor and dignity" and healing their "psychological wounds". It is about Japan shirking its responsibilities, as Tokyo stopped short of calling the money official government compensation, thereby refusing to acknowledge the Japanese government at the time systematically organized military sex enslavement.



Historical records and memories of the victims themselves suggest that Japan forced tens of thousands of women from Korea and other Asian countries that it invaded during World War II to be sex slaves for its imperial army.



Yet the current Japanese administration has been reluctant to acknowledge this, insisting that "comfort women" were recruited by civilians and that the army brothels were commercially operated.



Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe once even said the women were not forced to be sex slaves as "there was no evidence to prove there was coercion as initially suggested".



Because of all this, the victims and their sympathizers have never accepted the deal, seeing it as political expediency.



As Moon said, the agreement cannot resolve the comfort women issue.

That can only happen when those in Japan who continue to insist on whitewashing the country's wartime history face it squarely so that the past can be laid to rest.SPOILER ALERT: Do not read if you have not yet watched the "USS Callister" episode of "Black Mirror's" fourth season.

When Cristin Milioti first received materials for "Black Mirror's" "USS Callister" episode, she had no idea just how timely the story would become — that of a young woman, harassed at work by male bosses but who topples the patriarchy in a virtual reality world to become the captain of a the spaceship. In fact, she didn't even know that was the character journey for Nanette, the woman she would be playing in the fourth season of Netflix's futuristic anthology drama.

"I was only given a couple of pages of the script," Milioti admits, explaining that the two scenes she was given initially were when Nanette meets Robert Daley (Jesse Plemons) on her first day in the gaming company's office and the scene on the ship where she rallies the crew by telling them she'll blackmail herself in order to get to Daley's refrigerator full of his co-workers' DNA.

"I was not able to piece things together from those two scenes, but I knew I loved how it was written and I loved her, in particular," Milioti says.

Noting that it is very important to her to play "fully realized women who are very strong," Milioti points out the unpacking of its characters' layers is what made "USS Callister" stand out to her.

"She's so tough, but one can write her off at first as being this very sweet, meek women in the office who just has her head down and is trying to focus on her work and isn't taken as seriously as she would like to be taken. But when push comes to shove, she can captain a ship. She has a strength in her that no one saw coming. She's a spitfire," Milioti says of Nanette.

The episode starts by following Plemons' Daley, a beaten-down tech genius by day who enters a virtual reality world of his own creation by night to lead a space crew of his real world co-workers on missions modeled after a beloved show from his childhood (the fictional "Space Fleet," which looks a lot like "Star Trek").

"It's supposed to be heightened. It's supposed to be sort of phony in some way. And that's when I realized we should really go all-out. We couldn't hold back on this. We had to go fully 'Star Trek' on the way that it was shot, the way that we held the camera," director Toby Haynes says. "We literally built a spaceship that had a ceiling in the studio, and when we put a ceiling in, we had to light it like the original 'Star Trek.' When we come in close we needed to get the full molding lights and the back lights and the key lights, especially for those Kirk-like close-ups [on Daley]. It was a language."

While that virtual world first just feels like a way for the man to escape Daley's lackluster reality, he begins to show abuses of power within that world — first with the way he treats his crew there and then through the reveal of how he got that crew in the first place. In the "real" world, Daley collected and copied his co-workers' DNA, effectively creating digital clones of them that he trapped inside the confines of the virtual world. They have the consciousnesses and the memories of his still very much alive co-workers, but they are doomed to bide their time on the spaceship, awaiting Daley's visits to go on missions and fearing his wrath when he arrives.

"We think he's the protagonist at first — he's the hero — but slowly we realize he's the villain, and I thought that was so well done," Milioti says. "He's a bully. He's bullied into being a bully, and it's beautiful that they did that so you understand why he is the way he is, but it doesn't make it right."

Nanette is introduced a few scenes into the episode, as a new employee at Daley's company who has to deal with two kinds of harassment not only from Daley but from another executive at his company (played by Jimmi Simpson).

"This is a woman, who has Jimmi Simpson's character putting his hand on her lower back and even Jesse Plemons' character wants to make it something sexual, but she just wants to work," Milioti explains, adding that she "just wants to be taken seriously as a coder" but like so many who enter a hostile workplace faces micro-aggressive harassment and chooses to deal with it in a way that has her "keeping her distance but with a smile" so as to not cause more problems or to lose the job she loves.

"What started out as 'I want to work with the man who inspired me' becomes shut down because it's inappropriate almost immediately," MIlioti says. "So the way I tried to portray her in the office is as someone who is overwhelmed by the niceties that she has to insist upon herself in the business world. If she wants to get ahead, she has to just smile, and as opposed to just ripping the hand off of her back, she shrugs her shoulders. I tried to make her voice a little higher, too, because it's that thing where you're just like, 'Oh gosh, sorry!' when you really want to be like, 'Don't kiss me on both cheeks, we're not in Europe!'".

But after Daley overhears Nanette saying she doesn't want to pursue anything romantically, he feels slighted and uploads a copy of her DNA to his custom program as well. A new version of Nanette awakens on the ship and struggles to adjust to the reality that she is stuck there while another version of herself lives out in the "real world."

"When she's on the ship, the stakes are so incredibly high for her, and she's fighting for her life, so all of those niceties just go out the window, and she lets go of the bulls— and the need to be polite and smile, all of that," Milioti says. "She actually realizes her greatest potential. It's why she fights him, it's why she makes fun of him. As much as she's a prisoner in that world, she takes the filter off for the first time and says, 'F— you.' I think she's the truest version of herself on that ship."

Nanette leads a revolution of the others on the ship to wipe his custom program. It is a plan that requires them to reach out to the real world version of herself in order to break into Daley's home and steal their DNA so that he cannot just upload new copies of them and start the process over. Haynes admits he was nervous about the end and at one point questioned if it wouldn't be a more fitting, typical "Black Mirror" end if the final shot was on Daley, stuck in his chair in his apartment in the quote-unquote real world.

"Charlie said not every 'Black Mirror' has to end in such a dark place," Haynes says. "He knows that he has this in his back pocket — an episode that will end in a more positive place. I think it will really surprise people to have something that has such a dramatic draw but ends so positively as 'USS Callister.' It really throws you around tonally and emotionally. At least, that's what I tried to do, to take these characters — these avatars — in a virtual environment and make you feel for them, make you care about them, and come away with a kind of empathy."

Nanette's plan is also one Milioti feels reflects the reality she wants to see more of in the actual real world: "a woman in charge [fighting] against a small-minded, misogynist bully."

"In the quote-unquote real world, she probably continues to be a team player and very sweet and keeps her nose to the grindstone, but in the fake world she becomes a captain and beats the super villain," Milioti says. "It's amazing. Something that starts out so bleak is able to turn into her own hero's story, and I love that."

"Black Mirror" is streaming now on Netflix.The blockchain space has been innovating at an incredible pace over the past year. The total number of initial coin offerings (ICOs) was probably less than 10. If someone had told you that insurance company AIG was conducting a multi-country smart contract test, you'd have thought they were crazy. Certainly, the idea of putting an Arkansas chicken farm on a blockchain would have seemed ludicrous. The question of when blockchains would hit the mainstream was a legitimate one.

Ethereum was under $10 and Bitcoin was under $650 a year ago. You know what has happened since then. Bitcoin is above $4,500, Ethereum is above $300, and ICOs have surpassed early stage VC funding.

So what accounts for the intensity? While there are elements of frenzy/bubble, I think the story is much bigger than that. Legendary venture capitalist Fred Wilson wrote of the emerging blockchain space last year:

I believe that business model innovation is more disruptive that technological innovation. Incumbents can adapt to and adopt new technological changes (web to mobile) way easier than they can adapt to and adopt new business models (selling software to free ad-supported software). So this new protocol-based business model feels like one of these "changes of venue" as my partner Brad likes to call them. And that smells like a big investable macro trend to me.

Over the past year, the earliest students and practitioners of blockchains and decentralized systems recognized the real innovation, the so-called "killer app" of the blockchain era: the ICO (or the more SEC-friendly version, known as a "Token Generation Event"), but not because it's a way to raise money for an entity. This isn't about creating a crypto-Kickstarter.

Instead, the ICO (er, TGE) represents an entirely new paradigm for the funding and promotion of sustainable innovation with ever faster feedback loops, which leads to even more innovation that, in the long term, handsomely rewards the entrepreneur risk-takers as well as the earliest adopters who believe in the long-term potential of the idea.

That's a lot, so let's think about it another way.

Consider the evolutionary tree. In the beginning, there is one simple organism. Over time, as its external environment changes, it needs to adapt and mutate. Some mutations die. Some barely make it. Some thrive beyond imagination.

What is true about every adaptation and mutation, however, is that the "source code" of each organism is not lost. It is leveraged by the next evolutionary step, not thrown away. Some parts may or may not be useful as the organism evolves, but it's all still there.

Each new organism has the built-in option to freely build upon everything that came before it without permission. In nature, a "fork" of the source code is a feature, not a bug.

The evolution of innovation

Getting back to tech: Until very recently, if you had a new business idea, you worked in a closed environment, protecting your ideas from the world and, if you needed external funding, there was a high friction (cost+time) process to go out and get it.

Sharing your ideas meant putting your own survival in jeopardy. Patent offices became necessary because of the need to protect people's innovations in this closed environment.

While the pace of innovation is improved in a patent-centric system, it's not as fast as it could be, for a few reasons.

Consider what happens when a patented innovation fails in the marketplace. First, the human knowledge that was generated in the process of creating the innovation is often locked away in files (paper or digital), not readily accessible to others.

Second, future innovation is thwarted by the very same patent that was intended to protect the original creator.

The second-generation innovator who thinks she can do it better faces a number of barriers to innovation.

What is so powerful about blockchain/decentralized/protocol-based business models with tokens is that they fix these problems.

By issuing a cryptographically secure token for a given innovation, the entrepreneur simultaneously protects her own interest in the future evolution of the project and incentivizes the earliest users to go out and use or evangelize the innovation to others. As we learn in a study of protocol economics, token value appreciation is the key to driving long-term profitability. As long as people use or find value in the token, the entrepreneur is getting rewarded in a way that reflects overall market demand. This is already a big step forward since previous open source projects like Linux had to be funded via foundations and donations.

Now compare the time and cost of setting up an ICO/TGE with the process of creating a patent. It is probably orders of magnitude more efficient and less expensive. (I'm going to leave aside the issue of regulation/scams, etc. although that is an important consideration as we head into this next era).

Finally, blockchain-based tech enables that same kind of evolutionary forking we saw in our mutating organisms. Because the creator's rights and value are protected cryptographically by the blockchain, she can now open source her IP on a repository like GitHub. Anyone can inspect it, use it, modify it, or clone it.

You might ask, "If someone can clone it, won't they just copy and steal it?"

Yes, this is possible, but there's actually a disincentive to do this because of network effects. If someone launches a protocol token you think has tremendous potential, you have two choices: You can buy in early and very cheap (just ask the people who obtained Bitcoin in 2009 or 2010 or those who bought Ethereum at the crowdsale.) Or you can copy it and launch your own competing network that does the exact same thing. In the second scenario, you have the burden of managing the code yourself and marketing the protocol — work that has already been done. You're much better off just buying it and submitting pull requests to GitHub to improve the value of the protocol significantly for you, the entrepreneur, and the other early adopters.

Of course, if the inital project fails and you want to start over completely, you have the option of cloning the original. This might be the case, for example, if the project has been abandoned by its creators, an internal community civil war has caused the value of the protocol token to plummet to basically zero, or the founders are total morons and are bungling the project. While the failed project may disappoint those who believed in it, at least society won't lose the whatever good genetics it had to offer. The source code is not locked away or difficult to use. Anyone can go in and start again without permission (that's why public blockchain people love to talk about "permissionless innovation.")

This is where we come back to the evolutionary process and how a "fork" is a feature, not bug.

Imagine you are Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. You invent something really cool and everybody is excited about it. Then, in what is probably the first-ever global demonstration of how awesome your idea is, something goes horribly wrong and your protocol is shown to have a huge security flaw in that allows one person to steal a huge amount of money from everyone else.

You say, "Well, we can't just let that happen when the technology has so much potential, so I am going to rally the community to force the evolution of this protocol in a direction that punishes the guy who stole everyone's money." You do exactly this.

However, there are a bunch of people who don't agree with your decision. They believe that one of the core elements of your awesome protocol is that "you can never rewrite history." So, they say, "Sorry, Vitalik, your idea for protocol evolution does not work for us. We are not willing to rewrite history, so we are going to keep chugging along the path as originally intended."

This is exactly what happened in July of last year when Ethereum did a hard fork that split it from the original chain, now known as Ethereum Classic.

But here's the magnificent part.

Vitalik's contribution is still recognized and rewarded, even by the very same people who disagree with him. Why? Because all of the tokens he had before the fork on Ethereum, he now has in the form of Ether AND Ether Classic. More recently, everyone who had Bitcoin prior to its August 1 fork now has the same amount of Bitcoin Cash (though there are plenty of people who either have not claimed it or have not been able to get it, but that's another story.)

We're all better off with protocol-based token innovation

The Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash communities both believed that the future adaptation of the protocols required a different direction in order to thrive and survive. They may both be right. Like evolution, each stage is an experiment in survival and innovation.

What's exciting is that they could launch those experiments without asking anyone for permission, at relatively low cost in terms of money and time, and the original project's innovators and early adopters automatically get a fair share of the value.

This is a good thing for all of us.

He currently works with startups in the blockchain and decentralization space, including OpenBazaar, IOTA, and Zcash.If there is a "sweet spot" for blockchain, it will likely be the ability to turn insights and questions into assets. Blockchains will give you greater confidence in the integrity of the data you see. Immutable entries, consensus-driven timestamping, audit trails, and certainty about the origin of data (e.g. a sensor or a kiosk) are all areas where you will see improvement as blockchain technology becomes more mainstream.

Beyond data integrity (which is a huge component), the shared data layer that blockchains will introduce creates an entirely new set of possibilities for AI capabilities and insights. Trent McConaghy, CTO of BigChainDB does a great job in explaining the benefits of decentralized/

shared control, particularly as a foundation for AI. In this world, he says, you get:

• More data, thus improved modelling capabilities

• Qualitatively new data leading to entirely new models.

The inherent immutability leads to more confidence in training and testing data and the models they produce.

We are also likely to see blockchain-based technology make an impact in the cost of storing data and in the amount (and quality) of data available. Cost savings in data storage will come from the disintermediation of centralized storage providers, thus reducing the "trust tax" you pay them currently. This should also create downward pricing pressure on SaaS suppliers as they move to decentralized storage providers.

You can expect to see decentralized solutions like Storj, Sia, MaidSafe, and FileCoin start to gain some initial traction in the enterprise storage space. [Disclosure: Storj was previously a client of mine.] One enterprise pilot phase rollout indicates this decentralized approach could reduce the costs of storing data by 90 percent compared to AWS.

As for blockchain-driven AI, you can expect to see a three phase roll-out. First, within the existing enterprise. Then, within the ecosystem. Finally, totally open systems. The entire industry might be termed blockchains for big data (McConaghy's words).

Longer term, we will see an expansion of the concept of big data, as we move from proprietary data silos to blockchain-enabled shared data layers. In the first epoch of big data, power resided with those who owned the data. In the blockchain epoch of big data, power will reside with those who can access the most data (where public blockchains will ultimately defeat private blockchains) and who can gain the most insights most rapidly.

There are two significant implications here:

• Customer data will not belong to organizations, locked away in corporate databases. It will belong to each individual, represented as tokens or coins on an identity blockchain. The customer of the future will grant access to others as necessary.

• Transaction data will be viewable by anyone. Anyone can access the data about the transactions that occur on a given blockchain. (For example, here are the latest Bitcoin transactions.)

When data moves out of proprietary systems onto open blockchains, having the data itself is no longer a competitive advantage. Interpreting the data becomes the advantage. In a blockchain world, all competitors are looking at the same ledger (imagine you and your competitors all have the Google Sheet or Excel file).

Anyone can provide an interface to that ledger. That's relatively easy. That's what you see here for Ethereum or zCash.

And many companies will provide applications that enable a customer to interact with a protocol. This is what Jaxx or BitPay do, for Bitcoin.

Yet, there are very few companies that provide a set of analytic capabilities that suck up all of this data and explain what it all means or what should be done about it. Fewer still have figured out the scalable process for doing this. This is the opportunity. Some have called it the "Data Industrialization Opportunity."

Simply put, it is the question of who can put the best AI/machine learning solution on top of open, shared, blockchain-based data layers. Whoever does that gains some degree of competitive advantage. If a Bitcoin wallet, for example, instead of being "dumb" (as it is now) is actually "smart" — in the sense that it can advise or help customers make sense of the world (based on all the data available on the blockchain) — that one will be market leader.

The world's top 50 physical mining companies are worth about $700 billion. You can expect to see blockchain-based data mining companies that will easily take us into trillions of dollars of market capitalization, although, granted, this may be many years off.

He advises F2000 organizations on the implications of blockchain technology. Previously, he was VP of marketing at Sprinklr from Series A to "unicorn" status.The news made the rounds in early April. "America's Retailers Are Closing Stores Faster Than Ever" read a Bloomberg headline. "These 21 Retailers Are Closing 3,591 Stores — Who Is Next?" wrote Forbes.

It felt like the end of an era for many.

Back in 1998, I worked at a company called Snickelways (alas, it didn't make it), but the focus was on e-commerce. Anyone working in the industry then (and there were a lot of us) saw the writing on the wall. We knew that traditional retailing would die. The only thing we didn't know was when.

This past Sunday, I was in a local Best Buy. The only reason I was there was because it is the closest place to my house where I can recycle electronics. So, once a quarter or so, I drop old items off.

As I headed out of the store, I paused and looked around. It was 5:15 pm on a Sunday and the store was basically empty. There were maybe five customers that I could see.

And 10-15 employees.

No one was in line at the cash register. No one was in line at customer service. I've been to a morgue, so I won't say, "it was like a morgue," but wow ... was it quiet.

I asked the two guys working at the door (ostensibly to prevent shoplifters) if this was average.

"Pretty much," one said. "And weekdays are even less."

I'm not a genius at investing, but my first thought was, "I should short this stock." (They seem to be doing ok as of late, though and this guy is bullish, so what do I know?).

Having foresight and dealing with change

And that brings me to one of my favorite topics: decentralized blockchain-based apps.

I'm a blockchain and cryptocurrency enthusiast, so I tend to talk to my friends a lot about the spectacular rise in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

When the topic came up last weekend, one of my friends said, "I'll probably never buy it, even though I get it. I'm just not comfortable putting my money there."

Fine, I've heard that before. Then, he went on to say, "I have a history of foresight that, if I had acted upon, I would have made a lot of money. I was using eBay very early, but I just didn't have the confidence to invest." And he named several other examples.

So, I asked him, "If you keep having foresight about change and, in hindsight, you were right about your foresight, why don't you ever follow up on the next set of foresigths you have?"

"Ah," he said. "That's why I have a job. People are terrible about changing behavior until they absolutely have to."

As I encounter resistance to the ideas behind blockchain, decentralization, and perhaps more broadly, higher education in the US, I experience a tremendous sense of deja vu.

"We'll never use email."

"We'll never need a web page."

"I'll never need a smartphone."

"I'll never feel comfortable putting my credit card on the Internet."

"I don't see any value in Facebook."

and on and on ...

I've personally heard each of those comments.People don't do well with change. It makes us uncomfortable. I get that. But whether you like it or not, change happens.

And we all need to deal with it. The only question is when.

Preparing for the inevitability of decentralization

I don't know the "when" of how the world moves to greater decentralization of its systems, technology, governments, and more.

There are obviously plenty of entrenched interests of people who don't want that to happen. Just like Sears, Kmart, and others didn't want e-commerce.

But the trendline, at least for me, is clear.

If decentralization is inevitable, a number of industries and institutions will go away in 5, 10, or 20 years.

To some, like the retailers of today, it will come as a surprise. To others — those who spend the time to understand the implications of things like blockchains, decentralized autonomous organizations and crypto-tokens — it will be expected.

We all have a choice as to which group we will be in.

The poster reads: "Missing – Have you seen this person? Laura Palmer disappeared 25 years ago."

At the bottom, there's a phone number in case you have "any information" regarding Laura Palmer. When you call 1300 816 776, you won't get Lucy on the horn but you'll hear the Twin Peaks theme followed by a backward message in a familiar voice. Soundcloud user 'void as' managed to record and reverse the audio.

You can leave a message after the beep, and some people have reported receiving callbacks and text messages after doing so!

It is happening again.

Obviously, Laura Palmer's body was discovered before she was even reported missing, but the aim of this guerilla campaign is clearly to get people stoked on "The Return" of Twin Peaks using what's arguably the show's most iconic image. Laura Palmer's homecoming queen portrait was also featured in Showtime's most recent teaser and poster, but with sightings in Australia only —even before an official poster campaign in the U.S.— these are likely the work of Stan, the streaming company simulcasting the upcoming series starting May 22nd. Stan did not confirm or deny their involvement when Welcome to Twin Peaks reached out for comment. Instead, they clapped their hands once and started dancing.

31 grudnia to dzień, w którym większość z nas przygotowuje się, aby hucznie powitać Nowy Rok. Podczas rozmowy z dziennikarzem Aleksander Kwaśniewski przestrzegał - szczególnie mężczyzn - przed nadużywaniem tego dnia mocnych alkoholi. - Panowie miewają, niestety, taką tendencję, że najpierw przyspieszają tempo, bo kończy się stary rok, potem przyspieszają, bo zaczyna się nowy rok, a kończy się to zawsze fatalnie. Uważam, że w sylwestra najlepiej jest zrezygnować z mocnych alkoholi i raczej sączyć tak zwane long drinki, bo z nimi łatwiej się kontrolować. Najgorzej, gdy człowiek się budzi pierwszego stycznia i nawet nie wie, że to już Nowy Rok - podkreślał.

Były prezydent polecał również, by na imprezę nie wychodzić głodnym, a przed wyjściem zjeść "pożywny obiad". - Może się okazać, że w atmosferze sylwestrowej nie będzie czasu na jedzenie. Wiem, że panie niechętnie to robią, bo kreacje sylwestrowe..., ale z doświadczenia wiem, że warto. Nie pamiętam, żeby kiedykolwiek ktoś mi powiedział, że z sylwestrowej imprezy zapamiętał jakieś świetne danie. W poszukiwaniu wrażeń kulinarnych można sobie pójść do dobrej restauracji w dowolny dzień roku. A tej nocy trzeba tańczyć, bawić się z przyjaciółmi - zaznaczył w rozmowie z Gazetą Telewizyjną.

Na zabawach u państwa Kwaśniewskich obowiązywało kilka zasad. Oto one:

Kwaśniewski, który pełnił funkcję głowy państwa w latach 1995-2005, został też zapytany, jak sylwestra spędza się w roli prezydenta. - To też jest tradycja. Ponieważ wygłaszam orędzie w sylwestra, muszę być tego dnia w Warszawie, w Pałacu Prezydenckim. Od początku uznaliśmy z żoną, że najprzyjemniej będzie, jeśli zaprosimy przyjaciół do siebie. Pierwsze przyjęcia organizowaliśmy w naszych prywatnych apartamentach, ale co roku gości przybywało i teraz nasza prywatka odbywa się piętro niżej - zdradził.

Przyznał, że każdej z takich imprez towarzyszyło kilka zasad. Pierwszą z nich było to, że każdy musiał przynieść ze sobą coś do jedzenia. Po drugie nie zapraszano zespołów ani orkiestr, a muzykę puszczał zaprzyjaźniony DJ, Marek Sierocki. - Trzecią zasadą jest ta, że każdego roku musi być jakaś dodatkowa atrakcja. W zeszłym roku były fajerwerki, ale na nasze nieszczęście chmury były wyjątkowo niskio i niewiele było widać - mówił Kwaśniewski.

Lee is a first-time author who lives in Essex, Connecticut. Her new book is Journey to the Inner Child Workbook: Meditations, Art Therapy, Journaling and Other Techniques. In the book she shares her process of recovering from sexual abuse in her childhood.

She recently joined News Director Dan Katz to talk about the book. Below is a transcript of their conversation.

Melissa, thanks for being with us.

Thank you, Dan, I really appreciate this opportunity.

The book is literally a workbook to help people reconnect with their inner child. It's full of questions, prompts, and activities to do that. First for our listeners, how do you define the inner child?

I think one of the most powerful experiences a person will ever have is meeting their inner child. And the reason for that is because in our childhood often, we have woundings and woundings where pain is creating, and those woundings...if we don't deal with that and repress that, as adults it's gonna come up in patterns in our life that are really unhealthy. Addictions, physical symptoms. Any kind of pain that hasn't been addressed will come up in all those ways.

So I think going into dealing with your inner child is the only way to heal these woundings that are coming out even now in our modern life with all of the media attention around some of these men who have perpetrated against some of these women. And you know, with the sexual harassment. I think a lot of those issues are directly related to unresolved childhood repressed abuse. And until we as individuals do this inner child work, we will continue to embody our childhood traumas as adults and act them out together.

Can you take us through the kind of activities that are in the workbook to help people reconnect with their inner child?

Yeah, one of the most important ones that I believe you should do right away is get a picture of yourself as a child, and every day connect with that inner child by looking into the eyes of the inner child. And start connecting through looking at the energy of what you seem like in the picture, like, look at your eyes, do they seem sad? Do they seem like they're in shock? So by doing that daily, that's going to bring you right back to your...the child that you were growing up.

And by doing that you're going to start to possibly have memories that have been repressed, and emotions come forward into your conscious mind from your unconscious mind. And that is so pertinent because that's gonna show where your pain comes from.

And there's exercises in this book, if you want to do art exercises, there's a whole section in the book that guides you through these exercises using art to connect with your inner child. And if you're having a physical issue, I have a whole section on what you should do with getting in contact with those physical symptoms that are coming up, and that can also be a doorway down into your pain and some probably unconscious traumas from your childhood.

Now this book is based on your own healing process. And it was really later in life that you decided to go on this journey to connect with your inner child. What prompted you to do this?

Panic attacks and physical issues that I was having that no doctor, therapist, healer could help me with. It was this prompting of my own inward journey. Except for one person in Santa Fe, New Mexico, a doctor helped me kind of hold the space for me to really give me the confidence that what I was getting in touch with as far as the inner child was real and some of the memories that were coming up were actually real also.

You lived in Connecticut, Newtown, in a nice place with animals and family...

Uh-huh. I had a wonderful, beautiful life.

But you felt you needed to go on this journey, and that took you to Santa Fe.

That took me to Santa Fe, yeah. It was really quite an inward journey for me to let go of my life I had here in Connecticut for 17 years and go to Santa Fe to heal some of those childhood wounds.

So, you've been doing this work for more than a decade on yourself. How is your relationship with your inner child today?

Well, so much more intact now I would say because I have every single day of my life for twelve years been in touch with my inner child. And basically, have made this my life's work. So, I have so much more joy in my life, and acceptance of who I am.

Because what happens, Dan, when you don't deal with childhood trauma and abuse is that we have these beliefs about ourselves that are actually false beliefs and are usually around our own self-worth. And if we don't deal with that, than we sort of embody that in the victim/perpetrator roles.

And so for me, I was severely abused as a child, had repressed it, didn't come into the knowledge of that until my late 30s, and so I was acting out a victim role all the time with people in my life. And until I did this work, it was really entrenched in my life. Now it's very, very few circumstances where I'm embodying being a victim, and I have come into my power doing this work.

What advice do you have for people who are starting to come forward with their stories that they've held down for so many years?

I would say believe all of the emotions you're getting. So that is my advice. Do not discount it as a figment of your imagination, because it's not. And so, I would say seek someone who has done the work. Seek a therapist or a healer who has done their own work, who has delved deeply into their own pain and knows how to guide and guide you through your own. 'Cause that's really the most important, is owning your own pain and knowing how to do that with another individual. And so that's the advice that I would give them.

As somebody who's gone through the book and has done all the activities I can tell you, doing the Inner Child work has changed the way that I look at life and the way I interact with other people. Thank you, Melissa, for coming in today and sharing your story with everybody.

You're welcome, Dan. I would like to give 100 free books to the first 100 people that get onto my website and leave their information so that I can send them a book.

The Pensacola News Journal reports 27-year-old Amanda Cay Carpenter was charged with animal cruelty and firing a weapon in public following the Dec. 15 incident at a mobile home park in Pensacola.

An Escambia County Sheriff's arrest report says Carpenter told investigators the 9-month-old puppy chewed up and damaged several items in her room. She tried to discipline the dog by putting it in a kennel, but it wouldn't go inside.

The report says Carpenter grabbed the dog and it tried to bite her face. Deputies say she took the dog outside and shot it multiple times.

She remains in jail on a $20,000 bond. Jail records don't list a lawyer.

3am Interview









AN INTERVIEW WITH PAUL SIMONON







"What made a big difference was the open door policy we had. Anyone who wanted to come backstage could, and it was never a problem. I don't know whether other bands did that. It was good for us to meet people who had come to see the group and converse with them, ask them 'What's it like in your town? What, there are no clubs here? So what do you do?' It was about sharing information and it was good to know what was going on out there, and how people were dealing with their lives. And that spread right across the world" Paul Simonon of The Clash talks to Ben Myers



COPYRIGHT © 2004, 3 A.M. MAGAZINE. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED It's all about poise. If you don't have poise - definition: "balance; a dignified and self-assured manner" -- in rock 'n' roll, you're nothing. Paul Simonon had it in abundance. And still does. Look at any footage of The Clash and you're struck by the aesthetic perfection of their bassist; the way in which he just hung there, cool but coiled, aloof but ready. Joe Strummer had the politico credentials and Mick Jones had the Keith Richards flash and swagger and natural musical ability, but Simonon had poise. Born in 1955 he grew up on the streets of Brixton and Ladbroke Grove, often one of the few white faces in black neighbourhoods. His father Gustav was a Communist Party member and art lover, whose appreciation of paintings was passed onto his son at a young age. In the late Sixties -- around about the time that Desmond Dekker was introducing ska sounds and styles to British mods who, in turn, would soon develop the burgeoning skinhead culture -- Simonon spent a year in Rome and Siena when his mother's new partner had won a scholarship to study Italian baroque music. Skipping school, it was here that he saw the great works of the Renaissance masters close-up and his lifelong interest in fine art began. Returning to England in 1969 he became a sharp-suited skin and immersed himself deeply in dub and reggae, as well as the film and soundtracks of the then-popular Spaghetti westerns. Simonon was too smart and multi-cultural to be attracted by the racist undertones of the skins; he was into the sharp lines, the street-tough look and the outlaw stance that would soon become integral to the presentation of The Clash. Despite having no inherent musical ability, his looks, intelligence and attitude were more than enough for Mick Jones and manager Bernie Rhodes to invite him to play bass in the band they put together in 1976. Joe Strummer was poached from London's premier pub rock band The 101ers and The Clash was born. For Simonon it was a task he threw himself into with gusto when he moved straight into Rhodes' Rehearsal Rehearsals at Camden Lock, marking the band's territory with a vast Ballardian mural depiction of the Westway, that looming landmark at the centre of The Clash's psycho-geographic London. With the aid of his dub favourites Simonon mastered the rudimentaries of the bass and within nine months they were a signed band heading the punk vanguard. By the time of 1979's London Calling he had developed into a skilled player, penning such songs as perennial favourite and much-sampled 'Guns Of Brixton', and a thrusting enigmatic presence in the band's increasingly thunderous live shows. Simonon provided the film star glamour to an otherwise motley bunch of home-made haircuts and bad dental work: it was he who developed the band's early paint-splattered Pollock-inspired look and whose fascination with guns and outlaw culture led to their mid-period black military look -- all straps, angular zips and reinforced gussets. Riot gear. Street-fighting togs. And, later, with London Calling and beyond again it was Simonon who looked effortlessly natural in their Golden Age Hollywood suits, hats and overcoats. In the words of Mick Jones, "He was just there, looking fantastic...the bastard." When The Clash split in the mid-80's -- Simonon remained until the bitter end -- he travelled America, recorded the Latin-influenced Havana 3AM album, and dedicated more and more time to his paintings. He now regularly exhibits and is a respected figure in the art world. Equally as importantly, he is producing technically-accomplished paintings that are traditional -- classic, even -- in form, yet stunning enough to find favour amongst a scene cluttered with charlatans and conceptualists. Today he's relaxed, affable, interesting and interested -- everything you'd have hoped for. Once again he finds himself talking about his time with a once-in-a-generation band, a career that ended when Simonon, the youngest band member, was still in his twenties. "The label said they wanted to do a 25 anniversary release of London Callingand, coincidentally around the same time Mick Jones was moving house and came across a box full of tapes," he explains of the recent re-issue and the official reason we're talking today. "He said he recognised them immediately as copies of demo tapes of the album, the originals of which were lost somewhere on the Circle Line in 1979. We thought it would be a good idea to put them on as well, and Kosmo Vinyl, who worked for The Clash in our heyday had been sitting on these video tapes with footage of us making the album in the studio. He thought they'd badly deteriorated and wouldn't be of much use, but we had them sent over anyway and had them checked through. It was on a format that doesn't exist anymore but there was some character somewhere who had a machine that could transfer them. There was a lot of footage of Guy Stevens at work, physically and mentally producing The Clash. So now we've become -- would you believe -- a Sony 'legacy' act. Or is it 'heritage act'? Whatever you want to call it..." 3 AM: How does it feel today, looking back on footage that only previously existed as memories? PS: You do feel displaced in so far as thinking 'Who are those handsome young men?' (laughing). But, yeah, it's strange looking at yesterday and seeing yourself documented in that way. It's shocking but it's hilarious because back then it all seemed normal. At that age you're like an open book because you're less experienced, so when the producer comes in and starts smashing chairs and throwing ladders around you think, 'Oh well, this is what happens...' To a point, anyway. 3 AM: You've said on many occasions that the making of this album was one of the happiest times for you in the studio -- when you came into your own as musician. PS: Really it was Guy's injection of a live energy and enthusiasm that was contagious. We tended to stand up when we were playing a number, and occasionally sit down, but once Guy was in the room there was no time for sitting down because either a chair or ladder might crack you on the head. The thing about London Calling is that it has the quality of a band playing live then and there, which comes down to Guy Stevens, as opposed to the different role of Sandy Pearlman on the previous album [1978's Give 'Em Enough Rope]. Sandy Pearlman was able to extract the live Clash performance and produce it in a very technically spot-on way, whereas Guy's approach was to go in all directions, leave the tape running, charge ahead and everything would be great. Record one song, move onto the next one. Give 'Em Enough Rope is a solid rock record but it was quite different to our debut too. Sandy Pearlman wanted to put the lab coat on and create this supersonic sound, which I think he achieved, but on London Calling Guy was able to translate what we were trying to do in a more human form. 3 AM: As with so many people before me, listening to The Clash document and mythologize London was a major factor in me moving down form the North to the city. I now live in the Camberwell-Peckham area. PS: Well, I know Camberwell very well: I used to go to Camberwell New Baths a lot and the cinema, which used to be the Odeon. My old school is around there too, though you've got to understand that I went to a lot of schools. 3 AM: You made London sound like an adventure playground. 'Guns Of Brixton' was a pretty bleak and violent little commentary, but I thought: 'I want to go there'. PS: Well, you've got your fair share of things going on up North in... where is it?...it sounds like a Durham accent (laughing). You just need someone to sing about it. I suppose you've got Roger Whittaker. Perhaps he could update 'Old Durham Town' into something more contemporary. That was always a big thing with The Clash: writing about what's on your doorstep. But after a while we had become grown men, certainly by London Calling and, having travelled, we had become more worldly and our thoughts more international, as opposed to being eighteen, nineteen, and getting the group to sing about 'Career Opportunities' or 'Garageland'. 3 AM: When did you first become politicised? PS: To be honest, I didn't have much choice. When I was pretty young my dad decided we didn't have to go to Catholic church anymore, and went on to join the Communist Party. But what I couldn't get was how comes I was the one out delivering the leaflets and he was the one at home watching the telly! So I was aware of the political system and also, obviously, because I grew up listening to a lot of reggae -- music that had more edge than a lot of contemporary music as far as political content -- it seemed normal. For Joe it was folk music, people like Woody Guthrie or Bob Dylan. For all of us there was the knowledge that a song can be about things other than love, kissing and...having a nice dance. 3 AM: Was there a lot of discussion in the early days about the band's presentation as a political force, or was it more natural process? PS: Very much. You have to understand that Bernie Rhodes was integral to the birth of The Clash. After rehearsals we'd sit down and ask each other what we wanted out of it and there's that famous line about Terry Chimes replying 'I want a Lamborghini', which was fine for him. But, yeah, we cross-referenced with each other, and asked 'Where are were going? What makes this band different?', rather than 'Let's all get drunk, pull birds and play guitars and that's it'. We wanted more depth, a more human approach. 3 AM: Would the band have been as powerful or effective without the aesthetic edge? A lot of which came from you: the Jackson Pollock clothes, the military look... PS: That was why we had so much trouble with our record company, because they were used to groups who didn't have a clue about where they were going, how they wanted to dress or whatever. But because of Bernie everything needed to be in-house: all ideas came from the group itself, which was why we were such a tight unit in that respect. This was especially true during London Calling because we'd parted with Bernie and left our rehearsal studio in Camden because it belonged to him, the Pistols had split up, Sid had died and we felt quite alone in some ways. We found the place in Pimlico and became even tighter. In this type of environment you get tighter, to the point where you didn't even need to talk when you were playing, because there was a natural communication there. 3 AM: In Johnny Green's book it really becomes apparent how skint the band were at that stage, something perhaps which the punk police and critics failed to recognise as you began to progress form being a punk band to an international rock 'n' roll band. PS: That's it. You could say that our backs were against the wall and we had to get on with the job at hand, which is why the album came out the way that it did. The second album hadn't been very well received and people were throwing accusations around that we'd sold out. 3 AM: You were criticized -- as many political bands are -- for being idealistic, but I've never seen idealism as being a negative thing. It's often from idealism that great ideas flourish. PS: That was up to us -- we could be as idealistic as we liked. If someone knocked us down for that then that was up to them, but it was our group and we did things our way. It might be the wrong way, but at least we were trying: why don't you go and try your way if you think it's better? Better to be idealistic than the opposite... 3 AM: You were the member of The Clash who was actually most friendly with the Sex Pistols and John Lydon's circle of friends. What are your memories? PS: The first time I saw John was at the Nashville. I sort of knew Steve, Paul Cook and Glen Matlock, and I knew of John because Bernie Rhodes talked about him, but had never met him. John seemed like he had a pretty strong attitude towards the audience -- or anybody -- insofar as it wasn't 'Pleased to meet you, this is my little group' and more a case of 'I don't give a toss about you, I'm on the stage and I'll do what I like'. If you think about that period most of the world was still in flares and had long hair, and here's this character with a ripped-up jumper and cropped hair. The first time we had a conversation was outside the Screen On The Green and he was with a bunch of his mates. I went over and asked him if he knew where I could buy some cigarettes and he said (sarcastically) 'Yeah, there's a shop about two miles in that direction'. We giggled at each other, he showed me the shop and it went from there. I haven't seen John in ages, but we seemed to have a respect for each other from the start. We both came from non-musician situations, which might have something to do with it. 3 AM: Were you fans of his later work with PiL? PS: Yeah, I thought it was brave to jump in at the deep end after the Pistols, but that's John, he doesn't do things by half measures. He's always been very clear on where he's going. A lot of people slagged him off for doing the TV thing but I thought it was good to do because people have the wrong idea of him -- like some sort of fat, bean-slurping idiot like in that Alex Cox film [Sid & Nancy]. That pissed me off, making him look like an idiot. Whereas when he did the TV show the rest of the world saw a very sharp, intelligent human being and that surprised a lot of people. They expected him to be a mindless idiot, but John has a fantastic wit, a wicked sense of humour. 3 AM: The Clash were confrontational, but by 1979 punk had dissipated to a degree into a subculture interpreted by many as an excuse for violence. Did you find yourself in any particularly hair situations? PS: Well, we didn't feel particularly comfortable walking the streets of Northern Ireland and having our photos taken dressed in what could have been seen as some new military wing of the British army: black leather jackets, SWAT-style Clash trousers. But the reason we did that session was to really promote the idea of other bands coming over to Belfast to play, because no one would. There was more trouble in the early days too when people didn't quite understand what the group was about. there'd be times you'd come offstage and there'd be darts imbedded in the backdrop (laughing). That's probably why we moved around so much... 3 AM: You set out to change people's ways of thinking and you succeeded in some ways, if only by galvanizing new groups, writers, designers. Do you look back on such achievements with pride? PS: To inspire people, even just for one second, is worth something. To be honest, we were blokes with guitars, and it's unlikely we could change the world, but at eighteen you at least think it's possible -- and it is, but maybe not in the way you first think. The amount of people who come up and say we changed their lives and gave them a whole different concept of how to look at things, is fantastic. I'm not saying we were holier than thou, we were pretty regular blokes. 3 AM: And that's why people got the band: they saw something real they could relate to. PS: What made a big difference was the open door policy we had. Anyone who wanted to come backstage could, and it was never a problem. I don't know whether other bands did that. It was good for us to meet people who had come to see the group and converse with them, ask them 'What's it like in your town? What, there are no clubs here? So what do you do?' It was about sharing information and it was good to know what was going on out there, and how people were dealing with their lives. And that spread right across the world. 3 AM: What are your opinions on The Clash film, Rude Boy? PS: It was a confusing period for us. It's great for the live performances, but I remember on many occasions asking the director what the film was about. Mick and Joe certainly asked the same, and no-one seemed to have much of a clue. The directors were busking it. As a documentation of the time it's fine, with the rise of the National Front and so on, but it's nothing more than that. The story was a bit weak and the whole situation with the black guys in Brixton...I don't know what they were trying to set up but it was a bit unclear and careless. I didn't even know that stuff was being filmed. The film-makers generally just followed us around and put the camera on from time to time. There were a few scenes that were staged or based on a loose sketch of a script, but that was about it. 3 AM: You must get asked the same questions relating to the band day in and day out. Are you happy to talk about The Clash so long after the event? PS: Actually, I don't talk about it all the time and don't really sit around thinking about it, to be honest. But then situations like re-releases or seeing new footage of Guy Stevens is like poking the pond and all the information is floating to the top again. It is a bit odd sometimes talking about it all again. It's like me doing an interview and asking you about your school, you know? It seems so far away. 3 AM: What are you working on at the moment? PS: Right now, I'm working towards another exhibition. It's not going to be London scapes this time. It'll be something very different. I'm busy, I'm productive, and that's what I fancy doing at the moment. Maybe in two years time I might fancy making an album. 3 AM: Really? PS: Maybe, maybe not. I might fancy writing a poem. Who knows! 3 AM: The London scapes were very impressive. I thought the one with Battersea Power Station in the background and the light bursting through the cloud was the strongest one of that series. PS: Thanks. That one was actually my favourite, and it was also the last one to sell, which is strange. But it's on to the next show now. I'm hoping to put it on next year. I'm working away at the moment because I like to get a large collection together so I can pick and choose about which paintings make the grade. I spend a long time pondering which works should be shown, I'm very brutal in my selection. It has to be top notch. 3 AM: Do you have regular working routine when you're painting? PS: Yes, I do. when I was doing the Thames painting I didn't have a studio at the time, so I tended to work outside. Now, though, I'm very fortunate to have a place about five minutes away from where I live and it's under the bloody Westway of all places! I can't get away from that bloody bulk. I remember seeing it being built as a kid and it's still there now. I'll probably be buried underneath it as well. 3 AM: You must have seen a lot of changes in and around Notting Hill/Ladbroke Grove? PS: You're telling me. I'm probably one of the few local yokels still living here -- a lot of people have been priced out. But then again there's a good ecosystem around here, because there's still a lot of the same housing estates, and also a lot of new businesses and fancy shops that have opened up. A couple of blocks away from me it's like Bond Street or something. The rich come in and buy their goods and maybe meet a few of the local trouble makers who might relieve them of a bit of cash, and everybody goes home relatively happy one way or another. 3 AM: That's what makes London so fascinating -- the fact that millionaires can rub against some of the roughest estates in the country. PS: It's mad. But Ladbroke Grove and Portobello has always been like that. If you look in the history books you can see that on one side there was Holland Park with its fancy houses, and on the other side, pig farmers, gypsies and brickies. It's odd. 3 AM: Who are you listening to at the moment? PS: The most recent thing I bought was Dexy's Greatest Hits, but like everyone else I've been listening to The Libertines. I still listen to music, and I still play at home, but not professionally in a club or whatever any more. 3 AM: What type of stuff would you be playing if you want 20 today? Do you think it would be like The Libertines or would it be vastly different? Would you even pick up a guitar? PS: Er...I don't really know. When I did Havana 3am we were veering towards a lot of Latin stuff. It's hard to say because every few years your headset changes. I've had various ideas, but I've put them aside because I'm really just thinking about the painting at the moment. I'm too distracted by art to seriously think about music at the moment. 3 AM: Well, thanks for the time Paul. PS: That's all right, it was nice talking to you. And good luck in Peckham!

Ambassador Walid Abu Ali was summoned back to Ramallah on Saturday, with the Palestinian foreign ministry saying his participation in the rally was "an unintentional mistake, but not justified".

Thousands of Pakistanis attended the mass protest rally organised by Saeed in the northern city of Rawalpindi on Friday, rejecting US President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel earlier this month.

Saeed, the founder of the Lashkar-e-Taiba armed group, has long been accused by the United States and India of masterminding the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which saw gunmen kill 166 people as they stormed hotels and other targets in the Indian financial hub.

Saeed denies any involvement in the attacks and says he only runs the Jamaat-ud-Dawa charitable organisation. The United Nations and the US both designate Jamaat-ud-Dawa and its affiliates as a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba, which frequently carries out attacks targeting Indian security personnel in the disputed region of Kashmir.

India terms attendance 'unacceptable'

The Palestinian ambassador addressed a crowd of thousands at the rally.

"All Pakistani people from all walks of life have strongly rejected Trump's decision of [recognising] Jerusalem as the [Israeli] capital," Ali told Al Jazeera shortly after his speech.

The PA's decision appears to have come after India protested the ambassador's presence at the rally, terming it "unacceptable".

"The spokesman for the Palestinian Foreign Ministry stresses the commitment of the State of Palestine and its keenness to maintain good relations with the friendly Republic of India, as well as its support for the efforts of the Republic of India in its war against terrorism," noted the Palestinian foreign ministry's statement.

"The State of Palestine stands with the Republic of India in dealing with terrorist threats."

India was among 128 UN member states, including Pakistan, to vote for a non-binding resolution rejecting Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel earlier this month.

International sanctions

Saeed's status has long been a thorn in the rocky relationship between Pakistan and India. After being held under house arrest since January, he was released last month by a judicial review board, which deemed the state to have presented insufficient evidence to continue extending his detention.

Saeed is subject to international sanctions for his association with Lashkar-e-Taiba, including UN restrictions that subject him, Jamaat-ud-Dawa and other associated organisations to an asset freeze, arms embargo and international travel ban.

In 2002, Pakistan banned Lashkar-e-Taiba as a "terrorist" organisation, and since 2008, authorities say they have been abiding by UN sanctions. Jamaat-ud-Dawa, however, continues to operate freely across the country and is often seen at the forefront of humanitarian relief efforts following natural disasters. It also runs a network of seminaries and releases several periodical publications.

Late on Saturday, Pakistan defended the decision to allow Saeed's rally in Rawalpindi.

"The public meeting held yesterday was yet another demonstration of the Pakistani strong sentiments in support of the Palestinian cause," said a foreign ministry statement.

"This public rally was attended by thousands of people from all walks of life. More than 50 speakers addressed the rally, including Hafiz Saeed. Contrary to the impression being created, UN proscription does not place any restrictions on the freedom of expression."

Trumpwashing—defined as whitewashing, obscuring or rewriting the broader US record by presenting Donald Trump as an aberration (FAIR.org, 6/3/16)—was on full display Thursday in a nominally straight news report from the New York Times' Mark Landler (12/28/17) on how Trump has reshaped US foreign policy. Buried in the otherwise banal analysis was this gem of US imperial agitprop:

Above all, Mr. Trump has transformed the world's view of the United States from a reliable anchor of the liberal, rules-based international order into something more inward-looking and unpredictable. That is a seminal change from the role the country has played for 70 years, under presidents from both parties, and it has lasting implications for how other countries chart their futures.

There's lots of ideology to unpack here, but let's start with the empirically false assertion that the "world" viewed the United States as a "reliable anchor of the liberal, rules-based international order." Poll (Guardian, 6/15/06) after poll (Pew, 3/14/07) after poll (PRI, 1/3/14) throughout the years has shown that much of the world views the United States as threat to peace, often taking the top spot as the single greatest threat. What evidence Landler has for the world viewing the US as a sort of good-natured global babysitter is unclear, as he cites nothing to support this hugely important claim (since if Trump's cynical disregard for "human rights" is nothing new, then there's no real story here). It's just thrown out with the assumption the Times readership is sufficiently nationalistic and/or amnesiac to either not notice or not care. It's designed to flatter, not to elucidate.

The US invasion of Iraq in defiance of international rules.

The second dubious assertion is the idea that the US is "viewed" as being (or, by implication, objectively is) concerned with "liberal, rules-based international order." Perhaps Landler missed the part where the US runs offshore penal colonies for untried political prisoners, and a decade-long drone war that's killed thousands—both entirely outside the scope of international law. Or the time the US invaded and destroyed Iraq without any international authorization, killing hundreds of thousands. Or perhaps he missed the part where the United States refuses to sign "liberal, rules-based international order" treaties such as the International Criminal Court or the ban on bombs and or a prohibition on nuclear weapons. Or the part where the US not only doesn't recognize the International Criminal Court, but has a law on its books (dubbed "the Hague Invasion Act," passed in 2002) that if an American is ever held by the ICC for committing war crimes, the US is obligated to literally invade the Hague and free them.







And this is just in the past 15 years. Landler starts the clock in 1947, which would include dozens of non-"liberal," non-"rules-based" coups, invasions, bombing campaigns, assassinations, extrajudicial murders and so forth. The number of actions carried out by the US not sanctioned by even the thinnest pretext of "international order" is too long to list.

What exactly is this "liberal, rules-based international order," and when did the world view the United States as its most reliable anchor? Landler doesn't say, he simply asserts this highly contestable and ideological claim, and moves on to pearl-clutch about Trump ruining the US's hard-won moral authority. He has some 100 percent uncut pro-US ideology to push under the guise of criticizing Trump, and no amount of basic historical facts will get in his way.These things look quite nice, as you might expect, with a reasonably high RGB LED density under the light diffuser, two-tone heat spreaders and pleasing design. The memory itself is also high perfoamance, running at 3200MHZ with tight latency timings. Note that you will have to go in to your motherboard settings and manually set up the memory speed, either directly or through the XMP profile.



Please note, however, that I run a Ryzen system - I wasn't aware of this before I made this purchase and had to do a lot of troubleshooting, but Ryzen systems (particularly 1st gen) do not play nice with high speed memory. After much tweaking and overvolting, mine runs stable but only at 3066Mhz.

I am not factoring this in to my review score, as this was a lack of research and user error on my part - but if you are buying this for a Ryzen system, consider saving money and buying the 3000Mhz kit instead. Most ryzen systems flake out above a memory frequency of 2988Mhz or so, so buying a 3200Mhz set of memory is likely to not work properly at its rated speeds unless they are made specifically for Ryzen - which these are not.

The silicon lottery does factor in to this, so you might be able to get high speed memory to work fine for you, but I could not.Enter the characters you see below

The Department of Justice sent a letter to the Census Bureau asking if it was possible to include a question on citizenship for the 2020 census.

The citizenship question would be used to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, says DoJ.

The Hill:

"To fully enforce those requirements, the Department needs a reliable calculation of the citizen voting-age population in localities where voting rights violations are alleged or suspected," the letter said. However, critics say including a question on immigration could prevent immigrants from participating in the census due to fears the government could use the information against them. The letter was drafted by Arthur Gary, a lawyer at the DOJ, to Census Bureau official Dr. Ron Jarmin. A spokesperson for the Census Bureau confirmed the letter to ProPublica, saying the "request will go through the well-established process that any potential question would go through." The Hill has reached out to the Justice Department for comment. The letter comes after reports in recent months that the Trump administration plans to include an immigration-related question in the census.

I fail to see how such a question could generate controversy. Illegal aliens are already very distrustful of the census so it's hard to see how one question would make it worse. They really needn't worry. The Census Bureau cannot share information from the census with Homeland Security or any other federal agency due to confidentiality laws.

Instead of getting hysterical about adding the citizenship question, perhaps illegal alien advocates could explain to them they are in no danger of discovery from the Census Bureau. That would be a far more productive use of their time and energy.

Since illegals have no voting rights, counting them in a citizenship census would seem to be superfluous. Even legal residents cannot vote in federal elections, So there is a legitimate question about whether the census even needs to know the citizenship status of the people it counts.In a rare in-person episode, Tim and Joe speculate about how technological trends will shape the future of cities.

That post was surprisingly popular - and I've had repeated requests for a follow-up. Now that well over a year has passed, I think the time is right for a new installment, and one spanning a far greater time period than the month-long data set I used to compile the last version.

This time, I'll be showing you which devices were the most popular across the whole of 2017. And, of course, I'll show you some of the outliers, to give you a sense of how some devices have fallen (or never grown) from the ranks.

Methodology

A quick note on methodology. This data is compiled using Google Analytics, which allows you to sort traffic by mobile device. For devices that have a different browser user agent for every SKU, I will combine those SKUs as best I can to provide a more accurate picture of that phone's popularity. (This is particularly an issue with Samsung devices.)

Unfortunately, about 7% of our mobile device visitors don't register as a particular device, whether because of their browser or because the manufacturer of the phone left the field undefined. We don't believe this will materially impact the rankings, though. Without further delay, let's get to the data.

The top 10 (but really 12) devices

Last time I did a post like this, I also listed the top 12, not 10, devices browsing Android Police. The reason I did that is about to become obvious. Anyway, here they are, and this time I'm even going to provide the percentage-point share each device makes up of our mobile traffic.

iPhone (7.37%)* Nexus 6P (5.36%) Pixel XL (5.09%) Pixel (4.07%) Galaxy S7 edge (3.86%) OnePlus 3/3T (3.07%) Galaxy S7 (3.02%) Nexus 5X (2.76%) iPad (2.61%)* Galaxy S8+ (2.23%) Galaxy S8 (1.91%) Galaxy Note5 (1.42%)

*As you may know, Apple uses a single user agent for every model of iPhone it has ever made. This means that 7.37% includes ALL THE IPHONES, which obviously makes it a bit misleading to say the iPhone is the most popular device used to browse Android Police, unless you mean, once again, ALL THE IPHONES. Same goes for the iPad.

In order to keep things interesting, I'm also going to show you the data for the month of December only, which should give you a sense of where things are trending as we head into the new year.

iPhone (9.06%)* Pixel 2 XL (7.17%) Pixel XL (4.38%) Pixel 2 (3.89%) Pixel (3.78%) Galaxy S8 (3.42%) Galaxy S8+ (3.35%) Galaxy Note8 (2.89%) Galaxy S7 (2.88%) iPad (2.71%)* Galaxy S7 edge (2.68%) Nexus 6P (2.28%)

The least popular, and oddities

This section isn't so much about hard numbers as it is to look at some of the oddities and answer the inevitable "Hey, where's [X phone]?" question. We'll only be looking at the full 2017 data set here, but I think you'll find it interesting regardless.

LG fans aren't the biggest fans of us

The first LG phone in our annualized data doesn't appear until well past position 50 in the rankings on our chart, and it's the LG V20 (a measly 0.20% of all traffic). Next after that is the G6, about ten positions lower, followed by the... G4? I guess the G5 really was that bad - it doesn't show up until well past the 120 mark.

Combining all of the V20's various model numbers, it does at least bubble up to somewhere around the top 30. The same goes for the G6. That still puts it well below its Samsung competition.

And the V30? It doesn't even appear anywhere in the top 500. Yikes.

Moto's budget fare still does OK

While you may not have seen a single Moto device in our top lists, the Moto G4 sits somewhere around position 15 in our rankings, and the G5 Plus is in the top 30. The first Z device, the original 2016 Moto Z, sits just outside the top 30, with the original Z Play just behind it.

HTC is not doing so hot

The HTC 10 is the most popular HTC device on Android Police, not quite breaking into the top 50. The next most popular? The One... M8. Yeah. That's kind of sad.

Your real question, of course, is where the U11 falls. It's not pretty: just around position number 150. Still better than the V30!

Sony is a non-factor

The most popular Sony Xperia device on Android Police was released in 2015 - well over two years ago. It's the Xperia Z5, and it's well shy of breaking into the top 100. Next are the Z5 Compact and XZ, and beyond that, you'll just find despair. To be fair, Android Police is a US-focused website, and Sony does absolutely nothing to market its smartphones here. Still, when you wonder why we aren't going out of our way to review the latest and greatest from Sony, there's your reason.

Xiaomi is lurking

A good handful of Xiaomi devices are in the top 100 visiting Android Police, with the Redmi Note 4 being the most popular, at around position 20 in our rankings. The Redmi Note 3, Redmi 3S, Mi 5, Redmi 4, Mi A1, and Mi Max also managed to make it in the 100 most popular devices on AP, with that list being in order of most to least used.

Old Nexuses never die

The number of you using old Nexus devices always baffles me. The Nexus 5 is still nearly in the top 15 devices on the site (and the Nexus 6 is), and we still received visits from a shocking number of 2013 Nexus 7s (more than we did from HTC 10s, I'll tell you that much). Perhaps a testament to the little tablet's popularity, we received about twice as many visitors with Nexus 7s last year as we did Nexus 9s. The only other Nexuses still lurking in the top 500 are the Nexus 4 and Nexus 10, with the latter still sitting around the 200th position.

That's all for now

I'm going to go ahead and call this our year-end post. So, with that, we here at Android Police wish you a happy new year, and look forward to bringing you lots of cool stuff in 2018.For over a year, Google has been developing an operating system named 'Fuchsia,' designed to run across a wide array of devices. The company hasn't said anything publicly about it, but it is entirely open-source, so development on the project has been transparent. Simply put, we can see what Google is working on, but we don't know what it will actually be used for.

According to Fuchsia's documentation, the Acer Switch Alpha 12 and Intel NUC are officially supported 'target' devices. This means that Fuchsia has been verified to work on those devices, and they are most likely the top devices used for testing. A page about installing Fuchsia on the Google Pixelbook was recently added, which explains the process of placing the laptop in developer mode and booting from a USB drive.

Does this prove that Fuchsia will someday replace Chrome OS? Definitely not. However, it does mean that Google wants to make sure the OS works on high-end laptops, like the Pixelbook. Will Fuchsia end up as a stable operating system that runs across a wide array of computers/tablets/phones, or simply a Google pet project that is eventually abandoned? Only time will tell.Story about Emiya family's cuisine previewed in New Year's special

BARTOW, Fla. (AP) — A Florida judge says a sheriff's office must retain custody of a horse whose owner was charged with drunken driving while riding the animal.

In a report by The Ledger , Polk County Judge Sharon Franklin said 53-year-old Donna Byrne was unfit to care for the horse. Franklin also said Byrne must complete treatment for alcohol addiction.

Byrne was arrested Nov. 2 after riding her horse down a highway. Police said her blood-alcohol level twice Florida's legal limit.

Byrne's attorney, Craig Whisenhunt, says he will revisit the custody issue at a Jan. 11 hearing regarding additional pending charges of disorderly intoxication, animal endangerment and culpable negligence.

Whisenhunt questions whether the charges applied to Byrne, saying she had not been disorderly and was a pedestrian under the law.

Information from: The Ledger (Lakeland, Fla.), http://www.theledger.comIn the last few years, though, we have seen retrospectives for Yayoi Kusama, Agnes Martin, Carmen Herrera, Alma Thomas, Marilyn Minter, to name a few. While women may not yet have achieved parity with men, it is promising that artists Vija Celmins, Adrien Piper, Sally Mann all have major retrospectives scheduled for 2018.

On the flip side, male artists and men of power in the art world are being called out for misogynistic behavior and sexual misconduct. The long list of male celebrities accused of sexual misconduct in 2017 is depressing, and the art world is not excluded. Two weeks ago, painter Chuck Close apologized (sort of) after facing allegations from several women that he sexually harassed them when they came to his studio to pose for him. The Chuck Close incident came on the heels of Knight Landesmen, the publisher of Artforum, stepping down after accusations of sexual harassment from 9 women.

Of course, misogyny in art is also not unique to 2017. Back in 2013, artist Georg Basilitz told a reporter from Der Spiegel that "Women don't paint very well." In a 2015 interview with the Guardian, he doubled down claiming "the market doesn't lie," leaving us with no doubt of his backward, sexist stance.

If the positive attention being brought to female artists could potentially increase the value of their work, how will the negative attention earned by some male artists potentially impact the perception of their work both culturally and economically? I don't think it can be positive based on how we have responded to top performers, actors, and musicians like Bill Cosby, Kevin Spacey, and others. Whether you or I agree or disagree with devaluing art for it either being perceived as misogynistic, racist, lewd, insensitive, or offensive, it is already happening. Look at these stories from 2017:

Of course it needs to be said that freedom of expression, fighting censorship, and addressing difficult subject matter are some of the most important functions of art in our society. Equally important is the public response, which sometimes includes protests and public outrage, as it should. Without public response, positive or negative, art risks getting locked in a dangerous self-indulgent echo chamber. The art-loving public are engaging, and are pushing back against the display of work they feel is either cruel, insensitive, or does not reflect the world they want to live in. I predict now more than ever, pressure on artistic institutions and collectors driven by a more participatory "social" media will increasingly reshuffle who we value and how we value art and artists.

#2 Consolidation of the online art marketPitkin County Deputy Kent Taylor on Friday helps guard the entrance to the home near Aspen where Vice President Mike Pence is staying.

Jason Auslander / The Aspen Times |

For Vice President Mike Pence, the message was unmistakable and the banner that carried it unmissable.

"Make America Gay Again," the rainbow banner reads.

Neighbors of the home near Aspen where Pence and his wife, Karen Sue, are staying posted the message Wednesday or Thursday on a stone pillar that sits at the end of driveways to both homes, Pitkin County Sheriff's Deputy Michael Buglione said Friday.

"You couldn't miss it," he said of the sign off Owl Creek Road, adding that the man and woman who live in the home brought chili and corn muffins to deputies and Secret Service agents posted at the foot of the driveway.

The Secret Service agents were not at all perturbed about the banner, Buglione said.

Pitkin County Sheriff Joe DiSalvo said one of his deputies was present when the man who lives in the home came out and first draped the banner over the stone pillar.

"He was real sheepish and thought he might be confronted by the Secret Service or deputies who'd tell him he couldn't do it," DiSalvo said. "When they said, 'We're not here to control your free speech rights,' they came out with chili and began feeding them.

"They've been really nice to us."

The residents of the home did not answer the door or respond to a note left Friday asking for comment about the banner. However, late Friday night, a resident of the home emailed The Aspen Times a brief correction to DiSalvo's comment.

"(The banners) were actually hung by the daughters of the couple who live in the home, and one of their girlfriends (I'm one of them!) with the full support of their parents," Shannon Slade wrote in the email.

The Pence family, who arrived Tuesday, is expected to leave Aspen on Monday and head back to the Eagle County Airport.

Pence, a former member of Congress and governor of Indiana, has described himself as a "Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order."

As governor, he signed a law that members of the gay community said encouraged discrimination against them, though he eventually also signed an amendment to that law that protects that community. Pence also has opposed a law prohibiting discrimination against LGBT people in the workplace, was against the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" and once equated marriage equality with "societal collapse."

President Donald Trump has joked that Pence "wants to hang" all gay people, according to an October article in the New Yorker.

DiSalvo said he fully supports anyone exercising their First Amendment rights and said Aspenites have a history of expressing their opinions to powerful people who visit the area. He specifically brought up the intrepid daredevil who climbed the large blue spruce tree next to the Castle Creek Bridge and hung a sign that read, "Inhale To The Chief" when then-President Bill Clinton visited Aspen in the mid-1990s.

"This town had a history of irreverence when it came to our visitors," DiSalvo said. "We seem to have lost that a bit, but this is an extension of that."

jauslander@aspentimes.comBeijing may have turned a corner in its battle against the city's notorious smog, according to Reuters calculations, and environmental consultants say the Chinese government deserves much of the credit. In China's latest tough anti-pollution measure, it is halting sales of 553 models of vehicles that don't meet fuel-consumption standards.



The halt in production of those 553 models will begin Jan. 1, the China Vehicle Technology Service Center said in a statement Thursday that was reported by Bloomberg News. On the list are models from Audi, Beijing Benz and Chevrolet.



China has tackled its chronic pollution problem by implementing curbs to steel production, restricting coal usage, and its multiyear plan to phase out vehicles powered by fossil fuels. But this is its first official ban of a specific list of polluting vehicles, said Wang Liusheng, a Shanghai-based analyst at China Merchants Securities.



"To emphasize a cut back on energy consumption, such documents will surface frequently in the future," Wang said in an email to Bloomberg. "It's an essential move to ensure the healthy development of the industry in the long run."



It's unclear how many distinct vehicles are produced in China, but the 553 models form a "very small" percentage said Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association.

The Chinese capital is set to record its biggest improvement in air quality in at least nine years, with a nearly 20 percent change for the better this year, based on average concentration levels of hazardous breathable particles known as PM2.5.

The dramatic change, which has occurred across North China, is partly because of favorable weather conditions in the past three months but it also shows that the government's strong-arm tactics have had an impact.

The Reuters' estimates show that average levels of the pollutants in the capital have fallen by about 35 percent from 2012 numbers, with nearly half the improvement this year.

"The improvement in air quality is due both to long-term efforts by the government and short-term efforts this winter," said Anders Hove, a Beijing-based energy consultant. "After 2013, the air in summers got much cleaner, but winter had not shown much improvement. This year is the first winter improvement we've seen during this war on pollution."

Government officials this week signaled they were confident they were starting to get on top of the problem.

"The autumn and winter period is the most challenging part of the air pollution campaign. However, with the intensive efforts all departments have made, we believe the challenge is being successfully overcome," Liu Youbin, spokesman for the Ministry of Environmental Protection, told reporters on Thursday.

But environmental experts say that while they are optimistic, it may be too early to celebrate.

"The turning point is here but we cannot rule out the possibility we can turn back," said Ranping Song, developing country climate action manager for the World Resources Institute. "We need to be cautious about challenges and not relax now that there have been improvements. There are lots of issues to be solved."

And while China has scored an initial victory over smog, it still has to reverse public opinion outside China on its air quality.

New York-based travel guidebook publisher Fodor's advised tourists in mid-November in its 'No List" for 2018 to shun Beijing until the city's anti-pollution campaign had reduced the "overwhelming smog." Fodor's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In Beijing there is certainly plenty of room for further progress as average air quality is still significantly worse than the World Health Organization's recommendations.

And the region still sees bouts of heavy smog. On Friday afternoon the U.S. embassy's website said Beijing's air was "very unhealthy" and the city issued a pollution alert on Thursday.

The Reuters calculations showing the improvement were based on average hourly readings of PM2.5 concentrations at the United States Embassy in Beijing from April 8, 2008 to Dec. 28, 2017. The data were compiled from figures from the U.S. embassy's air monitoring website, as well as data provided by AirVisual, a Beijing company that analyses air quality data.

The data from the embassy, though not fully verified or validated, is the only set available for PM2.5 levels in the capital over that time period. AirVisual provided the hour-by-hour air pollution data from the embassy for recent months.

PM2.5 levels are the most closely monitored because they account for the majority of air pollutants in China and can be harmful to the body when breathed.

Beijing's air was actually worse in the first nine months of this year than in the same period last year, but PM2.5 concentrations from October to Dec. 28 this year were nearly 60 percent lower than last year, the Reuters figures show.

Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner Huang Wei said that less than half of the improvement is due to favorable weather — particularly stronger northerly winds and low humidity — with the government's policies behind most of the change.

The Chinese government launched a winter smog "battleplan" in October for 28 northern cities that called for strict rules on emissions during the winter heating months when pollution typically worsens.

The authorities also sought to make sure that Beijing wasn't too polluted during October's Communist Party congress, which is only held once every five years, at which Xi Jinping consolidated his power as the nation's leader. Some of the more-polluting businesses in and around the capital were told to shut down for a period before and during the gathering.

The plan for the winter months included switching millions of households and some industrial users to natural gas from coal for their heating and some other needs. There were also mandated cuts in steel production by up to 50 percent in some of the areas surrounding the city.

Beijing's improving air quality stands in stark contrast to India's capital New Delhi, where pollution has steadily become worse over the past few years, and is now well above Beijing's.

China's improvement, and deterioration in some other countries, means China is now not among the ten worst countries for pollution in the world anymore, according to at least one measure.

"At the national level, India tops the index rankings, followed by Bangladesh and Thailand," said Richard Hewston, global head of environment and climate change at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, which measures 198 countries for air quality.

Earlier this month, Facebook announced it would be using facial recognition to let users know every time a photo of them had been uploaded to the site.

Such a feature would be extremely useful to one man - public-relations professional Jonathan Hirshon, who has managed to stay anonymous online for the past 20 years.

He has more than 3,000 friends on Facebook and regularly updates his profile with personal information - where he is going on holiday, what he has cooked for dinner and the state of his health.

But what he has never shared on the social network, or anywhere else online, is a picture of himself.

It is, he said, his way of "screaming my privacy to the world".

"I choose to share virtually everything about myself on social media, but my face is the essence of me individually and this is about refusing to give up the last piece of identifiable information that I can control."

One of the big debates of 2018 is going to be around our personal information - how we share it, what Facebook, Amazon and Google do with it and what should happen when it is stolen or hacked.

Part of that discussion will be played out in tough new EU laws coming into force in May, which aim to give citizens back control of their data.

Some believe the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will turn personal data into a commodity - as valuable as oil - that citizens can share and sell for their own benefit.

Mr Hirshon wishes the US would instigate similar laws but is doubtful that it will immediately lead to citizens getting rich on their own information.

"I'm totally in favour of it but in order to accomplish that, people will have to totally change their mindset when using social media.

"Right now, we enjoy them as [a] totally free service monetised by ads targeted very specifically at us because the services know so much about us.

"Until such time as we choose to pay for these services, when [we have] the option of keeping our data private and monetising it ourselves, the idea will remain just that - an idea."

He is also well aware that the internet is the least anonymous place on Earth.

"Privacy is an illusion - the reality is that as you go across the internet, you leave traces of yourself everywhere."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Upcoming European data laws are intended to make our digital footprints more transparent

Twenty five years ago - when the internet was in its infancy - he made "a conscious decision" to keep his picture off the web.

"It began as a game, to see how long I could do it for," he said. "And 25 years later it is still working."

He clearly enjoys the status of being the internet's mystery man.

"When people ask me why I do it, I give them four options. One: I am shy. Two: I used to work as a spy. Three: I am on the witness protection programme. Four: all of the above."

"I refuse to confirm or deny which one is the truth."

Image copyright Jonathan Hirshon Image caption Mr Hirshon's current profile picture on Facebook

At a recent conference on the issue, Facebook's deputy head of privacy, Stephen Deadman, described GDPR as the biggest single change for Facebook since it was founded.

Julian Saunders, chief executive of personal data dashboard PORT.im said: "This is a massive, groundswell change in the relationship between businesses and people.

"Data is power, which is something that firms have known for a long time. Now, the boot is on the other foot."

"Individuals will be in much better position to know where their data is used and who it is being shared with."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Our faces are increasingly being used as data points

Increasingly, our faces are becoming part of our personal data footprint.

Facial recognition has been used by Facebook since 2010 to identify and tag users.

Credit card companies are looking at using selfies to allow people to pay for things, while schools are considering the technology to check attendance and law enforcement already turns to it to track down criminals.

Apple's latest phone, the iPhone X, uses facial recognition to identify the owner and keep the handset safe.

Perhaps surprisingly, Mr Hirshon is open to the idea.

"I need to upgrade my phone and I want to replace it with an iPhone X."

"I trust Apple with my data. Many of the points of facial recognition are kept locally on the phone. Apple doesn't get that information."

But he is clear about one thing.

"I wouldn't buy a Google phone."

From people taking selfies to tourists on the lookout for the perfect shot, the offline world is now full of people snapping pictures.

And digital copies will often follow as sharing our lives on Instagram and other social networks becomes a normal part of the daily routine.

"I have learned to turn my head when I'm in a crowd," said Mr Hirshon.

He regularly speaks at conferences - places he regards as "high risk" for his online anonymity crusade.

His first slide - no matter what the topic he is speaking about - is always a picture of a camera with a red slash through it.

He also asks the organisers to remind the audience that no-one should take and post a picture of him online.

Staying anonymous is quite a job.

He regularly trawls the internet looking for pictures that may have escaped his notice, but remarkably in 25 years has found only two.

Both occurred after events he was speaking at - in Serbia and Croatia - and the photos appeared on Twitter.

"I raced to find bilingual friends in both instances to send an urgent tweet respectfully asking on my behalf to take the picture down.

"Both were happy to do so and apologised profusely for the error. Nothing done out of malice, just language issues."

He is realistic though about maintaining his facial anonymity.

"It will end eventually, but when it does I have a solution which I call the Spartacus hack."

In the 1960s film, the slave's identity was protected when many of his fellow slaves stood up and declared: "I'm Spartacus."

Mr Hirshon has adapted that idea for the digital age.

"A couple of years ago, I asked friends to tag pictures of random people, animals, minerals with my name and flood Google with them.

"So now, when one picture slips through the net, it won't matter because you are not going to be able to tell which one is me."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important

The Palestinians have announced they are recalling their envoy to the United States for "consultations", weeks after President Trump recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he would not accept any US peace plan in the wake of Mr Trump's move.

Protests and clashes broke out in the Gaza Strip after the announcement.

A UN resolution calling on the US to cancel the decision was backed overwhelmingly by the General Assembly.

Thirteen Palestinians have died in violence since Mr Trump's announcement, most killed in clashes with Israeli forces.

Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Maliki was recalling the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) envoy Husam Zomlot, Palestinian news agency Wafa said.

The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Israel occupied the east of the city, previously occupied by Jordan, in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital.

The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks.

On Sunday Mr Abbas called Jerusalem the "eternal capital of the Palestinian people".

Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries currently maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. However, President Trump has told the US state department to start work on moving the US embassy.Image copyright Getty Images

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is shutting down at the end of 2017, having brought to justice some of those who committed war crimes in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.

Since then, war crimes have been committed in many other parts of the world, in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. Is there evidence that the perpetrators would face a trial at an international court?

War criminals have some reasons to be scared of international justice, but not enough reasons to make them very afraid.

The effort to establish a system of global justice which could deprive war criminals of any hope of escape is a vivid illustration of what can be achieved by nation states acting together. But equally, the refusal of some of the most powerful nations to participate, notably China and the United States, shows how such effort can be hugely undermined.

I missed the trials at Nuremberg by quite a few years but in April 1995, as I was taking my place with the press at The Hague court to report the first case in front of the the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, I sensed powerful echoes from 1945 of the Nuremberg process and that historic demonstration of a will to pursue war criminals under international law.

One eminent British reporter of the Bosnian war complained that the first accused, Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic, was a mere foot soldier of genocide: a prison guard, not an army commander or a political leader. I felt that missed the point. True, this was a small trial, of a single individual. True, the Nuremberg precedent was now being run in reverse.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic (r) talks to his lawyer (l) in 1995 at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague

But after the conviction of Tadic, the tribunal steadily increased its reach, up to the very highest levels of culpability including to former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic himself.

The court demonstrated that - at least in the cases it heard - impunity had been overcome.

So, now that the doors of the Yugoslav tribunal have finally closed, more than 20 years after that first prosecution, what are the prospects for following its example by demonstrating a lasting and far wider commitment to international criminal justice?

Target Africa?

Well, there is now the first International Criminal Court (ICC). Creating it was slow work, because it required agreement among a substantial number of states.

The treaty to establish the court was adopted by 120 states back in July 1998. It then took four years to achieve ratification by half that number of countries in 2002 and thus legitimise the court.

Since then, the achievement has been very limited.

The court says its judges have issued 31 arrest warrants. So far, 25 cases have been before the court and the judges have issued verdicts in six of those cases, resulting in nine people being convicted and one acquitted.

One of the most common accusations levelled against the ICC is that it might be better renamed the African Criminal Court: a weapon used largely by former colonial powers from Europe to punish a single continent and ignore other conflicts.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Burundians take to the streets to celebrate Burundi's withdrawal from the ICC in October 2017

None of this is to suggest that there haven't been shocking genocides and terrible crimes against humanity in Africa, but the continent does have a reasonable record of active participation in, and support for, the ICC. Of 123 countries who are parties to the International Criminal Court, 33 are African states.

But elsewhere in the world there are glaring omissions from the list committed to the ICC, including three of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council: China, Russia and the United States. Oh, and Iraq isn't a participant, either.

Why no Iraq prosecutions?

When you remember that the court can investigate alleged crimes committed since the middle of 2002, the war in Iraq stands out for its startling absence from the ICC case list. The original US-led invasion of Iraq was launched on 20 March 2003 after all. The war dragged on for eight years, and the violence still hasn't ceased.

But the United States has never supported the court. Starting with Bill Clinton, every president has refused to countenance the idea that a US citizen, still less an American soldier, could ever be put before the court.

One of many arguments the US makes for its boycott is that Americans would be targeted mischievously for political purposes. Another is that no court outside the American judicial system can occupy a higher place than its own tribunals.

All this helps shine a bit of a spotlight on one preliminary investigation which is being pursued by the ICC into allegations against soldiers in Iraq from the United Kingdom, America's foremost ally.

In December 2017, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court said there was a "reasonable basis" to believe British troops had committed war crimes against Iraqi detainees.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption ICC Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said British troops might have committed war crimes in Iraq

Consider also the fact that Britain's Ministry of Defence has been found by the High Court in London to be in breach of the Geneva Conventions and ordered to pay damages of tens of thousands of pounds to four Iraqi citizens for their ill-treatment and unlawful detention by British armed forces during the Iraq War. That must make the possibility of the ICC actively pursuing British soldiers at some point in the future more likely.

While all that might seem to be just, it does raise many other questions. How can the ICC have global credibility when major powers including the United States simply refuse to have anything to do with it?

The Syria question

Will the ultimate test of the ICC be its ability to investigate and then prosecute successfully some of the many hundreds, possibly thousands, of people who must have been involved in the systematic crimes against humanity committed during the war still going on in Syria?

The gathering of evidence is said to be happening on a vast scale. Much of it is very deliberately being kept secret, partly to prevent efforts to discredit it, or to kill witnesses or protect the guilty, including those at the very highest levels in Syria.

Is it likely those most culpable will eventually be brought to The Hague?

It doesn't look that likely. Russia, another refusenik which wants nothing to do with the ICC, would have to consent to a peace in Syria without extracting some guarantee of amnesty covering its principal ally, President Bashar al-Assad himself.

It is certainly possible to believe that the ICC is better than nothing, that just because the court's reach and effectiveness is severely limited, that doesn't nullify its achievements so far.

But it is hard to make the case that the pursuit of the most terrible crimes is being conducted as a universal and equitable search for justice, truth and reconciliation.Image copyright Google

Four young children have been left "terrified" after they witnessed a "horrific" shooting of a man in a house in west Belfast, police have said.

The paramilitary-style gun attack happened on Cavendish Street at about 19:45 GMT on Saturday.

Three men entered a house and struck the man on the head before using a handgun to shoot him in both knees and his right ankle.

The victim, who is 28, is in hospital receiving treatment to his injuries.

A woman in the house who saw what happened was also assaulted.

'Attacks not acceptable'

Det Sgt Kelly, of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, said it was a "brutal attack in a busy residential area" and showed how "criminal groups seek to control communities through fear and violence".

"The residents, including young children, have been left terrified by these events," he added.

Sinn Féin councillor Ciaran Beattie said the attack happened in a residential area and people had been left shocked.

"I condemn these type of shootings outright - there's no place for these actions in our society at all," he said.

"The people responsible need to end these actions immediately and cease what they're doing.

"It's not wanted by the community - these attacks aren't acceptable at all."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rajinikanth said that if he did not enter politics "the guilt will haunt me"

Indian film superstar Rajinikanth, who has a huge following in the country and is one of Asia's highest paid actors, has announced he is entering politics.

The 67-year-old, who works mostly in Tamil cinema, said that he will "form my own political party" ahead of the next Indian state assembly election.

Rajinikanth said it was his "duty to change the system" in Tamil Nadu state.

The state has been politically unstable since the death last year of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa Jayaram.

Jayalalitha was also a former film star.

Addressing a packed hall of cheering supporters in the southern Indian city of Chennai (formerly Madras) on Sunday, Rajinikanth said that his aim was to contest "all 234 seats" in the assembly.

"If I don't take this decision now, the guilt will haunt me," he said, adding: "I am not doing it for any post or money or fame as I have enough."

Fans let off fire-crackers, danced to music and shouted slogans of support following the announcement, AFP news agency reports.

Rajinikanth's entrance into politics was widely anticipated after the actor dropped several hints that he was considering the move.

In May, Rajinikanth told his fans to be "ready for war" at the right time to take on the "corrupt" political system and a "rotten" democracy.

"If God wills, I will enter politics tomorrow. If I do, I will be truthful and will not entertain the corrupt people," he said at the time.

Tamil Nadu state plunged into crisis after the death of its former chief minister in December 2016. It eventually led to a split in the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party, or AIADMK.

Who is Rajinikanth?

Image caption The Tamil actor is one of Asia's best-paid stars

Referred to simply as "The Superstar" in his native Tamil Nadu state, Rajinikanth famously worked as a bus conductor in the southern Indian city of Bangalore before heading to Chennai in 1973 to pursue an acting career.

He has a devoted fan base in the state, which is home to more than 70 million people.

Rajinikanth, whose real name is Shivaji Rao Gaekwad, has appeared in close to 200 films since 1975, many of which have broken box-office records.

In 2016, his film Kabali swept India with hundreds of thousands of fans flocking to cinemas across the country.

Businesses gave employees time off to avoid "sick" days, a jumbo jet was repainted in honour of the film and Twitter India "broke" several times.

The film made $30m (£20m) in rights sales before it was even released.Image caption Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important

Researchers in London have developed scanning techniques that show what is written on the papyrus that mummy cases are made from.

These are the decorated boxes into which the wrapped body of the deceased was placed before it was put in a tomb.

They are made from scraps of papyrus which were used by ancient Egyptians for shopping lists or tax returns.

The technology is giving historians a new insight into everyday life in ancient Egypt.

The hieroglyphics found on the walls of the tombs of the Pharaohs show how the rich and powerful wanted to be portrayed. It was the propaganda of its time.

The new technique gives Egyptologists access to the real story of Ancient Egypt, according to Prof Adam Gibson of University College London, who led the project.

"Because the waste papyrus was used to make prestige objects, they have been preserved for 2,000 years," he said.

"And so these masks constitute one of the best libraries we have of waste papyrus that would otherwise have been thrown away so it includes information about these individual people about their everyday lives"

The scraps of papyrus are more than 2,000 years old. The writing on them is often obscured by the paste and plaster that holds the mummy cases together. But researchers can see what is underneath by scanning them with different kinds of light which makes the inks glow.

The scan revealed a name - "Irethorru" - a common name in Egypt, the David or Stephen of its time, which meant: "the eye of Horus is against my enemies".

Until now, the only way to see what was written on them was to destroy these precious objects - leaving Egyptologists with a dilemma. Do they destroy them? Or do they leave them untouched, leaving the stories within them untold?

Now, researchers have developed a scanning technique that leaves the cases intact but allows historians to read what is on the papyrus. According to Dr Kathryn Piquette, of University College London, Egyptologists such as her now have the best of both worlds.

"I'm really horrified when we see these precious objects being destroyed to get to the text. It's a crime. They are finite resources and we now have a technology to both preserve those beautiful objects and also look inside them to understand the way Egyptians lived through their documentary evidence - and the things they wrote down and the things that were important to them."

Security forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo have killed at least seven people at a protest calling for President Joseph Kabila to step down, UN peacekepers say.

Police said three people had died and two of the deaths were being investigated.

Church activists and opposition parties had backed the demonstration.

Under a deal reached a year ago, Mr Kabila was due to step down by the end of 2017.

That was a year after the end of his second term in office. An election to replace him has now been delayed until December 2018.

Catholic activists had called for protests after Sunday church services, but the Congolese authorities banned the demonstration.

Police used live ammunition and tear gas to prevent protesters from gathering at locations including churches.

Two men were shot dead outside a church in the capital Kinshasa, rights group Human Rights Watch said.

UN spokeswoman Florence Marchal said that in addition to the seven people shot dead in Kinshasa, another protester had been killed in the central city of Kananga,

More than 120 people had been arrested, she said.

She condemned the "use of force against peaceful demonstrators" and the "violent suppression of fundamental rights and freedoms by security forces".

Mr Kabila has been in power since 2001. He was supposed to step down after his second and final term came to an end in 2016 but the vote to replace him was not held.

The failure to organise the polls led to a wave of deadly demonstrations by opposition supporters. The UN says dozens of people have been killed during anti-government protests over the past year.

A deal to create a transitional government brokered by the Catholic church collapsed because the government and the opposition were unable to agree on the power-sharing mechanism.Image copyright WHOI Image caption At the time of its loss, Nereus was investigating the Kermadec Trench

One of the world's most capable deep-sea research subs has been lost.

The robotic vehicle Nereus went missing while exploring one of the ocean's deepest spots: the Kermadec Trench, which lies north east of New Zealand.

Surface debris was found, suggesting the vessel suffered a catastrophic implosion as a result of the immense pressures where it was operating some 10km (6.2 miles) down.

Nereus was a flagship ocean explorer for the US science community.

"Nereus helped us explore places we've never seen before and ask questions we never thought to ask," said Timothy Shank, from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), which managed the sub's activities.

"It was a one-of-a-kind vehicle that even during its brief life brought us amazing insights into the unexplored deep ocean, addressing some of the most fundamental scientific problems of our time about life on Earth."

The $8m (£4.7m) robot was built in 2008 and could operate in an autonomous mode or remotely controlled via a tether to a support ship to explore the Earth's deepest oceanic trenches.

It used a lot of innovative technologies that allowed it to do things and go places that were off-limits to other research submersibles.

These technologies included rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, similar to those used in laptop computers, for extended power, and single-hair's-width fibre-optic cables - borrowed from torpedoes - for control and telemetry.

Leading British oceanographer Jonathan Copley, from the University of Southampton, said the loss of an underwater vehicle was an ever-present risk.

"To obtain some kinds of knowledge - particularly when physical samples are required for analysis - there is no alternative to sending equipment into the deep ocean, because the ocean's watery veil masks its depths from many forms of 'remote sensing'", he wrote on a University of Southampton blog this weekend.

"And although we have learned a lot from a century or so of largely 'blind sampling' by equipment such as trawls and seabed corers (which are still fine for answering some questions in some areas), we now often require more detailed sampling and surveying, using deep-sea vehicles, to answer further questions."

See More DetailsIn Poland, it's only a few hours until the end of the year, so it's an excellent chance to make a summary of things that happened to C++! As you might guess the whole year was dominated by the finalization and publication of C++17. Yet, there are some other "big" things that happened. Let's see the full report.

Previous reports: 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012.

Intro

As usual, at the end of the year, I try to gather essential events that happened in the C++ world.

Here are the main things for this year that got my attention:

C++17 and the stable progress of the standardization

Transparency of the Committee and compiler vendors

Community is growing!

More tools!

But read on to get all of the details :)

If you want to see predictions/expectations for 2018, read this post from Meeting C++ C++ in 2018.

Timeline

Just to have an overview:

Date Event February 2nd Intel C++ Compiler v18.0 February 27th - March 4th Kona, HI, USA - ISO C++ Meeting March 7th Visual Studio 2017 (v 15.0) released March 13th LLVM/Clang 4.0 Released March C++17 finalized and sent for ISO review April 25th - 29th ACCU 2017 May 2nd GCC 7.1 May 15th - 20th C++ Now 2017 July 10th - 15th Toronto, Canada - ISO C++ Meeting August 14th GCC 7.2 & Visual Studio 2017.3 September 6th C++17 formally approved by ISO and sent for publication September 7th LLVM/Clang 5.0.0 Released September 25th Bjarne Stroustrup awarded 2017 Faraday Medal September 23rd - October 1st CppCon 2017 November 9th - 11th Meeting C++ 2017 November 14th - 15th code::dive conference in Wroclaw, PL December 4th C++17 has been published as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 December 7th Visual Studio 2017 15.5 Released

C++11/14 compiler status

Before we dive into the newest stuff, let's recall what's the status of C++11 and C++14 implementation.

Just for the reference Clang (since 3.4 ), GCC (since 5.0) and Intel (version 15.0) already have full support for C++11/14.

Visual Studio with frequent releases of 2017 (Compiler version 15.5 and 15.6 currently) made significant progress towards implementing the missing parts: Expression SFINAE and Two-phase name lookup. It's not fully conformant, but very close to reach it. Read more in the VS section below.

So, all in all, we can say that C++11/14 is supported in all major compilers! So you have no excuses not to use modern C++ :)

C++17

The new standard was the main topic for the year.

In December it was published as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 Programming languages – C++. The standard was technically completed in March so at the beginning of the year we knew its full form.

You can also download a free version of the last draft: N4659, 2017-03-21, PDF.

Plus here are my bonus PDFs:

C++17 In Detail - 50-page PDF with description of all the features.

C++17 Reference Card - one-page reference card

A lot of opinions were expressed about the new standard. Some developers like it, some hoped for something more. Nevertheless, it's done now, and all we can do is to be happy and just start coding with the new techniques and utilities :)

And, as it appears, it's relatively easy to jump start into C++17, as most of the major compiler vendors implemented (or are very close) support for the new standard.

See below:

Compiler support for C++17

Full version, and up to date can be found @cppreference: C++17 compiler support , so here I'll focus on the most important parts:

The original table has confusing/wrong versions for Visual Studio, thanks to a comment from Stephan T. Lavavej I've corrected it using data from the recent VS compiler notes.

As you see most of the bigger features are there!

The problematic parts: parallel STL and filesystem are close to being available.

Intel offers their Parallel STL implementation, see: intel/parallelstl

and they offered it to libstdc++ - Intel offers Parallel STL implementation to GNU libstdc++ : cpp

and they offered it to libstdc++ - Intel offers Parallel STL implementation to GNU libstdc++ : cpp TS - for filesystem means that you have to use std::experimental namespace.

namespace. N/A for Intel - Intel does not ship with library implementation.

Visual Studio 2017.5 started to ship a few of parallel algorithms.

Visual Studio Versioning (from comment by Stephan T. Lavavej): The mapping is: 2015 (and all updates) was compiler 19.0, 2017 RTM was 19.10, 2017 15.3 was 19.11, 2017 15.5 is 19.12, and 2017 15.6 will be 19.13.

C++20

Unfortunately, there won't be C++18 (as I hoped in my April's post :)).

However, the committee has a stable progress towards C++20. Some features are already voted into the C++20 draft.

As revealed in the paper: Feb 2017 - P0592R0 - "To boldly suggest an overall plan for C++20". We can expect the following major features:

Modules

Ranges

Concepts

Networking

So that's the "master plan" and a guideline towards the new standard. Of course, it doesn't mean other things like Coroutines (in fact Coroutines were recently published as TS), contracts or your favourite future feature won't be approved.

The teams behind popular compilers make massive effort to stay up to date with the standard. In most of the newest versions (like GCC, Clang, VS) you can use most (or all) of C++17... but also a few C++20 features. For example, you can try concepts-lite in GCC; modules support in Clang or MSVC, or Coroutines. Not to mention Ranges.

From this point, it looks that C++20 will be a bit bigger than C++17. Still, it's important to remember that the Committee prepares a new standard every three years. So don't expect that they'll wait for the publication until all features are done (like we needed to wait 10+ years for C++11).

ISO C++ meetings

There were three committee meetings this year - in Kona, Toronto and Albuquerque.

Roughly at the beginning of the year, the committee closed work for C++17 and at the second and the third meeting they started voting features for C++20.

2017-02-27 to 03-04: Kona, HI, USA

During the meeting, C++17 was finalized and sent for the final ISO review.

The committee now shifts to prepare C++20; you can even read some plans here Feb 2017 - P0592R0 - "To boldly suggest an overall plan for C++20".

The plan is to have at least: modules, ranges, concepts and networking

Here are the trip reports:

2017-07-10 to 15: Toronto, Canada

The first meeting where Committee experts could vote changes into Draft C++20!

For example:

Concepts TS was merged into draft C++20

Add designated initializers. Draft C++20 now allows code like:

struct A { int x ; int y ; int z ; }; A b {. x = 1 , . z = 2 };

Trip reports:

2017-11-06 to 11: Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA;

A primary goal of the meeting was to address the comments received from national bodies in the Modules TS's comment ballot that ran this summer

Some new features added to C++20:

Trip reports

Compiler Notes

Current versions and most notable updates.

Visual Studio

Current version VS 2017 update 5 - 15.5.2 - Release notes - December 2017.

Microsoft team made 5 releases of VS 2017! (or 6 if we count RTM Release :))

Update: from Stephan T. Lavavej:

Only 3 were significant toolset updates, though (15.0, 15.3, 15.5; the other releases contained IDE updates and the occasional compiler bugfix).

With the recent version, you can even use some of the parallel algorithms. I did a quick experiment, and it seemed to work:

As you can see in the image above MSVC created a pool of threads, and each thread invoked my lambda. In V15.5 the following algorithms can be invoked in parallel: all_of , any_of , for_each , for_each_n , none_of , reduce , replace , replace_if , sort .

Here are some links to relevant blog posts from VC team. I like the transparency and that they share so much information with us.

GCC

August 14 - GCC 7.2, GCC 7 Release Series Changes

Clang

Current version: 5.0.1 - 21 Dec 2017, Release Notes

If you wonder why LLVM moved "slowly" with versions like 3.3, 3.4, 3.5... and now rapidly went from 4.0 to 5.0 here's the reason: the versioning scheme changed. Previously major version increased by adding "0.1", now it's done by adding "1.0".

Intel compiler

This is a brand new section in the summary.

While compilers do the primary job with our C++ code, we cannot forget about the importance of other tools.

Bear in mind that parsing C++ code is a tough task. Thanks to Clang developing tools is now significantly improved and streamlined.

Here are some notable tools that it's worth to know:

For Visual Studio: Clang Power Tools - Visual Studio Marketplace - image above.

IDE and Productivity

Code Analyzers

CppDepend v2017.3 - see all of the changes here - for the whole year.

version changes

PVS-Studio - a tool for bug detection in the source code of programs, written in C, C++, and C#. It works in Windows and Linux environment

Here's my blog post about using all of the information PVSStudio team shares: Learning from bugs and PVS-Studio Team How to use PVS-Studio for Free



Package managers

We probably won't see a standard package manager for C++ (as other languages sometimes provide), but there's good progress with such tools. Read this article/discussion for more information: Does C++ need a universal package manager? - by (Paul Fultz II).

Anyway recently I started using Conan, and it really works. Previously I had to download the components, install it, set proper links and paths in Visual Studio project. Now all I have to do is to provide an appropriate name of the library in conanfile.txt and run Conan to do all the work. The missing part: not huge list of available packages... but it's improving.

Visualizers

Sourcetrail (image above). Its objective is to assist with code exploration by creating dynamic graphs that show your project from a different perspective. See my review in this post - Better code understanding with Sourcetrail.

The tool is free for non-commercial use!

Also, Cpp Depend offers visualization options for projects: A picture is worth a thousand words: Visualize your C/C++ Projects – CppDepend Blog

Conferences

I am pleased to see that more and more C++ conferences are appearing. We have at least four strong points

CppCon

C++Now

Meeting C++

ACCU

But there are more: like Code::Dive, Italian CppCon or Pacific C++ - held for the first time this year!

Just in case here's the link to ISO C++ page with all registered conferences around the world: Conferences Worldwide, C++ FAQ.

CppCon 2017

Approaching 1200 attendees and 7 tracks

The opening keynote from Bjarne Stroustrup Learning and Teaching Modern C++

Near the same time Bjarne Stroustrup was awarded 2017 Faraday Medal. Congratulations!

And one of ITHare reports (more on his blog)

Meeting C++

Schedule.

This year Bjarne Stroustrup gave the opening keynote ("What C++ is and what it will become"). The closing keynote was presented by Louis Dionne ("C++ metaprogramming: evolution and future directions").

Meeting C++ 2016 Playlist

Code::Dive in Wroclaw, PL

November 14th & 15th, Code::Dive

code::dive is non-profit, annual conference for C++ enthusiasts

sponsored by NOKIA. The main idea behind the conference is to share the

knowledge beyond cutting edge technologies and build networking

between the people.

Mostly about C++ plus other languages like Rust, Go, Python.

This year I attended the conference and here's my trip report: code::dive 2017 conference report and Adi Shavit's code::dive Trip Report,

Community

Another strong point of the year: the community is growing! There are so many local C++ groups, slack channel, conferences, blogs, youtube channels... and we even have a podcast: CppCast.

Maybe it's my personal feeling - I usually track the changes and try to be active in the community - so I feel that growth and vibrancy. Still, I hope other developers can share the same opinion.

I am delighted that my city - Cracow - has now its C++ group! C++ User Group Krakow - join if you're near the city! :)

Thanks to Jens Weller for giving advice how to start such community, motivation to run them and hosting groups news at Meeting C++ site. See User Groups Worldwide or a news like C++ User Group Meetings in November 2017.

And congratulations for his 5th year of Meeting C++!

Jens also organized r/cpp_review - C++ Library Reviews:

My (Jens) motivation to start this is that with these reviews a community focused on quality in modern C++ could grow, where people are able to learn by example on various libraries. So while more experienced C++ users might be able to give better feedback on the overall design of a library

Please join the C++ Slack channel: https://cpplang.now.sh/

In terms of blogs I highly recommend the following:

And of course set isocpp.org - Standard C++ as your main homepage :)

You can also have a look at this r/cpp thread - Happy New Year r/cpp! and share your thoughts :)

Books

Some of the books released this year worth seeing:

I am still waiting for Large-Scale C++ Volume I, John Lakos, it finally should be ready in April 2018! At code::dive John Lakos mentioned that the draft is completed. So hopefully this date won't be shifted.

Summary

Wow, so many things happened!

Four things that I'd like to emphasize for the year:

C++17 and the stable progress of the standardization

Transparency of the Committee and compiler vendors

Community is growing!

More tools!

As I mentioned, in the beginning, the finalization of C++17 set the whole "theme" for the whole year. I like that the 3-year standardization process works and we can expect C++20 without delays. What's more, the compiler vendors have already implemented most of the C++17 features, so it's easy to apply new techniques to your projects. I also feel that "we're all" creating the new language not just "they". There are many groups or even r/cpp discussions where you can express your thoughts about the new things in the standard. I like such transparency.

There are of course downsides of frequent releases. A lot of C++ code is sometimes even not in C++11 version. A lot of us struggle with the maintenance of legacy code and learning modern standard is not an easy task. During the year I've heard an opinion that "real C++" (that we use in most of our projects) is so different than C++ presented in the newest standard. The gap is getting bigger, and bigger and developers might be frustrated (I expressed more thoughts on that topic in my post: How To Stay Sane with Modern C++).

But C++17 was only the part of events in 2017. The community is growing, list of conferences, number of active blogs (with valuable content)... and finally tools are working :) (and they become a crucial part of any development environment). It looks like being a C++ developer is getting more comfortable... a bit :)

So, all in all.... it was not a bad year... right? :)

Your turnLast week's "accidental" photo leak of potential FC Dallas transfer targets continues to pick up steam. Among those players, Colón defender Germán Conti, has been linked to FC Dallas by El Litoral.

El Litoral also states that FC Dallas is not alone in the 6'4 Argentinian defender, and that reigning MLS Cup winners, Toronto FC, are also in the hunt. But these two MLS sides are not the only ones chasing after Conti's signature as it's also reported that Brazilian side Atlético Mineiro has already made an initial offer, though 25% less than Colón's asking price.

What's most interesting about this report is that it's stated that Conti's exit clause is $3.6 million, which would put him as the most expensive transfer in club history.

Conti would certainly be a very interesting pick up for Dallas. At 23, Conti presents himself as an up and coming defender with a high ceiling. Should Dallas secure his services, it wouldn't surprise me to see him sold to Europe in 3-4 years at much higher price.

As of December 31, 2017 Dallas still only has two centerbacks on the roster, so the club is in need of bodies. Conti's combination of age, athleticism and upside is certainly the type of player that Oscar Pareja loves to develop. Plus, the ruthlessness of fellow Argentinians Mauro Diaz and Maximiliano Urruti were nowhere near their peak once their trio went down to two after Mauro Rosales left the club.

Here's a YouTube highlight clip of Conti's abilities. Obviously this is very difficult to judge anyone based on clips like this, but he certainly does move and defend a lot like Matt Hedges, does he not?

A few years ago, I would've scoffed at the idea of Dallas spending $3.6 million on a defender. But after last season's collapse and the window to capitalize on this team's potential, it won't surprise me if the club started investing heavily in securing younger more expensive talents.Ludwigshafen – Mit einem 20 Zentimeter langen Küchenmesser stach er in einem Drogeriemarkt in Kandel (Rheinland-Pfalz) immer wieder auf seine Ex-Freundin Mia (†15) ein, ließ sich danach von Kunden des Ladens festhalten, bis die Polizei kam ...

DIE BLUTTAT IN DER DROGERIE

Der Killer ist der Afghane Abdul D. (15). Er kam im April 2016 als unbegleiteter minderjähriger Flüchtling illegal nach Deutschland, ist derzeit Asylbewerber. Derzeit wird geprüft, ob er tatsächlich 15 Jahre alt ist.

Mit dem Mädchen soll er den Ermittlern zufolge eine Beziehung geführt haben, die über mehrere Monate gegangen sei. Anfang Dezember kam es dann zur Trennung: Mia wollte offenbar nicht mehr mit Abdul D. zusammen sein.

Mias Eltern erstatteten Anzeige

Die Eltern des Opfers hatten Abdul D. Mitte Dezember 2017 wegen Beleidigung, Nötigung und Bedrohung angezeigt.

► Nach Darstellung der Polizei soll er ihre Tochter nach Ende der Beziehung über soziale Netzwerke und telefonisch immer wieder belästigt haben. Auch habe er gedroht, er wolle Mia "abpassen".

Die Polizei machte am 17. Dezember eine Gefährderansprache. Einen Tag später gab es ein Gespräch mit dem 15-Jährigen in der Schule. Das sei standardmäßiges Vorgehen in einem solchen Fall, so die Ermittler.

Der Fall Afghane tötet Ex-Freundin Eltern des Mädchens zeigten ihn schon vor zwei Wochen an Der Täter befindet sich seit Frühjahr 2016 als unbegleiteter Flüchtling in Deutschland. Er stach mehrfach mit einem Küchenmesser zu.

Rheinland-Pfalz Afghane (15) ersticht Mädchen in Drogeriemarkt Dem Angriff ging ein Streit zwischen den Teenagern voraus. Passanten überwältigten den jungen Afghanen nach der Tat.

Noch am Vormittag des Tattags hatten Polizisten dem Jugendlichen eine Vorladung wegen der Strafanzeige persönlich ausgehändigt.

Faustschläge auf dem Schulhof

Foto: info.BILD.de

Polizeilich erfasst war Killer Abdul D. nicht nur wegen seiner illegalen Einreise – sondern auch wegen Körperverletzung bei einer Schlägerei auf einem Schulhof im November 2017.

Laut Ermittlern war er mit einem Jugendlichen in Streit geraten, Beleidigungen wurden ausgesprochen.

Dann soll Abdul D. seinen Widersacher mit Faustschlägen verletzt haben.

Von Mai 2016 bis September 2017 war Abdul D. im Kreis Germersheim in einer Jugendhilfeeinrichtung untergebracht gewesen, danach wurde er nach Neustadt an der Weinstraße verlegt (circa 30 Kilometer von Kandel entfernt). Dort lebte er in einer betreuten Jugendwohngruppe.

Gegen Abdul D. erging Haftbefehl wegen Totschlags, er sitzt in Untersuchungshaft.

Die Ermittler wollen auch prüfen, ob Mord als Vorwurf infrage kommt. Für das Strafmaß macht dies keinen Unterschied. Die Höchststrafe liegt in beiden Fällen im Jugendstrafrecht bei zehn Jahren.

Abdul D. hat sich laut Staatsanwaltschaft bislang nicht zu der Tat geäußert.

It is illustrative of journalistic priorities in a media environment taut with partisan tension, when every editorial choice is frustrated by the knowledge that it may wind up as a defense of political adversaries or an indictment of traditional allies.

A historic moment, however, demands that reporters and editors put aside their partisan differences and let the moral gravity of an event draw into clear focus where the political fault lines actually lie. It is neither a Republican nor a Democratic issue when millions of people yearning to breathe free strike the iron that can emancipate them from their shackles.

It is inconsequential to the broader plight of humanity whether a despised president or a beloved one has pronounced an official position that has ossified into a party line.

It is time for journalists to rise above the shopworn fray and take up the mantle of another people's freedom. There are lives on the line; not merely the corporeal heartbeats that drive these people ever on under brutally oppressive conditions, but the lives that may have been, should they have been afforded the basic human dignity to pursue their own dreams.

While standard bearers of the U.S. media like the Washington Post arrogantly proclaim "Democracy Dies in Darkness," an affront against the faux-dictatorship of President Trump that smacks even more risible in relief to the Iranian mullahs, here is the front page as of this early afternoon.

Protests for Democracy Die in Darkness #Iranprotests pic.twitter.com/4qKhsXZIcd — Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) December 30, 2017

The Iranian protests, which have killed at least three and have led to hundreds of protesters jailed in the past 48 hours, were not simply invisible in comparison to other less historic news, but were conflated with "pro-government" protests on CNN.

"Crowds of pro-government supporters demonstrated Saturday in Iran after two days of rare anti-government protests which spread to a number of cities," CNN reported.

"Nearly 2,000 people gathered peacefully in the capital, Tehran, in support of the government's policies, an eyewitness there said. State-run Iranian broadcasters showed demonstrators waving the Iranian flag at the pro-government rally, which had been scheduled before the anti-government protests broke out. Meanwhile, coverage of the anti-government protests was very limited on state-run media, which referenced them only in passing," it continued.

The critique of the news outlet's false equivalency between protests demanding freedom and justice and staged counter-protests from the corrupt dictatorial Iranian regime was pointed.

"Largest anti-govt protests since 2009 and they don't even get discussed till paragraph 4," one commenter tweeted. "Do you think we don't know how news stories are written? Do you think we don't know the 'important' stuff goes first? Your network is an embarrassment and so are you."

The notion that such protests in Iran are "rare" was propagated by both CNN and Reuters. It projects the false notion that Iran is a sea of domestic tranquility and the protesters are relative malcontents. This belies the fact that Iranian activists have been protesting the regime since the 1979 revolution, including the 2009 uprising that ended in bloody suppression.

Meanwhile, this is the reality of the protests on the streets that is not being shown on CNN and other news outlets.

While former President Obama famously was silent for ten days following the crushed 2009 Green Movement, and remains quiet to this day about expressing support for pro-democratic forces in Iran, current President Trump vocally supported the activists.

Many reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with regime's corruption & its squandering of the nation's wealth to fund terrorism abroad. Iranian govt should respect their people's rights, including right to express themselves. The world is watching! #IranProtests — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2017

It is this political fault line that may explain the U.S. media's reticence to give anything but restrained, obligatory coverage of the protests.

"Just look at what Iran Deal did to Dems," said Omri Ceren. "They've become so invested in Iran regime's survival – because regime is guarantor of the deal – can't even offer full-throated support to protesters demanding freedom and facing down govt thugs. Make up excuses about not getting involved."

Ceren also pointed out that the New York Times recently reported that Trump supporters in Iran were pro-government, a claim that appears exceedingly dubious, especially in hindsight.

"Massive anti-govt protests in Iran broke out exactly a month after this NYT A1 article was published saying Trump's foreign policy had united Iranians as pro-govt," he wrote on Twitter.

"Why does @ brianstelter hate Iranians who seek freedom? Is it because they are opposing Obama's mullah pals?" conservative pundit Kurt Schlichter put it more pointedly.

"It is amazing to watch CNN deliberately burn its credibility and ratings to the ground, all to protect James Clapper and Ben Rhodes," The Federalist's Sean Davis remarked.

As the Iranians take to the streets in the biggest protest since the suppressed 2009 Green Movement, it's remarkable how little the U.S. media seem to care. Even as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps., at the behest of its leader Ali Khameini, murders peaceful protesters in the streets and jails political dissidents, today's mainstream journalist shrugs.

The news media outlets that care enough to editorialize on the protests merely twist them to represent a revolt against the "high cost of living"; obviously, there is an economic component that provides pressure on the situation, such as the dropping price of oil in conjunction with escalating U.S. production.

But to chalk things up as simple discontent over subpar government welfare in a tough economic environment is simplistic and dangerously misleading. It is also suspiciously conducive to the socialist one-size-fits-all solution of government welfare as the elixir for all of society's ills.

Conveniently lost in the smokescreen narrative is that millions of Iranians are dying, some of them literally, to regain their freedom after a brutal Islamist regime took over their nation in 1979. Once again, a historic moment to take power back for the people has arrived; once again, the U.S. media are letting them down.

What else can Americans expect from a press corps. that refuses to condemn human rights violators like Cuba and Venezuela if it's found to be politically inconvenient? As for the silence of its voice as wanton violence and injustice is perpetrated against innocent people, one can only assume its reserved power for change stands idly by in quiet solidarity with the oppressors.How Facebook will infiltrate national elections and rule the world in less than 10 years — unless we stop it

Published to launch the new beta platform for INSURGE intelligence, a crowdfunded journalism platform for Open Inquiry and coordinated action in service of people and planet. Become an owner of the media revolution.

Imagine a world in which everybody gave away their freedom, willingly, in return for being able to belong to a toxic network which, rather than enriching their lives, profited from eroding civil discourse, polarizing communities, and manipulating their minds.

Wouldn't you wonder what was wrong with these people?

You would. And yet that is the world you are about to inhabit, right now. Unless you do something about it.

This story is a call to action. A call on citizens, technologists, philanthropists, journalists and beyond to take action to disrupt our current path to a dystopian, monocultural future. As such, it experiments with a new form of journalistic narrative called Open Inquiry, that aims to balance out the investigation of power with a recognition of solutions and alternatives.

Facebook is on track to become more powerful than the National Security Agency — so says a senior advisor to the US military intelligence community who predicted the rise of artificial intelligence and robot warfare. In less than a decade, Facebook's growth will mean it potentially has the ability to monitor almost everyone on the planet. This will make the firm more powerful than any other government contractor in the world.

This prospect has dangerous ramifications for democracy. Increasing evidence reveals that Facebook's most lucrative business model is to outsource itself as a conduit for psychological warfare to any third party that wants to influence the beliefs and behaviors of citizens.

Key portions of this story have remained untold, until now. You've heard the story of Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook profiling to influence election campaigns on both sides of the Atlantic. You've heard how Russia has curious ties to some of these players, even as it too has gamed Facebook in its efforts to fight 'hybrid war'.

All of which suggests an extreme right-wing cabal has used Big Data to hijack US, British and European democratic processes.

But this is not the whole story. INSURGE intelligence navigates a web of connections between Cambridge Analytica's directors, senior employees and associated companies, throwing new light on how the firm's modus operandi has been developed in the most classified bowels of the British government's national security system.

We reveal for the first time the firm's sweeping interlinkages with powerful Anglo-American political and economic interests; the NATO national security complex; military intelligence agencies; private military contractors accused of illegal activity and incompetence; the global fossil fuel industry; and a pro-Tory British financial oligarchy with massive investments in British and Russian property markets. Rather than representing a grand conspiracy, these interlocking networks grant us a window into the structural alignment of power in which they operate.

Cambridge Analytica's UK umbrella company, SCL Group, is a former UK Ministry of Defense contractor which held access to classified information. Our investigation reveals that the firm continues to have symbiotic ties with the British Foreign Office, which officially wants to exploit the firm's success in assisting the Trump campaign for UK foreign policy goals.

Mark Turnbull, who heads up SCL Elections, the subsidiary company responsible for the firm's elections work, is a former Bell Pottinger consultant who oversaw Pentagon influence operations in Iraq, one of which produced fake al-Qaeda videos.

The same Turnbull had founded Aethos, the 'strategic communications' division of Aegis Defense Services, the giant UK military contractor bought up by the even bigger Canadian corporation, GardaWorld. Together, these firms have generated significant controversy over their treatment of civilians in Iraq, recruitment of child soldiers in Sierra Leone, and 'tactical incompetence' in Afghanistan, to name just a few issues.

SCL Group's directors hold direct business interests in a range of companies involved in two prominent sectors: the arms and defense trade; and the global oil and gas industry. The key mover-and-shaker here is Julian Wheatland, Chairman of SCL Group, who is a director of Hatton International, an obscure company that specializes in defense offset services to private arms and aerospace firms; and a former director of a Hatton-associated company, Phi Energy Group, which worked with some of the world's leading oil majors.

Other SCL Group directors have business partnerships with powerful pro-Tory financial interests, some with ties to the Brexit campaign. Chief among them is Hanson Asset Management, the legacy of the late Thatcherite business tycoon, Lord Hanson. Patrick Teroerde, a co-founding director of Hanson Asset Management, was an early director — seemingly a co-founding director — of subsidiary company SCL Elections, which reportedly assisted Vote Leave. Lord Hanson's surrogate at his anti-EU 'Business in Sterling' group, Dominic Cummings, was Vote Leave's campaign director.

Another SCL Group director, Roger Gabb, shares a property investment company with a number of British property tycoons, including billionaire Anton Bilton and Bimaljit Singh Sandhu, both of whom are invested heavily in UK and Russian property markets through the firm, Raven Russia — which explicitly articulates an interest in opening up Russia to foreign investors. Raven Russia denies knowing Gabb or anything about SCL Group.

SCL Group has not only gamed Facebook to assist the election of Donald Trump and, it seems, the Brexit campaign; but also received $1 million (CAD) to support NATO influence operations in Eastern Europe and the Ukraine, targeting Russia.

And while the firm no longer has contracts with the MoD, it has picked up several State Department contracts for global influence operations, is pursuing numerous others across the US federal government, and maintains close ties with the British Foreign Office.

In early 2017, the FCO convened a closed conference on how the government could best utilize Big Data for its foreign policy goals, inviting Turnbull and his lead data scientist to speak about Cambridge Analytica's work assisting the Trump campaign. The FCO refused to clarify how the gaming of Facebook to influence the American vote was relevant to the British government's diplomatic agenda abroad.This is the Top 10 Bleeding Cool Bestseller List, as compiled by a number of comic stores from their sales on Wednesday and Thursday. It measures what are known as the "Wednesday Warriors", those who can't wait to the weekend to get this week's comics. We salute you, and the keenness you bring to your passion.

And every single reporting store had Doomsday Clock #2 by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank as their number one.Across the board, with almost all followingup with the Metal-spinoff Hawkman Found. Phoenix Resurrection lagged behind....

Doomsday Clock #2 Hawkman Found #1 Phoenix Resurrection #1 Amazing Spider-Man #793 Detective Comics #971 Action Comics #994 Teen Titans #15 Flash #37 Wonder Woman #37 Thanos #14

Thanks to the following retailers,

And this is what they have to say,

Doomsday Clock dominated again, with both covers outselling (individually even) everything else – though HAWKMAN FOUND would have ranked higher had we ordered more. Wish we had seen the METAL cover design/beforehand – would have ordered more.

—–

Doomsday Clock blew the competition away. Especially that beautiful Lex Luthor cover. Phoenix Resurrection and Amazing Spider-Man topped the sales for Marvel this week.

—–

While DC won for the week with the top 3 slots, Marvel managed to tie them with 5 books placing on the list. There's measurable excitement growing for Donny Cates' work on THANOS, and Moon Knight managed to sneak in as well. That said, DOOMSDAY CLOCK sold more than 2nd through 5th place combined– the dominant force and payer of our bills this week.

——

Big week for books, ok week for sales. Even BigTwo split. On the bottom half of the list Teen Titans falls slightly to below Action, Iron Man, and X-Men: Blue with a surprise of Deadpool making the list at #10. Never thought I'd see a Hawkman book as the second best seller of the week yet here we are. As with nearly all Metal tie-ins our store did not order enough and sold out on Wednesday. Phoenix did well enough to make it to #5 on the list but with numbers far lower than the rest of the upper five. Spider-Man is doing well again at #3 for the week but nothing could touch a sequel to some 80's book.

——

Marvel had 6 spots on my top ten this week. Amazing. Hawkman Found came in at number 3. Hawkman has never charted so high in my store, ever. Doomsday Clock was number 1 by a mile, of course. I'm looking forward to next week when all our regulars are back in town. Happy New Year.

——

Doomsday Clock takes the top spot at FFF, outselling every other book on the shelf by at least 20 copies. Hawkman Found was our second best seller followed by Detective Comics. Phoenix Resurrection was the first Marvel book in our Top Ten with a pretty solid first week. Hopefully people stay interested in a weekly $4 book enough to keep sales strong. Amazing Spider-Man actually managed to sneak into the #10 spot to keep Phoenix company. Metal #4 made it to #8 on it's second week.

For our Top Twenty, Doomsday Clock continues to sell well, outselling most new books from the week. Thanos fell just outside the Top Ten selling one less copy than Amazing Spider-Man. Batman Creature of the Knight definitely fell off a bit, which is shame for such a good mini, but with all the other Bat-centric books coming out right now it definitely suffers from a lack of publicity.

Redneck and Outcast were the only indie books to make it into the Top Twenty. Both come from big names with solid fanbases so it's no surprise to see them sell. It is a little shocking to see that Redneck actually hasn't sold more this week. But we definitely don't push it as hard as we do Babyteeth.

—–

DC secured the number one and two spots in the final week of the year with a one-two punch of smash hit event comics: DOOMSDAY CLOCK #2 and Metal tie-in HAWKMAN FOUND #1. Marvel didn't slack off, though, and their lenticular-covered PHOENIX RESURRECTION #1 came in at a strong third place.

DC staples ACTION COMICS and DETECTIVE COMICS round off the top half of the list, while everyone's favorite neighborhood arachnid is crawling all over the bottom half: AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #793, SPIDER-MEN II #5, and AMAZING SPIDER-MAN RENEW YOUR VOWS #14 all made our top 10.

—–

Doomsday Clock dominated once again this week, selling nearly double the next bestselling comic, Phoenix Resurrection. That's not to say that The Return of Jean Grey #1 wasn't a good draw; it just wasn't enough to take on Doomsday Clock. However, it's worth noting that if this list weren't made up of just issues, Saga Volume 8 would've been our runner-up this week.

—–

DC sweeps all ten spots in our store this week, with Marvel missing by two copies as Amazing Spider-Man #793 barely lost out to Justice League of America for 10th place. The drop-off on Star Wars titles is almost startling–a major Star Wars film is in theatres right now, and our numbers on most Star Wars books have fallen by 15%.Updates and information about Bare Oaks Family Naturist Park as well as general topics about naturism.

A wind chill advisory is in effect for the area from 8 p.m. Sunday night through noon on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. The NWS reported that locals should expect wind chills to range from 5 below zero to 20 below zero.

A reinforcing shot of arctic air moves in today with the coldest temps tonight into New Years Day. Wind chill advisories and warnings in effect. Wind chills likely remaining below zero all day Mon. pic.twitter.com/rDxAwrYjpq — NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) December 31, 2017

Considering the intense cold and "by the recommendation of public safety," organizers of 2018 Boston First Night have amended the event schedule. Sunday's Frog Pond Skating Spectacular and People's Procession to Boston Common, both slated for 6 p.m., are canceled. Boston's Family Fireworks, meant to take place at 7 p.m., have also been canceled, as have the Copley Square Stage Performances, on the docket for New Year's Day from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

For all other events, including the midnight fireworks display and Enchanted Forest ice sculpture presentation, organizers urge caution and ask that attendees dress warmly.

The NWS warns that these cold wind chills can cause frostbite to exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes, and recommends heading inside often to warm up.

Mayor Marty Walsh also asked residents to be careful if they decide to partake in the festivities.

"First Night is a great Boston tradition that many families look forward to each year. This year, New Year's Eve is going to be extremely cold, so we're asking residents to use their best judgment if they choose to be outside for any duration of time," Walsh said in a statement. "I urge residents to look out for another and remain vigilant as we experience some of the coldest weather our city has seen in years, so that together we can ring in 2018 safely."The Duke of Edinburgh pointed out a bearded man and asked "is that a terrorist?" as he greeted crowds at Sandringham, it has been claimed.

The 96-year-old husband to Queen Elizabeth was attending St Magdalene Church on New Year's Eve, when it is reported he made the comment as he joked with onlookers.

Witnesses who claimed to have heard the comment said the man had a ginger beard, The Sun and the Mail Online reported.

The Duke traditionally marks the festive period with the Queen at her Sandringham estate in Norfolk in England, attending a church service on Christmas morning and New Year's Eve with the royal family.

Philip, who retired in August, is notorious for making controversial comments.

He once famously asked a group of Aboriginal Australians during a visit in 2002: "Do you still throw spears at each other?"

He also once asked a disabled 60-year-old man on a mobility scooter: "How many people have you knocked over this morning on that thing?"

Buckingham Palace declined to comment."The National Review crowd can't admit they were wrong, dead wrong, about Donald Trump," said Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government.

Manning made his comments during Friday's edition of SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight with Breitbart Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour.

"[Donald Trump] is the most conservative president in my lifetime, and I include Ronald Reagan," opined Manning, reflecting on National Review's ongoing framing of the 45th president as lacking conservative bona fides.

National Review's 2016 "Against Trump" article derided then presidential candidate Donald Trump as a "philosophically unmoored political opportunist who would trash the broad conservative ideological consensus."

Manning reflected on National Review's expressed contempt for "white working class" communities, recalling the magazine's 2016 cover story by Kevin Williamson which described predominantly white and rural communities as "dysfunctional and downscale."



"White working class" communities "deserve to die," wrote National Review's Williamson in that 2016 cover article about then-candidate Trump's voters. When confronted by criticism for this stance, the magazine doubled down.

Manning said Williamson was "dead wrong" that we should "let rural America die."

"Rural America is being murdered," explained Manning. "They weren't dying, they were being murdered by trade laws that sent out jobs overseas, by tax laws that made it too expensive to build stuff here, and by environmental laws that strangle the life out of anybody who wants to grow anything, extract anything, or build anything."

"And that's why Kevin Williamson was dead wrong in his arrogance in believing that free trade was everything, when in fact what's really important is having trade based on a level playing field," said Manning. "America tied both hands behind her back in a boxing match trying to use our forehead to fight with. We'll never be able to win that boxing match. Donald Trump's changed the game."

Mansour said she is "still appalled" by that Williamson National Review article.

"They were trying to write off these working class communities in the Rust Belt and these rural communities throughout America," said Mansour. "And yet, this was the same National Review that shilled endlessly for the Bush administration's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and you know what? The sons and daughters of the very same people in these communities that National Review is telling us, 'Oh, just let 'em die off' — those were the ones that went and fought the wars that National Review was shilling for. Those were the ones that bled in those wars. Those were the ones that came home injured from those wars, and National Review has the gall to then say, 'Oh, your community should be allowed to die. You're just lazy. You're indefensible.'"

"It was the most appalling piece I had ever read," said Manning of Williamson's National Review cover article.

America's decades-long hemorrhaging of manufacturing jobs, said Manning, was not an inevitable phenomenon, but a function of irresponsible trade policies. Trump, he added, was working toward enacting changes to make America's economic landscape more hospitable to manufacturing enterprises.

President Donald Trump is increasing American global economic competitiveness, said Manning, with specific aim at China.

"He is creating an environment where America will have a chance to regain all the momentum of an economy that they had when I was a kid in the 1960s and 1970s," said Manning. "We were the dominant economy in the world. We're going to able to compete with the Chinese."

"We're going to compete," Manning explained. "We're going to fight for our market. We're not just going to roll over on our backs and say, 'Oh, it's a new normal, and turn the world over to the Chinese.' Donald Trump is getting rid of the obstacles that block those opportunities to expand our own individual lives. I'm just overwhelmed with joy, right now, that we have a world now where America will compete, and our people will be able to compete, as opposed to being shut out because their own government refuses to fight for them."

Mansour concurred with Manning's description of Trump's conservatism.

"It looks as if after one year in office we can definitely say that Donald Trump is governing as a conservative," said Mansour. "Everything that 'Against Trump' magazine cover article told us — that Trump is not really a conservative, that he's a Democrat in sheep's clothing — they were one hundred percent wrong. He's a conservative. He's actually done certain things that even the other so-called conservatives on the stage during the primary — the sixteen other guys — some of them wouldn't have done."

"Ivy league prigs" among the ostensibly conservative commentariat, said Manning, were myopic in their utilitarian and economic political analyses: "Ivy League prigs who sit there with their little theories not caring who gets harmed, hoping that they'll be able to get a big screen TV for ten dollars less than they would've otherwise, in order to trade the jobs overseas. That's got to end, and Donald Trump's ending it, and that's what's important. That's his victory."

The most important metric of presidential success, said Manning, a president's impact on social attitudes. Trump is succeeding in this dimension, he said: "Here's the measurement by which I measure a president. Has he changed the culture? Has he changed the mindset, has he changed the belief in the country about where we're going to go and the hope for the future? This president has."

National Review markets itself as a "conservative" news media outlet.

Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.A woman who requested a female nurse for an intimate procedure was given an "obviously male" member of staff with stubble and tattoos, who claimed to be a transsexual.

The National Health Service (NHS) patient said she was "embarrassed and distressed" when summoned by a nurse with "an obviously male appearance ... close-cropped hair, a male facial appearance and voice, large number of tattoos and facial stubble" to carry out a cervical smear, The Times reports.

When she pointed out what she thought was a mistake, the nurse told her off: "My gender is not male. I'm a transsexual."

Speaking after the examination, which she ultimately decided to abandon, the patient said it was "weird where somebody says to you: 'My gender is not male' and you think: 'Well, what does that even mean? You are clearly a man.' "

In a formal letter of complaint, she objected that "People who are not comfortable about this are presented as bigots and this is ... kind of how I was made to feel about it."

The incident raises concerns about the governing Tory Party's proposed Gender Recognition Act, spearheaded by lesbian Education Secretary Justine Greening, which seeks to "de-medicalise" the gender transition process and allow men to legally change gender with a simple self-declaration.

Greening has described the change as necessary to "[tackle] some of the historic prejudices that still persist in our laws and giving LGBT people a real say on the issues affecting them", but critics have said it could allow biological males easy access to women's lavatories, changing areas, and even refuges without a medical professional having ever diagnosed them with genuine gender dysphoria.

The Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, which manages the clinic where this particular incident took place, conceded that its nurse had self-identified as a woman, but that they had not been employed on that basis.

"We apologised to this patient for the recording error and because the staff member accepted they didn't manage the situation appropriately; the patient needed to feel listened to. Trust policy is to consider seriously all requests for clinicians of a particular gender," the trust said in a statement.

The patient is fortunate to have received an apology, as police guidance could easily have allowed the trust to report her complain as an anti-trans "hate crime", or at least a "non-crime hate incident".

Follow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomeryMigrants from countries like Eritrea, Cameroon, and Mexico have flooded the U.S. southern border in San Diego to such an extent in recent days that U.S. border officials have been unable to process them without long lines forming on the Tijuana side of the border.

Nearly 100 migrants lined up in a plaza on the Mexico side of the border that leads to the San Ysidro pedestrian border crossing in San Diego last week because of the backlog, according to the San Diego Union Tribune. Mexican officials told those who tried to sleep in the plaza that they had to leave. Eritrean migrants cited in the article claimed that last Monday 25 migrants were temporarily jailed for waiting in the plaza.

One of the Eritrean migrants told the Tribune that he felt racism, "big discrimination," and no respect in Mexico.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials are working to process the foreign nationals that arrive at the border and are working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to one who spoke with the Tribune. It takes time to process each individual and move them from holding cells to detention.

As the report details, migrants who claim fear of returning to their country are transferred to other immigration officials for consideration of potential asylum cases. An excess of these cases can back up the space available to process more individuals.

In just the month of October 2017 CBP Border Patrol San Diego border sector reported apprehension of individuals from Bangladesh (12), Brazil (1), Camaroon (3), Chad (1), China (16), El Salvador (76), Eritrea (7), Gambia (4), Guatemala (178), Honduras (54), India (101), Iran (1), Mexico (1,877), Nepal (31), Nicaragua (1), Pakistan (13), Peru (1), Somalia (1), and "Unknown" (1) — a total of 2,379 individuals. These numbers are similar to volumes seen in this sector for October since 2012.

Many migrants gave up at San Isidro, according to the Tribune, and moved on to try other ports of entry in Mexicali or Texas.

Follow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomeryAn illegal alien from China convicted of killing her five-year-old daughter got sentenced to 22 years in prison Friday.

Mingming Chen, 30, received her sentence after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter, tampering with evidence, corpse abuse, child endangerment, and obstruction of justice, the Daily Mail reported.

Authorities found Chen's daughter, Ashley Zhao, 5, dead in her family's North Canton, Ohio, restaurant after she had been reported missing in January.

Authorities conducted a state-wide manhunt in search of Ashley after she had been reported missing. They found her body the next day inside the restaurant by the freezer.

Both Chen and her husband, Liang Zhao, were arrested following the gruesome discovery.

Authorities say Chen hit the girl several times, causing fatal brain injuries, and that her husband attempted to revive her. However, he allegedly helped hide his daughter's body when he realized that his attempts to revive her were futile.

County Prosecutor John Ferrero said Chen did not plan to kill her daughter, and that she "committed" the crime "in a fit of anger by a mother who had never bonded with her child."

Defense attorney Richard Drucker argued that Chen was sorry for what she did and takes full responsibility for her actions. Drucker added that he would have argued Zhao also bore responsibility for his daughter's death if the case had gone to trial.

Zhao pleaded guilty to charges of obstruction of justice and corpse abuse. He agreed to testify against his wife as part of his plea deal.

Authorities say Chen will be deported to China after she serves her time behind bars because she had been in the U.S. illegally.

Other non-U.S. citizens who have been convicted of crimes are also facing deportation upon completion of their sentences. A Ghanian national who had been convicted of food stamp fraud may face deportation after she completes her prison sentence.Even President Donald Trump's critics cannot deny his historic success in 2017 in appointed judges to the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, exercising one of the greatest powers of the presidency in a way that will create a lasting legacy shaping the destiny of the nation.

President Trump's clearest single victory on the judicial front was the successful nomination and confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court. It began with the unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016. For voters, the issue of the courts went from the abstract to the concrete, and judicial appointments became a red-hot issue.

Once candidate Trump locked up the GOP nomination, in May 2016 he released a list of potential Supreme Court picks. The list was a conservative goldmine. Shortly before the election, he expanded it to 21—including Gorsuch, a judge from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit—and pledged to pick only a judge from that list for Scalia's seat.

Polls show that the Supreme Court was the #1 issue for a whopping 21 percent of voters on Election Day 2016, and that those voters broke for Trump by a huge margin of 57-40. The courts were one of his most potent political issues going into the ballot box.

President Trump nominated Gorsuch on January 31 to great fanfare. The 49-year-old was confirmed in April, and by the end of the Supreme Court's annual term in June 2017 his initial actions evidenced that he is a rock-ribbed originalist, as the president had promised the voters.

But President Trump's success did not end with Gorsuch. That was only the beginning. He began nominating dozens of federal judges to fill 167 current or imminent vacancies, and pushing them through the Senate.

Article II of the Constitution specifies that only the president can nominate a federal judge, subject to confirmation by the U.S. Senate. Once confirmed, those judges usually serve for life. Some of the judges this president appoints during his tenure could still be serving on the bench 40 years from now.

On December 14, President Trump made history when the Senate confirmed his nomination of Judge James Ho to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, becoming the first president to successfully appoint 12 federal appeals court judges in the first year of a presidency.

These appellate judges were confirmed almost on party-line votes, however. Ho was confirmed by a vote of 53-43. This came on the heels of Judge Amy Coney Barrett's being confirmed to the Seventh Circuit 55-43, Judge Joan Larsen's being confirmed to the Sixth Circuit 60-38, and Allison Eid's being confirmed to the Tenth Circuit 56-41.

Two of these judges (Ho and Eid) clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas, and the other two (Barrett and Larsen) clerked for Scalia. All went on to extremely impressive careers in the law afterward. Ho is of Chinese dissent, immigrating from Taiwan as a child with his parents before he could speak English. The others are women.

Yet for all this, they were confirmed without more than a handful of Democratic votes. The party that claims to be for racial and gender diversity voted against judges they admitted were extremely well-qualified when those judges were openly conservative.

President Trump's appointments suggest that a White House can have a principled merits-based selection process devoid of racial and gender preferences that will still yield diverse results—including diversity of thought.

The president's record numbers were achieved despite literally unprecedented obstruction for judicial nominees. In 1986, Scalia had a mile-long paper trail as an uncompromising conservative, first as a top legal official in Republican administrations, then as a law professor, and finally as a federal appeals judge. Yet the Senate confirmed him 98-0 to the Supreme Court, with every Democratic senator acknowledging that President Ronald Reagan had the constitutional right to pick conservative judges.

By 2006, most Democrats voted against the clearly well-qualified Justice Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court, with a final tally in the Republican Senate of 58-42. Yet that same year, the Senate unanimously confirmed Gorsuch to the Tenth Circuit, just as they unanimously had confirmed Scalia to the Supreme Court 20 years earlier.

Yet in 2017—when Gorsuch had established a consensus-building record as a judge, being part of unanimous decisions at the Tenth Circuit 97 percent of the time, and part of the majority 99 percent of the time—Democrats tried to filibuster his nomination to the Supreme Court. That filibuster was broken only by a change to Senate rules—the "nuclear option"—in a 52-48 vote. Democratic senators who openly admitted that he was fully qualified for the Supreme Court voted against him nonetheless. Gorsuch was confirmed by a vote of only 54-45.

Senate confirmations for well-qualified nominees have degenerated from unanimous for all courts (including Supreme Court), to unanimous for lower courts but party-line at Supreme Court, to party-line votes at the court of appeals. For two centuries, no president before President Trump had to combat such hyper-partisan obstruction.

Both parties see the stakes. President Trump has made 68 nominations so far to the 167 current or upcoming vacancies on the federal bench, with dozens more nominees expected in early 2018. At year's end, 19 of those nominees have been confirmed, with many more pending on the Senate floor for a final vote.

Yet there are still impediments that President Trump and Senate Republicans must push through. Of the 19 judges who have been confirmed, Senate Democrats required a cloture vote for 18 of them. By contrast, there was only a single cloture vote on judicial nominations during the hundreds of judicial confirmations over eight years of the Obama presidency.

Even after cloture is invoked, Senate rules allow for up to 30 hours additional debate. Each of these confirmations has been costly, yet the president and his allies have persisted.

President Trump has done three things that have proven instrumental to his historic judicial victories.

First, President Trump has picked the right two top-level members of his administration to make all this happen.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been a leading national authority on the courts throughout his years in the Senate and advising the Trump campaign. In addition to the many successes Sessions has delivered for the president while leading the Justice Department, he also manages the team that is involved daily in vetting potential nominees for the bench and then getting them through the Senate.

White House Counsel Don McGahn has led the president's team inside the White House on judicial nominations, playing an "outsized role"— a criticism when coming from the president's opponents, but high praise when coming from Republicans—in researching potential nominees for their qualifications and conservative philosophy, and recommending them to the president for nomination.

Second, the president has built relationships with key coalition partners. The Federalist Society has demonstrated its unequaled capacity and potential as a vetting network and farm team for conservative lawyers and judges. The Heritage Foundation has also lent its tremendous brain-power and gravitas to helping identify and suggest potential picks for the bench. And the Judicial Crisis Network has become the foremost organization in the nation for informing voters and mobilizing grassroots support to motivate senators to confirm the president's conservative nominees.

Third, President Trump has developed effective partners in two leading senators.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has been pushing one nominee after another through his committee, and ended the blue-slip courtesy that Democrats were using to veto the president's nominees.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who is sometimes at odds with the GOP base, is scoring high marks with that base for his resolve and effectiveness at successfully confirming President Trump's judges. He moved forward on judicial nominees that the leftwing American Bar Association opposed. McConnell also pledged to keep the Senate in session for however many days it would take to burn through Democrats' post-cloture 30-hour windows to successfully confirm the president's nominees.

The president's critics cannot deny his success when it comes to the courts. Even the National Review has gone from #NeverTrump to #TrumpIsAwesome on judicial picks.

Despite strained efforts by his opponents to deny him successes, President Trump has had phenomenal success in 2017 fulfilling his campaign promise to appoint principled conservatives to the U.S. Supreme Court and lower courts, with more in store for 2018—including another likely Supreme Court vacancy shortly before the 2018 midterm elections.

Partial transcript as follows:

BASH: Speaking of 2018, I think it is fair to say you've had a strange relationship with Steve Bannon. I'm trying to be nice now. He recently backed Roy Moore for senate in Alabama and is talking about looking ahead to more races where he's going to try to usurp the incumbents. When Moore was senator, you said it was a good day for America in the sense that Bannon lost. Do you believe that because of that, the president is going to stay away from the candidates that Bannon supports in 2018?

SCARAMUCCI: I can't speak for the president on that. I know he's got a good relationship with Steve.

BASH: Are you urging him to ignore Bannon's advice for now?

SCARAMUCCI: Not at all. I think what we have all found with the president, that he's got a very strong constitution and personality. You can offer him advice, but he's going in the direction that he wants to go in, with irrespective of the advice. But specifically as it relates to Steve, I always got on with Steve. I guess there was a situation where he thought it was important for him to diverge with me that's fine, it is nothing personal for me. Steve and I actually on a lot of the ideological areas are quite similar. I think he's a great writer and has been by and large a force for good, but there are certain things that he does that I don't like. And I have no problem speaking out against those. And he's felt free to speak out against me, and that is fine. At the end of the day, it was a new page, a new year. So I'm looking forward to finding ways to getting along with Steve and finding common interests like we did during the campaign.HOUSTON, Texas — Houston police found a "small arsenal" of guns in a top-floor hotel room just hours before a scheduled New Year's Eve celebration. The hotel is an open-atrium design that could allow a shooter to fire upon the celebrating crowd.

UPDATE 3:00 p.m.: Houston police concluded their interview with the suspect and concluded they weapons were being stored in the hotel room "for safekeeping."

Hyatt suspect interview concluded. Placed firearms in hotel room for safekeeping while. Based on limited amount of ammunition, interview & other investigative findings no unlawful intent found. Suspect has been booked & charged with assaulting Peace Officer & trespassing. — Chief Art Acevedo (@ArtAcevedo) December 31, 2017

Houston police have charged a man with assaulting a police officer and criminal trespass after they reported finding a number of firearms in his top-floor hotel. The hotel is the scene of one of Houston's largest New Year's Eve celebrations. Officials said this is "not a Las Vegas" type of incident, according to the Houston Chronicle.

The suspect has been identified as Russell Lawrence Ziemba, 49, the Houston Chronicle reported Sunday afternoon.

Chief Acevedo later tweeted a response to someone asking if this conclusion was to "calm the fears of the people." The chief tweeted:

More like being transparent, engaged & factual. Bringing firearms into hotel, getting drunk, acting the fool, trespassing, resisting arrest & assaulting a peace officer is never a minor deal nor a good idea. We left no stone unturned to determine intent. #RelationalPolicing — Chief Art Acevedo (@ArtAcevedo) December 31, 2017

UPDATE 2:00 p.m.: Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo tweeted that the situation at the hotel is "contained." He said there are "No specific threats."

Situation from this morning at downtown hotel is contained. No specific threats to @HoustonTX. @houstonpolice will be heavily deployed throughout the city to include SWAT react teams. Proud of officers & Hyatt. As always be vigilant & report suspicious a activity to authorities. — Chief Art Acevedo (@ArtAcevedo) December 31, 2017

The Houston Chronicle reported that police found an AR-15, a shotgun, and a handgun, with many rounds of ammunition. Police are reportedly waiting for the as yet unidentified suspect to sober up before asking him why he came to the hotel with multiple firearms.

ORIGINAL STORY FOLLOWS:

Just hours before a massive New Year's Eve celebration at the Houston Hyatt Regency Hotel, an off-duty Houston police officer working security for the hotel encountered an allegedly intoxicated man who acted "erratically and belligerent," KTRK ABC13 reported.

After having difficulty subduing the man, the officer called for "urgent backup." The call went out at about 1:30 a.m. Sunday.

Responding officers found "a small arsenal of guns" in his top-floor hotel room, Click2Houston reported. The officers called investigators to the scene.

The detectives discovered more weapons in his vehicle.

The Hyatt Regency, located in downtown Houston, is a traditional New Year's Eve hotspot for the Bayou City. The open-atrium hotel is staged to drop more than 5,000 ballons on partiers as the clock strikes midnight — signaling the arrival of 2018.

The open-atrium design of the hotel could allow the man a sniper-like position from the hallway of the top floor.

Police arrested the man on charges of unlawfully carrying a weapon and trespassing, KHOU CBS11 reported.

The suspect allegedly had ammunition in his room in addition to several firearms.

Hours later, a tow truck could be seen removing a white Chevrolet pickup truck from the hotel's garage.

The Hyatt Regency is a gun-free zone according to its website. The hotel posts 30.06 and 30.07 signs to advise licensed handgun holders they may not carry a handgun, open or concealed, on the property. Other firearms and unlicensed gun owners would likely be prohibited from possessing firearms on site under state liquor laws.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story that will be updated with new information as it becomes available.The regime controlling state sponsor of terror Iran has organized "rallies" to counter the largest anti-establishment protests since 2009, prompting clashes between demonstrators and the regime's security forces who have reportedly killed at least two protesters.



"Two protesters have reportedly been shot dead as clashes broke out between anti-government demonstrators and police for the third day in several Iranian cities and towns," reports Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). "A video posted on social media on December 30 purported to show two protesters after they were shot dead by riot police in the western town of Dorud."

Although RFE/RL was unable to verify the authenticity of the video, Voice of America (VOA) reportedly identified the victims as Hamzeh Lashni and Hossein Reshno.

While a surge in prices of basic food supplies and alleged corruption fueled anti-government protesters, state-sponsored rallies were reportedly intended to mark the end of the tensions that gripped the country in 2009 after a disputed presidential election.

"Saturday's protests, in fact, coincided with state-sponsored rallies staged across the Islamic Republic to mark the final suppression of the 2009 unrest by security forces, with mass pro-government events in Tehran and Mashhad, Iran's second city," notes Reuters, adding, "Videos posted on social media from the western town of Dorud showed two young men lying motionless on the ground, covered with blood, and a voiceover said they had been shot dead by riot police firing on protesters."

Despite facing oppression at the hands of security forces deployed by the Iranian regime, the anti-government rallies have reportedly spread to various cities, including the Iranian capital Tehran, where demonstrators have been chanting slogans against the Islamic establishment and Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Media reports suggest some protesters set ablaze some government buildings and police vehicles.

"Seyed Ali [Khamenei] shame on you. Leave The Country Alone," protesters chanted at the university, referring to Iran's Supreme Leader, a video obtained by RFE/FL purportedly shows.

"We've seen pictures of [Khamenei] ripped from the billboards at the sides of streets. We've heard protesters call for his overthrow," said CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson. "This is something different. This is something the regime is going to take very seriously."

In other videos posted on social media, protesters are chanting, "Death to the dictator" and "The nation is struggling in poverty; the leader is trying to act as God."

Iran's Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri, an ally of Iran's President Hassan Rohani, responded to the protests in a move described as unusual, pointed out RFE/FL.

Officials say her husband is identified as part-owner of some brothels in Reynosa.

Carlos Peña Garza, the husband of Reynosa Mayor Maki Ortiz, is singled out as being part owner of some of the establishments that were shut down following the investigation, information provided to Breitbart Texas by the Tamaulipas Attorney General's Office revealed.

This week, Tamaulipas state officials raided four clandestine bars and three makeshift hotels that were reportedly being used as brothels. The businesses were all in an area known as the "Zona de Tolerancia" or "Boys Town." According to the officials, issues of public safety and the regulation of businesses in the "zona de tolerancia" is a matter that is handled by the city, not the state.

State authorities carried out the raids as part of an investigation into human trafficking and sex trafficking that had started after Mexico's Grupo Radio Formula published an expose on sex trafficking and forced child prostitution in the border city. The shutting down of the businesses came after management at the various establishments were not able to provide the needed permits to operate as bars, while the makeshift hotels did not meet sanitary standards.

Officials identified Peña Garza as a part owner of some of the establishments allegedly used by the forced-prostitution ring.

The Gallup news report on the poll only mentions the first lady once but shows her ranking in a graphic.

Joining [Hillary] Clinton, Queen Elizabeth II and Winfrey in the Top 10 this year are Michelle Obama, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, first lady Melania Trump, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton and Beyonce Knowles. Trump, Haley and Knowles are new to the Top 11.

Haley — who also beat out Middleton and Beyonce to earn the No. 9 spot — is mentioned twice. Aside from making the Top 11, Haley was also named by 3 percent of Republicans as their most admired woman.

The Gallup story mostly focuses on the winners of the "most admired" men and women poll, which again this year was Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, respectively.

In Obama's case, his win over President Donald Trump was by only 3 percent and Michelle Obama's 7 percent was just two percentage points less than Clinton.

Also, Gallup reported that Clinton won most admired in the same poll that showed a personal low favorable rating of 36 percent, according to Gallup, and the shift in rankings:

But Clinton's and Obama's standings this year are more tenuous than in the past. The 9% who name Clinton is the lowest percentage she has received since 2002, when 7% named her in another close first-place finish. Clinton won the title this year in the same poll she registered a personal low favorable rating. This indicates she remains top of mind for enough people who like her to be named more than any other woman in response to the open-ended question, finishing ahead of some women who may be better liked overall but are not as prominent in people's minds. The percentage of adults naming Obama as the most admired man is down from 22% last year, but he has been at or near 17% in several other years.

The survey was based on telephone interviews conducted Dec. 4-11, 2017, from a random sample of 1,049 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.

The margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points with a 95% confidence level, Gallup reported.A Mexican police chief believed to be working with drug cartels by providing protection was arrested along with two officers.

A press release from the state prosecutors office reports that the chief of police from Namiquipa, Chihuahua, and two police officers were arrested during an operation carried out by agents of the state attorney general's office after an investigation revealed the three were providing protection to Arturo Quintana Quintana, "El 80". Quintana is a top leader within the Juarez Cartel, according to local media reports.

At the time of their arrests, they were found in possession of five long rifles that are classified for the exclusive use of the armed forces; three handguns; tactical equipment; ammo; a significant quantity of crystal amphetamine; and a vehicle that was illegally in the country.

Namiquipa is approximately 125 miles west of the state capital of Chihuahua and is in the path of what is considered a key drug smuggling route into the United States. The region has been plagued by violence as the Sinaloa Cartel seeks to displace Nuevo Cartel de Juárez (NCDJ) that maintains control of western Chihuahua. The violent confrontations are occurring between members of La Linea–the armed wing of the Juarez Cartel–and La Gente Nueva—loyal to the Sinaloa Cartel.

"El 80" is considered a top priority target for law enforcement since much of the cartel violence is attributed to his organization. Quintana is also listed as a wanted fugitive by the U.S. Department of Justice for various drug trafficking and smuggling charges in connection with the Juarez Cartel.

Breitbart Texas previously reported on Quintana's criminal activities. He was originally believed to be responsible for the high profile murder of journalist Miroslava Breach but in October, the state attorney general's office identified members of La Gente Nueva within the Sinaloa Cartel as the responsible party, according to media reports.

The three detainees were placed at the disposal of the federal authorities, who will take the lead of the investigation with assistance from the state attorney general's office.

Robert Arce is a retired Phoenix Police detective with extensive experience working Mexican organized crime and street gangs. Arce has worked in the Balkans, Iraq, Haiti, and recently completed a three-year assignment in Monterrey, Mexico, working out of the Consulate for the United States Department of State, International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Program, where he was the Regional Program Manager for Northeast Mexico (Coahuila, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Durango, San Luis Potosi, Zacatecas.)A 15-year-old girl in the German town of Kandel was stabbed to death by her Afghan ex-boyfriend in a local drug store, shocking locals.

The attack occurred earlier this week and saw Afghan asylum seeker Abdul D. stab 15-year-old Mia repeatedly with a kitchen knife until customers were able to drag him off her and hold him until police arrived, Bild reports.

According to investigators, the incident came as a result of a dispute between the asylum seeker and the victim, who no longer wanted to be in a relationship with him. The parents of the victim also told police that Abdul D. had threatened their daughter earlier this month, and had told her he was going to "take care" of her.

Abdul came to Germany in April 2016 illegally claiming to be an unaccompanied minor seeking asylum. Investigators say they are in the process of trying to determine whether or not Abdul lied about his age when he entered the country.

Alexander Gauland, chairman of the anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, reacted to the murder by saying the case "shows once again that the authorities have nothing under control. The catastrophic combination of open borders and failure of officials is deadly to our society."

Despite the extreme nature of the case, German public broadcaster ARD refused to report on it initially, claiming that they hesitated because it involved minors and relationship issues.

Last year the broadcaster was slammed for failing to report a similar case in which Maria Ladenburger, the daughter of a senior EU official, was allegedly raped and killed by another Afghan migrant claiming to be a minor.

ARD claimed the case was "too regional" despite the murder receiving international coverage.

Trial Opens for Migrant Accused of Raping, Murdering German Medical Student Maria Ladenburger https://t.co/bFMgRXpuo7 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 5, 2017

The trial of Hussein Khavari, who is alleged to have raped and killed Ms Ladenburger, is still ongoing, and the case bears some similarities to the murder of 15-year-old Maria.

Like Abdul D., Khavari was originally from Afghanistan and came into the country claiming to be an underage asylum seeker.

It was later revealed that not only was Khavari not 17 as he claimed but, according to his own father, he is 33-years-old.

A verdict in the case is expected in the spring of 2018.Shortly after being elected president, Donald Trump signed an executive order directing all federal agencies to find two regulations to cut for every new one issued. Agencies also were asked to pay for new regulatory costs by eliminating existing rules.

In December, Trump said the goals set out in that executive order had not only been met but exceeded.

"We blew our target out of the water," Trump said, noting that his administration had eliminated 22 regulations for every new one put in place.

The Associated Press reported on Trump's remarks at the White House as he stood next to giant stacks of paper representing the regulatory slashing his administration has done over the past year.

"For many decades, an ever-growing maze of regulations, rules, restrictions has cost our country trillions and trillions of dollars, millions of jobs, countless American factories, and devastated many industries," Trump said.

AP reported:

Neomi Rao, the administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, said the administration had completed 67 deregulatory actions and taken three regulatory actions through the end of September that would result in a cost savings of $570 million a year. Those deregulatory actions include a wide range of actions, including the withdrawal of guidance documents and reductions in paperwork burdens, and a dozen regulations killed by Congress, Rao said. More than 1,500 regulations other rules and regulations have been withdrawn, delayed, or are under reconsideration, officials said.

AP said that Trump expressed support for some federal regulations, including ones that protect workers' health and safety and preserve national parks and other natural resources in the United States.

But, Trump said as he cut the ribbon on the massive stack, "every unnecessary page in these stacks represents hidden tax and harmful burdens to American workers and American businesses."

The Trump policy is explained on the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs website where the Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions is posted:

This agenda represents this administration's next step in fundamental regulatory reform and a reorientation toward reducing unnecessary regulatory burden on the American people. By amending and eliminating regulations that are ineffective, duplicative, and obsolete, the Administration can promote economic growth and innovation and protect individual liberty.

The numbers show that 1,579 regulations have been withdrawn or put in "delayed action status."

Critics, however, have challenged Trump's claims, according to AP.

Stuart Shapiro, a Rutgers University professor who worked at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs during the Clinton and Bush presidencies, is one of them.

"There's some reality there and a lot of bluster," Shapiro said, adding that deregulating rules is just as time-consuming as adding new regulations and nothing is certain until the process is complete.A report entitled "Mapping the Swamp" describes a bureaucracy reportedly consisting of bloated paychecks and enormous incentives for government employees.

The report was published by OpenTheBooks.com, self-described with a mission to "post 'Every dime, Online, In Real Time,' of federal, state, and local government spending to provide transparency for smart government." Open The Books is a function of American Transparency, a public charity that refuses government money and "[presents] hard data without policy recommendations," in order to "enhanced public discourse with delineated facts."

The cover of the report features quotes from both Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and President Ronald Reagan. It poses three essential questions: "Should the federal government reassess its payroll priorities?" Second, "is it necessary to maintain an expansive and costly bureaucracy?" Finally, "Does a large and widespread federal workforce facilitate good government?"

Inside, the report details the roughly $1 million per minute that taxpayers spend on the $136 billion in pay and benefits to federal workers — over $20.6 billion of which is contained within the Washington, DC "Beltway" alone. Recent years have reportedly seen a marked increase in large payouts, with 165% more federal employees making more than $200,000 a year, and 406,960 making at least $100,000. These findings prompted Open The Books to dub $100,000 the "minimum wage" for government employees.

The most-paid man in the federal government is reportedly a heart surgeon at the Department of Veterans Affairs who is bringing in $403,849 annually, while the largest bonus was reportedly $141,525 paid out to a human resources manager at Presidio Trust in San Francisco. The aforementioned surgeon makes more money than President Donald Trump himself. The average worker takes 10 holidays off, 13 sick days, and 20 vacations days — and up to two full months of vacation, after three years' employment.

Federal employees are currently expected to receive a pay increase as part of an order signed by the POTUS.Indeed, Garrison says that while the players have a right to their opinion they also have great power with their positions as highly paid, professional athletes and should chose a more suitable time and place to let their voices be heard about the problems they say trouble the country:

"There has been the huge tidal change in racial makeup of the player base in the NFL. Over these decades we have witnessed the advent of that base go from a pretty small minority to what is now a clear and growing majority status of blacks over whites throughout teams and at every position on offense and defense. Of course there have been grumps and blind men who have decried it all, complaining about the ethnic differences and even the complexion (no pun intended) of the media crowd as well.

...

With African American players accounting for a huge portion of the active salaries throughout the NFL — again only right, given their contributions and consistent skills—and with their visibility on and off the field in all walks of public discourse comes one feature that has been lacking and now threatens the sport. It is that sense of responsibility that comes from such powerful, even overwhelming influence at every level.

...

The vast majority of players do not commit acts of domestic abuse, but go home after work and raise fine families. In further point of fact, domestic issues such as those so hyped among the media vultures are far less common than in the rest of the population. They commit fewer suicides, fewer felonies and use illicit drugs less than the rest of the population as well. What makes no sense, however, is for these successful folk not to recognize that with all that success comes the necessary responsibility to refrain from damaging their own brand and the future of that enterprise that has provided them with such opportunity and success.Foundational Hatha Yoga by Jamie – Every other Monday at Santosha, 6-7pm

She experienced her first of many manifestations and adopted a baby locally in only 5 months. She then conceived and has 2 beautiful girls who are 8 months apart. Camryn Faith is 12 and has Autism. She is the most joyous, loving child who rarely suffers in her world. She lives in the moment, goes with the flow of life, and accepts changes along the way. Jordyn Hope is 11 and is a wise, spiritual, old soul who shares her infinite intelligence with her Mom often. She is an incredible dancer!

Jamie is a pediatric Occupational Therapist and loves what she does! She received her 200 hour Yoga Teacher Certification in 2014 and now integrates yoga as well as her other holistic modalities in her student's lives. She also opened her own side business, Back to Basics Therapy in 2019. Jamie has been on a learning journey and feels it is time to give back.

Foundational Hatha Yoga by Jamie – Every other Monday at Santosha, 6-7pm

This class will focus on the basics of Yoga. Hatha Yoga's literal translation is, "sun/moon" and keeping the balance of the 2. Philosophy, breathing/prana, and beginner yoga poses (asanas) will all be integrated to create a more balanced mind/body/spirit. What we practice on the mat can slowly be integrated into life off the mat. Please bring a mat, strap/belt, towel/blanket, and yoga blocks if possible.Cacao plants are slated to disappear by as early as 2050 thanks to warmer temperatures and dryer weather conditions.

Scientists at the University of California are teaming up with Mars company to try to save the crop before it's too late.

They're exploring the possibility of using the gene-editing technology CRISPR to make crops that can survive the new challenges.

Beyond the glittery glass-and-sandstone walls of the University of California's new biosciences building, rows of tiny green cacao seedlings in refrigerated greenhouses await judgment day.

Under the watchful eye of Myeong-Je Cho, the director of plant genomics at an institute that's working with food and candy company Mars, the plants will be transformed. If all goes well, these tiny seedlings will soon be capable of surviving - and thriving - in the dryer, warmer climate that is sending chills through the spines of farmers across the globe.

It's all thanks to a new technology called CRISPR, which allows for tiny, precise tweaks to DNA that were never possible before. These tweaks are already being used to make crops cheaper and more reliable. But their most important use may be in the developing world, where many of the plants that people rely on to avoid starvation are threatened by the impacts of climate change, including more pests and a lack of water.

Cacao plants occupy a precarious position on the globe. They can only grow within a narrow strip of rainforested land roughly 20 degrees north and south of the equator, where temperature, rain, and humidity all stay relatively constant throughout the year. Over half of the world's chocolate now comes from just two countries in West Africa - Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana.

But those areas won't be suitable for chocolate in the next few decades. By 2050, rising temperatures will push today's chocolate-growing regions more than 1,000 feet uphill into mountainous terrain - much of which is currently preserved for wildlife, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Mars, the $35 billion corporation best known for Snickers, is aware of these problems and others presented by climate change.

In September, the company pledged $1 billion as part of an effort called "Sustainability in a Generation," which aims to reduce the carbon footprint of its business and supply chain by more than 60% by 2050.

"We're trying to go all in here," Barry Parkin, Mars' chief sustainability officer, told Business Insider. "There are obviously commitments the world is leaning into but, frankly, we don't think we're getting there fast enough collectively."

Its initiative with Cho at UC Berkeley is another arm of that efforts. If all goes as planned, they could develop cacao plants that don't wilt or rot at their current elevations, doing away with the need to relocate farms or find another approach.

Jennifer Doudna, the UC Berkeley geneticist who invented CRISPR, is overseeing the collaboration with Mars. Although her tool has received more attention for its potential to eradicate human diseases and make so-called "designer babies," Doudna thinks its most profound applications won't be on humans but rather on the food they eat.

An avid tomato gardener, Doudna thinks her tool can benefit everyone from large food companies like Mars to individual hobbyists like herself.

"Personally, I'd love a tomato plant with fruit that stayed on the vine longer," Doudna told Business Insider.

The research lab she oversees at UC Berkeley is called the Innovative Genomics Institute. Many of the efforts by graduate students there focus on using CRISPR to benefit small-holder farmers in the developing world. One such project aims to protect cassava - a key crop that prevents millions of people from starving each year - from climate change by tweaking its DNA to produce less of a dangerous toxin that it makes in hotter temperatures.

Doudna founded a company called Caribou Biosciences to put CRISPR into practice, and has also licensed the technology to agricultural company DuPont Pioneer for use in crops like corn and mushrooms.

Regardless of which crop the public sees CRISPR successfully used in first, the technology will be a key tool in a growing arsenal of techniques we'll need if we plan to continue eating things like chocolate as the planet warms.Meals on Wheels, among the most iconic and popular social programs in America, should be gearing up to deal with the impending increase in demand.

But instead, the program faces funding shortfalls and service cutbacks. This year, its programs served 23 million fewer meals than in 2005.

Funding cuts could mean even fewer seniors could be helped.



Five times a week for nearly 20 years, Meals on Wheels program coordinator Leisa Cotten would bring warm meals to the immobile and elderly of Cochise County, in the rural southeast corner of Arizona.

But for the past decade, she's had to switch it up. Now she delivers frozen meals, five at a time, once a week. "I haven't seen you in a while" says Mark, one of Cotten's clients (and whose name we have changed here), as she walks into his trailer.

"Cutbacks," Cotten replies, rearranging his freezer to fit the five white microwavable trays into the top row. "You coming back next week?" he asks. "I should be," Cotten says.

In 2011, the first cohort of the 75 million baby boomers turned 65. Over the next 18 years, they will continue to age, and the country's population pyramid will grow increasingly vase-shaped. Caring for the tens of millions of boomers is a demographic challenge without precedent in the United States.

Meals on Wheels, among the most iconic and popular social programs in America, should be gearing up to deal with the impending increase in demand. But instead, the program faces funding shortfalls and service cutbacks. This year, its programs served 23 million fewer meals than in 2005. One estimate shows that less than a fifth of eligible seniors can actually avail themselves of home-delivered meals because of limited resources.

Today, Cotten has a single assistant to help her serve a county larger than Connecticut. In 1987, she oversaw a staff of 36 that served thousands of meals a year. And her program isn't the only one—today, Meals on Wheels programs around the country are withering just as Americans need them more and more.

Few anti-poverty programs have the virtuous sheen and cultural cache of Meals on Wheels. The home-delivered meal service, which in various iterations has fed millions of frail seniors over seven decades, enjoys a singular spot in the imagination of would-be American altruists, a hybrid of soup-kitchen ladling and escorting veterans across streets.

Public figures (and Fight Club anti-heroines) avail themselves of the glow. Politicians constantly include Meals on Wheels in press flyers, and in March, Colin Kaepernick donated $50,000 to Meals on Wheels America—a charitable rebuke to those critical of his civil rights activism.

MOWA is the umbrella organization that oversees and advocates for the thousands of individual Meals on Wheels chapters, which are run by local service organizations, like Catholic Community Services, in Cotten's case.

In aggregate, chapters receive a third of their funding from a provision of the Older Americans Act signed into law by President Nixon in 1972, and the rest comes from state and local governments, corporate donations, and individual donations. MOWA prides itself on facilitating a "successful public-private partnership." (Some programs, like Cotten's, do not officially affiliate with MOWA but still benefit from their advocacy and receive federal funding.)

Advocates claim that the services Meals on Wheels chapters provide are multipotent: Home visitors bring not just food to frail seniors but also offer companionship and referrals to social services. The deliveries also encourage clients to perform "activities of daily living" like housework and dressing themselves as they prepare for guests.

"We're required to observe everything: their verbal and visual ability, emotional health, their skin color," Cotten said. "If we notice anything—if they're unstable walking—we call a case manager. If it's critical, we call 911." Ninety percent of seniors on the program say that Meals on Wheels "makes them feel more safe and secure."

But virtue and a sense of safety aren't enough to pay for lunch. Broadly speaking, we underfund social programs for the elderly. Less than 2 percent of corporate, community, and foundation donations go to programs related to aging, which has been a problem for Meals on Wheels programs.

"There's more and more competition for a smaller share of donations," said Ellie Hollander, CEO of MOWA. For more than a decade—in which both political parties have had their shots at controlling Congress and the White House—federal funding for the OAA has been flat while the cost of food and inflation have both increased and tens of millions of baby boomers retire.

To Democrats, the OAA is important but low on their list of priorities. After gaining control of Congress and the White House in 2008, they spent their political capital on a stimulus bill, financial reform, health care reform, and cap and trade. All of these policies are orders of magnitude more expansive than the OAA, and some, like health care reform, overlap with the services that the OAA provides.

Admittedly, the OAA got a 22 percent funding boost in 2009 as part of the stimulus and a comparable bump in 2010 for a senior jobs program. But in 2011, after Democrats lost control of the House, the OAA funding returned to its baseline of about $1.9 billion, where it's stayed since.

In March of 2016, 30 Democratic Senators signed a letter circulated by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders calling for a "minimum 12 percent increase"—a sincere gesture without any chance of passing. After 2011 budget negotiations, caps were placed on nonmandatory spending, which includes Meals on Wheels. The program may carry political currency, referenced in wish lists and attack ads, but it rarely ends up in congressional debate.

Republican reservations are varied. On one side of the spectrum is Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who expressed skepticism about the efficacy of the entire OAA during a 2011 hearing on senior hunger. Other Republicans equivocate. In September, Rep. Martha McSally, who represents Leisa Cotten in Cochise County, pushed for a $14.2 million increase for senior services under the OAA.

A press release touted her support for Meals on Wheels, even though her amendment technically funded different programs. This month, McSally voted for several versions of a GOP tax bill, which, among many cuts, removed $1.7 billion in funding from Meals on Wheels and other social programs. That's like giving clients a packet of crackers and then taking away their steak.

What's more, advocates for older Americans are wary of using the modest political power they have. AARP, though formidable, is notoriously reluctant to throw its weight behind all but what it deems the most important fights, like the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Its membership also skews more affluent than those who receive Meals on Wheels. MOWA doesn't have the money or activated constituency to command much clout on its own.

"Many people who in fact most use and need social benefits are simply not voting at all," observed Alec MacGillis, writing in 2015 about the decline of the safety net. MOWA officials are more likely to get a meeting with a first-year legislative aide instead of a senator.

Plus, the organization is determined to maintain its nonpartisan appeal, making it less inclined to weaponize its reputation against the politicians who pay only lip service. (MOWA also has an interest in not alienating its clients or the volunteers on whom it relies.)

Compounding the problem, the data on Meals on Wheels haven't been robust until recently. A literature review in 2015 found that most studies related to home-delivered meal programs were small, unrigorously designed, and measured "self-reported dietary intake," an unreliable metric. (Try measuring what you eat for a week.)

Though senior nutrition advocates swore by the program, the lack of data made it harder to argue for more funding and may be the reason the OAA's nutrition program has floundered. For many poverty programs, robust data are necessary for survival but not sufficient. Meals on Wheels programs are stuck in an appropriations purgatory where many don't receive enough money to stay at capacity, much less expand, but they're too adored to be cut much without political reprisal.

Better data has emerged in the past five years—and its delivered a compelling case for the programs. In 2013, Kali Thomas, a public health researcher at Brown University, published a paper that found "if all states had increased by 1 percent the number of adults age 65 or older who received home-delivered meals in 209 under title III of the OAA, total annual savings to states' Medicaid programs could have exceeded $109 million."

Most of the savings would come from keeping seniors in their homes and out of nursing homes, which are more expensive. Ninety-two percent of Meals on Wheels recipients say the service lets them live at home. The Medicaid savings were uneven—some states saved millions while other lost out—but Meals on Wheels likely saves billions in Medicare spending too.

In 2016, Thomas found that receiving home-delivered meals was correlated with a 30 percent decrease in falls for seniors who've fallen before. Falls—in which seniors can break a hip, or worse—cost Medicare $31 billion in 2015 alone. What's more, collaboration between MOWA and Brown University found that rates of hospitalization and emergency-room use decreased for patients getting Meals on Wheels compared to those who weren't.

For context, one night in the emergency room costs the same as a year of home-delivered meals. This evidence is in line with macroscopic public health findings that countries that spend more on social services than health services tend to have longer life expectancies and decreased rates of premature mortality.

Meals on Wheels could help address the greatest health care and demographic challenge Americans face this century—that is, if it were treated as more than a pet program or hollow political prop. Until then, millions of seniors will starve in the richest country in history.

As we left Mark's trailer, I asked Cotten what happens when Meals on Wheels can't afford to bring a client food anymore. "We do everything we can to avoid that," she said. "We don't want to play God." Many branches have stopped adding to their waitlists—some hundreds long—because they don't want to offer false hope.

Today, Meals on Wheels has become something all too familiar to the program—a 70-year-old everyone claims to love but few actually care for.December 30, 2017 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

For a price of 37,500 GBP, roughly $50,000, this "Diablo" comes powered by a BMW-sourced 5.0-liter V12 paired to a six-speed manual transmission sourced from Audi. Okay, so far so decent. It has just 1,700 miles and we're assuming those were all put on once the build was completed. The ad is, unfortunately, a bit vague when it comes to specifics like that. It does mention, however, the engine was stripped and rebuilt before it was installed in the fake Lambo. Speaking of which, nowhere does it mention the source of the chassis. Was it custom-built or taken from a donor car? Parallel Designs does write the chassis consist of a "semi-spaceframe design with integral central backbone providing excellent strength and rigidity."The province's plan to offer free prescription medications to young people kicks in Jan. 1, but some critics are already questioning whether the plan goes far enough.

About 4,400 medications — including things like asthma inhalers and EpiPens — will be available to anyone under the age of 25 for free, provided they have an OHIP number, according to the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.

But pharmacist Mike Hannalah, of Smith's Pharmacy in north Toronto, says the list of medications not covered in the new plan is too long.

Progressive Conservative health critic Jeff Yurek (centre) argues the new plan doesn't include enough coverage for young people living with rare diseases. (Queen's Park)

"There'll be those kinds of surprises," he told CBC Toronto. "IVs, injections, brand name versus generic — it's a long list."

Ontario's Progressive Conservative health critic Jeff Yurek echoed those concerns. He called the plan a good first step, but he also said it doesn't go far enough.

"It doesn't reach all the people who need coverage, including those living with rare diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, who rely on life-saving drugs," Yurek said in a statement.

The provincial Liberals announced the program, called OHIP+, in last spring's budget.

It's expected to cost about $450 million a year and affect about four million people province-wide, regardless of income, said Eric Hoskins, minister of health and long-term care.

"It will mean that a significant number of Ontarians that we know are not taking their medications because they can't afford them will not have that financial worry," Hoskins said.

Hoskins added that the new program is essentially an expansion of a plan that's currently available to Ontario's seniors and those on Ontario Works, which offers financial and employment help to residents of the province.

It covers "the simplest things from ointment or creams for a skin rash, to the most complicated — so drugs for cancer," he said. "It's the biggest expansion of medicare in this province since the creation of medicare itself."

Under the plan, young people or their parents can show up at their local pharmacy with an OHIP card and a prescription written by a doctor or nurse practitioner. Hoskins said there will be no up-front fees, or co-payments to have the prescription filled.

Ontario Minister of Health and Long-Term Care Eric Hoskins says the new pharmacare plan will affect about 4 million young people. (CBC News)

"This will really make a difference in the bottom line, in the family, the household finances, so they'll be able to direct those funds where they are needed most."

Some of the newly-covered medications:

Antibiotics to treat infections.

Inhalers for asthma.

Various insulins, oral diabetic medications and diabetes test strips.

Epinephrine auto-injectors (e.g. EpiPen).

Drugs to treat arthritis, epilepsy and other chronic conditions.

Medications to treat mental health conditions (e.g. antidepressants).

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) drugs.

Drugs to treat some childhood cancers and other rare conditions.

But now, incidents of violence by students against teachers has exploded into a bona fide workplace hazard, one that my profession seems to be witnessing — and worse, tolerating — with alarming frequency.

Just how often it is happening?

A survey by my provincial union, the Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association, found that 60 per cent of teachers (both elementary and secondary) have personally experienced violence on the job.

A disturbing 70 per cent of teachers (myself included) have witnessed acts of violence in the school. Weapons were involved in 15 per cent of these attacks, which included classroom objects (76 per cent) and knives (22 per cent).

Public taking notice

Thankfully, there is growing awareness that this is happening, though it often takes an extreme example — such as that of an Ottawa teacher left with a shattered hip after a violent encounter — to capture mainstream attention. And while I take some comfort in the fact that people are starting to take notice, there is another dimension to the problem here — one that my fellow teachers need to both take ownership of and work to tackle as part of our defensive strategy against violence.

That is: way too many teachers show an endemic reluctance to report and follow up on incidents of violence and harassment that they are made to endure. Compounding the problem is that many principals end up encouraging teachers who do come forward to "let it go" or "forgive." According to the aforementioned survey, nearly 25 per cent of teachers who experienced violence were told not to report the incident to police. Even worse, teachers are sometimes made to feel that they might have brought it on themselves.

Educators have an absolute duty to document and report violent incidents in the school. But when it comes to violence by students against teachers, the demand for justice seems to enter a moral maze of rationalizing guilt and uncertainty.

The principal who might respond with pathological zeal to any form of attack or harassment against a student will often hesitate and mitigate when a student attacks a teacher. That's because actively supporting and protecting the teacher could mean an ongoing legal problem for the principal. It seems today's principals would rather leave the problem in the teachers' hands, even if that means they suffer in silence. Indeed, the disciplinary brick wall that was once the principal's office is now not much more than a speed bump.

But while administrators deserve some of the blame, there is also the absurdly illogical sense of sacrifice, submission and self-guilt that way too many teachers feel when they experience violence in the classroom.

Reluctance to report

Certainly no teacher would fail to call the police or press charges should he or she be on the receiving end of a violent encounter with a child or teen anywhere outside of the school. But place that same encounter within the confines of the school, and many of the same teachers become fearful and reluctant to report the incident.

The excuses are many, but some of the most common ones I have heard include knowledge or hearsay that the student is going through a difficult time at home. Another consideration that seems to give violent students de-facto immunity is a diagnosis of a learning disability such as oppositional defiance disorder or attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Finally, some teachers worry that by pressing charges and reporting the incident to police, they will somehow ruin all possible chances for the student's future success at college or university.

In a statement on violence in the classroom, the British Columbia Teachers Federation affirmed that "often teachers are reluctant to assert their rights to work in a safe environment" and that "those who teach violent young students are embarrassed to admit that five and six year olds have hurt them."

Some teachers worry about ruining a student's chance at future success by reporting a violent encounter. (Shutterstock/iChzigo)

Whatever the excuse or mitigating circumstances, in the end the only real reason why this form of violence is still being tolerated is because teachers end up prioritizing a violent student's interests and needs above the teacher's own physical well-being.

That should stop. We can't teach and preach ad nauseam about the need to eradicate domestic violence around the world, for example, yet rationalize and tolerate teachers in their own workplace being kicked, shoved, bitten and punched by students.

Teachers must demand that all levels of school administration — right up to our respective ministers of education — guarantee, without exception, excuse or mitigation, our right to a safe workplace.

If we truly believe that our working conditions are the students learning conditions, then we should demand no less.

This column is part of CBC's Opinion section. For more information about this section, please read this editor's blog and our FAQ.In 2017, Justin Trudeau's Liberals wanted to talk about 2027. And that might set things up for 2019.

Buried within the 280-page budget book tabled by Finance Minister Bill Morneau in March was a two-page section entitled "Canada in 10 years." Between the numbers and graphs and charts of the rest of the tome — little of which, one presumes, was read by anyone outside Ottawa — the government's writers allowed themselves to get a bit dreamy.

"Within 10 years," it was imagined, Canadian cities would have "world class public transit systems," while Canadians would benefit from cleaner air, less congestion, bustling ports, digital networks, greater housing, support and care.

"This is the brighter future that all Canadians deserve."

Regardless of whether Canadians deserve it, the Liberals now have less than two years to prove they can be trusted to keep building it.

Lots to worry about in 2018

Complicating matters will be all the other things the Liberals have to worry about.

Barring an indictment, Donald Trump will still be U.S. president. NAFTA will still be up for renegotiation, unless it's suddenly cancelled. The Trans Pacific Partnership hangs in the balance and free trade with China is still an open question.

There's a G7 meeting to host in June. The new infrastructure bank is expected to open. The Trans Mountain pipeline will or won't proceed, inciting protest in either event. The dissolution of the department of Indigenous Affairs will presumably continue. The provinces have until September to put a price on carbon emissions. And at some point in the summer of 2018, marijuana will become available for legal consumption.

But underlying all that will be the big plans the Liberals have now made.

The best-laid plans

The backbone of the promise for 2027 was set in the fall of 2016, with what was billed as a 12-year, $186-billion commitment to infrastructure. The Liberals added $95 billion to what the previous government had budgeted for.

Trudeau recently visited a housing development in Toronto's Lawrence Heights neighbourhood to pledge $40 billion over 10 years as part of a 'human rights-based' housing strategy. (Chris Young/Canadian Press)

From that follow other long-term plans: an 11-year agreement with the provinces to fund child care and early learning services, a 10-year commitment to affordable housing and the federal-provincial framework on climate change.

But Liberal commitments for the next decade go beyond infrastructure.

The new defence policy announced in June forecasts spending through 2026-27. In August, the Trudeau government completed a 10-year, $11-billion commitment to fund mental health and home-care services with the provinces.

Funding for "superclusters" — regional hubs for innovation and technology — goes to 2022. An increase in funding for Indigenous communities is budgeted through 2021.

A new national housing benefit, funded between the federal government and the provinces, is to be launched in 2020.

Some of the above might seem presumptuous, perhaps even cynical. The Liberals will have to be re-elected at least twice to still be in government in 2027.

Extending the timeframe of a commitment allows them to announce a bigger dollar figure. (Granted, that can work both ways. Long-term fiscal projections, for instance, can be used to forecast great piles of new debt.)

But it would also likely be counterproductive to demand that governments restrict themselves to their current mandate. Some amount of forward planning and long-term thinking is surely of benefit to the nation's stability and direction.

The Liberals' challenge for the next two years is to demonstrate they can be counted on to make good on at least the next four years.

Significant outlays are planned before the next election: billions for infrastructure, housing and child care. How many buildings, roads, transit lines and child-care spaces will the prime minister be able to pose in front of over the next year and a half?

The more that is built and done with that money, the better the government's case for re-election might be. Meanwhile, voters should get a sense of what life is like with a price on carbon (including, potentially, any federal rebate that is applied where the federal plan is imposed).

That re-election campaign will presumably feature some call to stick with the Liberal plan. Presuming, of course, that the plan is working.

To 2019, and beyond

All these commitments might limit the Liberals' ability to make many new promises in the 2019 campaign. (At the very least, it should be difficult for them to match 2015's 353 promises).

But could these long-term promises also curtail the Conservative party's ambitions?

Andrew Scheer's Conservatives will no doubt vow to repeal the federal carbon price. But they will presumably also want to run on a platform that includes reduced taxes and a quicker return to budget balance.

Can they do that without cutting into some of the Liberal agenda? If not, which pieces do they want to take on?

Regardless of whether the Liberals are still governing at the end of 2019, the federal government could be contending with their plans for years to come.A 15-year-old in Prince George, B.C., will be spending 2018 trying to revitalize the language her family spoke for generations through an app and a summer camp.

Tessa Erickson is a high school student and a member of the Nak'azdli Whut'en First Nation. Growing up, she said, her father would occasionally speak to her in the Nak'azdli dialect of the Dakelh language historically spoken in central B.C., even though he wasn't fluent.

"He would just teach me small words," Erickson said.

"It was really neat because I could tell my dad something and nobody would really know what it meant, but kind of a bit sad because nobody knew what it meant."

In the 1960s the Carrier Linguistic Society developed a writing system for Dakelh based on the Latin alphabet. (FirstVoices.com)

Erickson learned about residential schools and how older members of her family were prevented from speaking their language, which lead to a decline in those who could speak it.

"We'd lost that part of ourselves," she said.

This year, she decided she wanted things to change.

Working with her parents, she applied for a grant from her band to develop an app and summer camp to help other young people immerse themselves in Dakelh. She received $50,000 and is in the early stages of development now.

Her goal is to have an app up and running in the the early part of 2018 so youth can start learning basic words and sentence structure, then they can attend a camp where they will learn the language from elders and trained speakers.

She is also looking into paying for coding lessons for band members so they can operate and update the app.

Meanwhile, Erickson is working toward fluency, speaking to elders and enrolling in a Dakelh language course in a different but similar dialect at the College of New Caledonia.

Erickson said it's important to her to learn while the elders are still around in her community.

"I feel I haven't quite lived out my full potential as a member of the band because I cannot speak the language and parts of the culture I haven't learned yet," she said.

She also believes it will be good for the Nak'azdli Whut'en as a whole to keep the language alive.

"Bringing back the language could really help us as a community come together culturally. Just, make us stronger and hopefully we can branch out and help out other communities," she said.

She hopes other young people will join her in her mission.

"We are the future. It's up to us."

With files from Jordan TuckerTahoe, the snowy owl, got his moniker with a bang, one so strong it caught him in the vehicle for which he's been dubbed.

Salthaven West, a Regina wildlife rehabilitation centre, often responds to reports of injured animals, but Thursday night's call was different from the norm, according to director Megan Lawrence.

"It's definitely common that owls and other wildlife get hit by vehicles, but this is the first time we've ever attended where one's still been stuck inside the vehicle after being hit," she said.

A driver was travelling south of Regina along the highway when she saw the owl fly into her SUV, and assumed the worst for the bird. After driving a few minutes into the city, she stopped to see if there was damage to the truck.

What she discovered instead was the bright white plumage of a snowy owl, caught within the grille of her Tahoe. She immediately called for assistance, with a local conservation officer contacting Lawrence to respond.

"The faster we get an animal for treatment, the better chance it has for recovery," Lawrence said. "So I'm lucky I was just able to get over there right away and get him out."

Rescue mission

With Thursday's temperatures dipping to as low as –30 C, Lawrence staged a frigid, but fast-acting rescue. Owls can typically be quite aggressive, but with the owl putting up little fight, Lawrence could tell he was badly injured.

When we first got him, he spent a lot of time laying down and now he's standing up all the time, which is a great sign. - Megan Lawrence, Salthaven West

She performed a brief triage before getting him to the Animal Clinic of Regina, where it was confirmed his wing was fractured. Of concern, however, was the severe head trauma he sustained, with a concussion making his recovery touch-and-go. Fortunately, things seem to be looking up.

"Over the last 48 hours, he's made great improvements," Lawrence said. "When we first got him, he spent a lot of time laying down and now he's standing up all the time, which is a great sign."

Recovery journey begins

The young male, whom they've been calling Tahoe, is in for at least a six-week minimum recovery period while his bone heals and stabilizes. Before being released, he will be given test flights to ensure he is strong, healthy and not suffering permanent vision damage as a result of concussion.

But Lawrence says she's cautiously optimistic Tahoe will make a full recovery.

"I think everyone involved made a difference and will definitely contribute towards getting him healthy and back out to the wild."A gunman in suburban Denver opened fire on sheriff's deputies responding to a report of a domestic dispute early Sunday morning, killing one officer and wounding four others while striking two civilians in a barrage of gunfire. The suspect, who was shot and killed, has been identified as 37-year-old Matthew Riehl, CBS Denver reports.

The deputies were called to a residence around 5:20 a.m. Sunday morning where they were immediately met with gunfire from the suspect, Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said in a news conference Sunday.

The two civilians also suffered non-life threatening injuries, Spurlock said. The unidentified suspect, who was killed in the exchange, was known to police but he did not have a criminal history. Spurlock said the suspect wielded a rifle and fired more than 100 rounds in the encounter.

Zackari Parrish, 29, was identified as the deputy killed in the shooting. Parrish joined the force seven months ago. He is survived by his wife and two children. Spurlock said he sat with Parrish's wife and "could see in her eyes that her life was over."

The wounded officers were identified as Mike Doyle, 28; Taylor Davis, 30; Jeffrey Pelle, 32; and Tom O'Donnell, 31.

The FBI office in Denver said it was ready to provide its "full support" to the Douglas County Sheriff's Office.

Footage from the scene showed a heavy police presence, with numerous ambulances and police cars with their lights flashing.

The University of Wyoming confirmed Sunday that Riehl had received a law degree from the school in 2010. UW also said it had been investigating social media posts mentioning the UW College of Law by Riehl.

President Trump offered his condolences to the shooting victims on Sunday. "We love our police and law enforcement -- God Bless them all!" Mr. Trump tweeted.

My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @DCSheriff, and their families. We love our police and law enforcement - God Bless them all! #LESM — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2017

Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colorado) also offered his condolences, saying his "heart breaks for all of those affected" by the tragedy."

Gardner added: "Our law enforcement officers work tirelessly every day to keep our communities safe and today all of Colorado stands with our law enforcement community."Sen. Lindsey Graham says that President Trump should embrace the anti-regime protests currently engulfing Iran and be prepared to go to war with North Korea over the country's nuclear program.

The South Carolina Republican, who has grown closer to Mr. Trump in recent months, told "Face the Nation" guest host Major Garrett on Sunday that the president is doing well when it comes to foreign policy. A noted foreign policy hawk, Graham also said that Mr. Trump should use the opportunity provided by the Iran protests to explain on television why the Iranian nuclear deal is "bad for the world."

"So if I were President Trump, I would have a nationwide address pretty soon explaining why the Iranian nuclear deal is a bad deal for the world, what a better deal would look like, and urge Congress and the European allies to get a better deal with Iran -- before it's too late," Graham said.

When asked if it might be counterproductive for the U.S. to endorse the protests, Graham dismissed that thinking as "the Obama approach."

"If I were Trump, I'd do the exact opposite of Obama," Graham said. "Obama said, 'I don't want to get involved, I don't want mess up the chance of getting a deal with Iran.' Well, the deal with Iran hasn't worked. The money didn't go to benefit the people, it went to benefit the Ayatollah and his henchmen."

When asked by Garrett if he had shared these views with the president personally, Graham responded, "I just did."

Garrett then asked Graham about his recent assertion that, should the North Koreans test another nuclear weapon, the chances of the U.S. attacking that country rise to 70 percent.

"The president has drawn a line in North Korea telling the regime, 'I will never let you hit America with a nuclear-tipped missile. If I have to, I'll use military force to stop you.' Now, the Iranians are watching the way he engages with North Korea, and vice versa. So we've got a chance here to deliver some fatal blows to really bad actors in 2018. But if we blink, God help us all," Graham said.

Asked if this means 2018 "will be the year of preemptive strikes," Graham said it will "be the year to deny North Korea the capability to hit the homeland."Cincinnati Reds' starting pitcher Bronson Arroyo throws during the first inning of a baseball game against the St. Louis Cardinals Saturday, April 8, 2017, in St. Louis.

On March 20, 2006, just a bit more than a week before the start of the regular season, the Cincinnati Reds swung a trade for a lanky right-hander named Bronson Arroyo, sending outfielder Wily Mo Pena to the Boston Red Sox in exchange.

Arroyo was 29 and coming off his second year in the Red Sox rotation. He was known for getting outs without throwing very hard and wearing a notorious set of cornrows in 2004. No one could have predicted the type of run he'd go on for eight years with the Reds – 265 starts, 1,690 1/3 innings and a 4.05 ERA.

Now, Arroyo has walked away from the game. The Enquirer spoke to several teammates, coaches and executives to collect memories about Arroyo's time with the Reds. At the time of year for looking back, here is a look at Arroyo's career with Cincinnati, through the words of those who were there for it.

(Comments have been edited and condensed for clarity.)

First impressions

Dick Williams (current Reds GM): "I started in January of '06. I came down to spring training not really knowing what to expect. I was in that run-down clubhouse in Sarasota. I'm looking around seeing big-league players for the first time, and I see Wily Mo Pena. You're looking up at Wily Mo Pena like, 'Oh my god, this is what a pro athlete looks like.' This mountain of a man. Soon after that, right there are the beginning of spring, Wayne told us, 'I got a deal. We're trading Wily Mo for Bronson Arroyo.'"

Wayne Krivsky (Reds general manager, 2006-08): "It came out of the blue, really. I got a call from (then-Red Sox general manager) Theo Epstein, and they expressed interest in Wily Mo Pena. I said, 'Well, I need starting pitching.' He mentioned Bronson. I was floored."

Williams: "The next day you go downstairs and Wily Mo's gone. By the afternoon, Bronson's there, because he just had to drive over from Ft. Myers. 'This doesn't look like a one-for-one.' I remember thinking that."

Krivsky: "Bronson had just signed a deal with the Red Sox. We had him on a fair contract, I thought. There wasn't a lot of back and forth. A couple phone calls, and let's do it."

David Ross (Reds catcher, 2006-08): "Who was this skinny, longhaired blond kid? We both got over to Cincinnati at the same time. I think he was traded the day before I got over there. We kind of hit it off and both were new. We ended up hanging out and talking to each other."

Rick Stowe (home clubhouse manager): "I remember our security guard was more excited about it, because he was from Boston. He was so excited we got Bronson Arroyo. I was also wondering how we could pick up a starting pitcher for Wily Mo Pena. I think that'll probably go down as one of Theo Epstein's worst trades ever."

Joey Votto (Reds first baseman, 2007-present): "The first time I saw Bronson, it was when he was with the Red Sox and he had his hair braided up. I had braided my hair, I think, before that. So I thought he was a poser and copying my style. I know I was a minor-leaguer, but that kind of stuff can spread like wildfire."

Stowe: "By the end of spring, we knew we had a gold mine there. As far as us in the clubhouse, he treated us unbelievable. A lot of times when guys come in, they'll try to fit in with their teammates first. It's not, 'You know what, I want to fit in with the clubhouse guys here.' It's not like that. He fit in with everybody."

Bronson the pitcher

Arroyo became a big part of the Reds rotation right away, posting a 3.29 ERA in 240 2/3 innings in 2006 and making his only All-Star team. He never quite matched that year again, but could be counted upon like clockwork. He'd take the ball every fifth day, wind up with his high leg kick and give his best effort. Sometimes, he'd confound hitters with his breaking and offspeed pitches and his slower-than-average fastball. Sometimes he'd get shelled.

Votto: "The first time I faced him was spring training, and pitchers were throwing live. He's firing up 82-mile-an-hour meatballs. He's got this L screen in front of him, and he was the only guy throwing with an L screen because he was not excited about getting the ball shot back at him. But he was throwing so slow, and he wasn't throwing any breaking pitches. I remember thinking to myself, 'This is so easy. This is so cake right now.'"

Jonny Gomes (Reds outfielder, 2009-11): "Bronson's got that embarrassing factor. You're going to embarrass your family. It looks like you've never played baseball in your life. You've always got that in the back of your head. 'How can you not hit an 81-mile-an-hour fastball?'"

Bryan Price (Reds pitching coach and then manager, 2010-present): "That was one of the first things I asked him when I got the job here. We were together in spring training, and I said, 'Did you always throw the baseball this way? Were there people there that tried to change you?' He said, 'Number one, yes. I've always thrown the ball this way. Number two, yes. People have tried to change me but I've been able to always throw strikes and always compete and always win.'

Gomes: "It's like going to a gunfight with a BB gun and just plunking everybody off because you're a great shot."

Price: "He'd give up a homer on a particular pitch, and the next time the hitter got up he threw him the exact same pitch. His theory, and he could validate this, was that the hitter's already checked that pitch off and he wouldn't see it rest of the game. For Bronson, it was a free strike. So if he threw a guy a strike curveball and the guy hits it out of the ballpark, he's going, 'That guy's thinking I'm not going to throw him another curveball.' Boom, there it was. First-pitch breaking ball for a strike."

Ross: "The three years I was there, every time I caught him he would lob in the first pitch of the game. He would throw literally an 80 mile-an-hour batting practice fastball right down the middle, and the guys would take it every time. Then the league started to learn that he would do that and he had to start changing it up."

Price: "You ever notice how many breaking pitches or change-ups he threw first pitch of the game? He just wasn't sold that he could pump a first-pitch fastball right down the pipe and the hitter would take it. 'Why would I want to go down 1-0 on the first pitch of the game?' You could darn near guarantee it was going to be a slow curveball or a change-up first pitch of the game."

Ross: "He had his own system for signs. He could tell you what he wanted to do with his eyes. With two strikes, he'd make eye contact and look up. You knew he wanted a high heater. You kind of learn when he wants it, so you knew when to make eye contact with him."

Price: "He just has such great trust in himself and what he sees. He was always very involved in our pre-game discussions about the opposing team. However, I think he saw what he needed to see right in front of him. He could see the approach of the hitter, he could see areas of the plate that were vulnerable based on the speed and shape of a particular pitch. And he was all ears if you had different ideas."

Ross: "He would call a lot of his own pitches. He loved to shake off. I called him the human bobblehead. Sometimes you'd put down the wrong pitch just so he'd shake to the one I wanted."

When Arroyo pitched, two things were consistent – he'd work quickly, and he'd go as deep into the game as possible. In his eight years in Cincinnati prior to his 2017 swan song, he fell short of 200 innings just once, by a single frame.

Votto: "In 2010, I had tickets to Game 7 of the NBA Finals in Los Angeles, to watch the Lakers play the Celtics. We were at home against the Dodgers, but were playing in Seattle the next day, so I was making a pit stop in L.A. At the time, I was a league-minimum player, so the idea of getting your own plane was out of the question. There was a commercial flight somewhere around 4:30 or 5 o'clock range. It was direct from Cincinnati to Los Angeles. The only way that I could have gotten to that game is if the starter had pitched faster than two hours and 45 minutes, and even then I still probably wouldn't have made it. It turns out Bronson, aware of that, pitched a two hour and twenty minute game. I just made it. To this day, I'm still thanking him for that."

Gomes: "There's not many things you can write in pen throughout the season. But there was a nine-year stretch where you could grab the schedule and count every five days and put his name down."

Votto: "There were too many occasions where he probably should not have started, where other players would have passed on it."

Price: "The only year he struggled was 2011. But that was one of the most memorable. He'd pitched six seasons in a row when he'd thrown 200 innings. We got to his last start of the year against the Mets in New York. He had 191 innings. He had gotten sick in spring training. He's already thin. He can't afford to lose a lot of weight. He lost weight and missed time. He never had a lot of energy. He went from averaging 88 to 90 down to 85-86."

Williams: "He pitched eight innings that day. If he'd gotten a nine-inning complete game, he would have gotten his 200. Dusty got him out of there after the eighth. A lot of guys would have made a big deal about it, because Bronson was really proud of that 200-inning streak. But he was cool about it. The game situation dictated that we needed a reliever to come in."

Price: "Throwing 199, considering what he went through that year, was the standout season of all. We didn't have a real good year. We finished four or five games under .500, if I remember correctly. But he remained a constant in our rotation with such a dramatic difference in quality of stuff."

Ross: "He's a one-track mind. He's so good at his craft and how he takes care of his body and the way he prepares. He's so routine-oriented. He knows what he wants to do out there. I learned a lot about game-calling from catching him."

Price: "You could never find a more committed player as far as being prepared to pitch, physically and mentally. He would challenge guys like Mike Leake and Cueto and Latos and say, 'I'm going to outlast you. I'm going to pitch longer than you are, because I'm going to outwork you.' He'd say it tongue-in-cheek and in jest, kind of as a way to prod those guys and make sure they were working."

Walt Jocketty (Reds GM, 2008-16): "He would come in off the road trips sometimes, and even if it was kind of late he would go work out in the weight room at the ballpark. If he didn't get a decent workout during the day, he did it when he got off the plane."

Stowe: "Every day off day, he'd call me up. 'I need to go to the ballpark.' He needs to lift and feel the balls, he says. He'd go out and long toss every day. He'd always need to go in and throw a ball. If he couldn't find a player to go in, it would be myself or my brother who would be on a trip. If something happened and he wasn't able to get to the ballpark, you'd see him out in a parking lot in Miami or something. He'd be in a parking lot throwing against a wall or something."

Bronson the person

On the field, Arroyo was known for his consistency. Off the field, he was a Hall of Famer. He was the stereotypical glue guy, except that there was nothing stereotypical about him. Everyone loved him.

Votto: "He's this really nice hybrid of needs to socialize to be happy, but needs to be himself to be happy."

Price: "There's just a unique quality about him that makes you want to be around him."

Stowe: "He knows everything about everything going on in this clubhouse. He knows every guy."

Ross: "I've never met a more honest guy. He'll shoot you straight. It's not malicious, but it's just the truth."

Stowe: "He would stir my dad (late clubhouse manager Bernie Stowe) up. He come in and go, 'C'mon Bernie, tell me some of them stories! Give me some stories of the old days!' He'd get him riled up every day. I'd be like, 'Bronson, get away from him! Leave him alone!' He had that effect. 'Tell me about Pete! Tell me about Johnny!' He did it every day."

Gomes: "He was like a chameleon. This dude would get down with the country guys, this dude would get down with the hip hop guys. He'd play the bongos with the Latins. He was loved by all."

Stowe: "He never spends money on himself. I'll never forget – this was after 2011 or 2012 – he was living in Mt. Adams in the upstairs of a two-family home. He wanted a bicycle, but he didn't want to pedal up all those hills. So he got a motorized bicycle, and he felt very guilty about buying that motorized bicycle. It was the only thing he purchased for himself in I don't know how long."

Ross: "He is a tightwad."

Zack Cozart (Reds shortstop, 2011-17): "He's very smart with his money."

Ross: Every time I would see him, he was talking about saving money in some shape or form. The only thing he ever splurged on was a nice boat in Cincinnati on the water. That was the nicest thing he had. He had an old Hummer when we were there, an H2 when they were nice. But it was getting out of shape. If he spent money, it was a well thought-out thing."

Cozart: "We talk about money all the time, how you shouldn't spend it crazy. But he goes into big details with stuff like that. He'll talk about the pension. He starts doing these calculations on if you should take it out when you're 45 or when you're 62 and how much over the long run would you really get."

Stowe: "He did take the whole clubhouse staff down to Costa Rica for a week, all expenses paid. I didn't go. Married, with four kids at the time. But the whole clubhouse staff went. He does stuff like that all the time. We're always included. His buddies come in for concerts or something. 'Hey, I'm getting tickets. Who wants to go to the concert?'"

Arroyo also loved to pull pranks.

Price: "The best ones are the ones you don't want to share."

Billy Hatcher (Reds first- and third-base coach, 2006-present): "You can't trust Bronson, and you can't get him because he's not afraid of anything. He lives in Florida and messed with alligators and snakes and everything. You just say, 'That was a good one' and leave it alone. If you try to retaliate, it's going to get worse."

Price: "He was the one that had the fake article written about Billy Hatcher, about being the best third-base coach, and then would spread it around the clubhouse. Inevitably, one would land around the coaches' room and Hatch would read it. It was brilliant."

Votto: "He made a song about me. He made a song about me getting a Lamborghini. 'I'm the MVP and I'm ridin' in my Lambooooo.' I came into the clubhouse one day and the song was playing over the speakers. I was like, 'What is that?' Then I started listening to it and guys would look at me and point and laugh. It was the year I'd won the Most Valuable Player and I bought a Lamborghini. He was just basically putting me in my place and reminding me, 'Hey, you're not immune to our shenanigans.' I still ask him to this day for that song. I want the mp3 of it so I can listen to it in my Ford Focus."

Price: "We have the clubhouse music. Most of us on the coaching staff can't stand the music being played in the clubhouse. I started to moan a little bit about it. 'I think Sunday day games should be staff music day.' Bronson followed up and asked, 'What would you call it?' I said I'd call it the Soft Sounds of the '70s. So he ends up putting together some of the absolute best and worst of the '70s – the pina colada song, something by America, something by Bread. He narrated through all of the songs. Anything that he gets involved in is done in such an intricate way. You can always tell it's a Bronson production."

Stowe: "I do remember a couple pranks that he's pulled. Billy Hatcher has got a little phobia of small people."

Hatcher: "I don't have a phobia."

Stowe: "Bronson knew one of the guys from Big and Rich. He brought him and his brother in, who were both... smaller in stature. He hid them in his locker."

Hatcher: "He told me he was ordering a glove and he had 'El Snatcho' put on it. I come in from throwing batting practice one day, and he says, 'Hatch, I got your glove. It's in my locker. It's right there, get it out.'"

Stowe: "There they are behind all his clothes."

Hatcher: "Two little guys, and I almost s—t myself, is basically what happened. I took off running and they got a laugh out of it. It probably took two or three years off my life."

Stowe: "He got Billy pretty good that day."

Goodbye, hello again, goodbye

After the 2013 season, the Reds and Arroyo parted ways. He'd pitch the next season at 37, and the Reds had younger pitchers on whom to spend their money. Arroyo signed a two-year deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks, but then – for the first time in his career – got hurt. He had Tommy John surgery that June.

Price: "He ended up with a two-year deal with Arizona. I don't think at the time the Reds were able to go down that road, knowing they still had Homer Bailey and Johnny Cueto, younger pitchers with a lengthier future ahead of them. That was an organizational decision. There was no way to get it all."

Jocketty: "We weren't in a position at the time to extend him again. It worked out well for us, because that's when he got hurt, which was really a shock."

Price: "He and I stayed in touch. When he got hurt and realized he was going to have the surgery, and then the shoulder got done after the elbow, I had a really strong feeling that at some point in time he and I were going to come back together. If I was still in Cincinnati, he would at some point come back. I was very confident in that."

Arroyo became a free agent after the 2015 season, but hadn't pitched in a year-and-a-half. He'd turn 39 in February. The Reds thought about a reunion, but the Washington Nationals – and former Reds manager Dusty Baker – jumped first and inked him to a minor-league deal for 2016. Again injured, he barely pitched that season.

Williams: "He'd called me the day he walked off the mound and said, 'I'm done. I'm totally done. Everything hurts.'"

Price: "Washington got him in 2016 before we did. We were in discussions with him, but they made a commitment first. But when that was over, we made a real strong push to get him back in the organization."

Williams: "Last offseason, early in the offseason, he said, 'If I were able to come back and give it one more shot, it would be with you guys.' Bronson basically said, 'Fill out a contract. I'll sign it, whatever you put on there.' It was the easiest contract negotiation I've ever done."

With injuries forcing him into heavy duty, Arroyo made 14 starts for the Reds this year. Few of them were good, and he landed on the disabled list after the last, owner of a 7.35 ERA. He'd taken his shot, and now he knew his ride was over at age 40.

Cozart: "He doesn't want to quit playing baseball. He just knows he physically can't do it."

Price: "If he in any way, shape or form wants to stay in baseball, it would be great if it could be here in Cincinnati. He's impactful in more ways than even he may understand."

Stowe: "I can almost guarantee we'll see Bronson again down the road."

Although I was 99% sure this was a bug in my code, jemalloc has had its fair share of deadlock bugs in the past so I held a glimmer of hope I could find something really interesting.

The tests didn't hang with the system allocator and valgrind saw nothing wrong. So I dug into the code and learned a lot about jemalloc's internals; especially I learned that there's a lot of tricky locking in the thread cache code, which surprises me since the point of the thread cache is to reduce synchronization overhead, but I guess I was looking at all the slow paths. I observed that modifying lg_tcache_max (the largest size-class kept in the thread cache) changed at what point it deadlocked, but not in a predictable way (making a table of values to progress, there was a general trend that the larger the classes allowed, the more progress it made, but not consistently).

One of the interesting things was how predictable the failure was. Thinking I might be doing something to corrupt jemalloc's structures badly enough to corrupt the lock, I scripted gdb to print the state of the lock at the points where it was locked and unlocked in the function where it deadlocks, which revealed that the locks looked fine in that function. Unfortunately, because everything was optimized out, it was hard to introspect the structures I thought might have been getting corrupted; I started building rust with a debug, assertion-laden jemalloc, but I knew it would take all night on my laptop.

Before I called it a night, I scripted gdb to print all the calls to mallocx , rallocx , and sdallocx , and their return values, and started putting together a sed script to transform this into a C program that made the same sequence of allocations and deallocations.

When I woke up the next morning, I realized there was something suspicious about the deallocations logged. I tested with the system allocator, but with various allocators LD_PRELOAD 'd, including the same version of jemalloc that Rust was using; none of these hung. So I asked myself, what's the difference?

Of course, Rust is using the sized deallocation API ( sdallocx ), and the system allocator will be going through malloc and free and not passing any sizes. Looking again at how my library was calling dealloc, I spotted the bug instantly; I was claiming some things I was freeing were smaller than they actually were. Changing this fixed the bug. I took a look through the paths that sdallocx would take if given smaller sizes, and it looks like if my build of Rust with jemalloc assertions enabled had finished compiling, it would have detected my mistake, but otherwise, supplying the wrong size would cause havoc in the thread cache later.

You might say that I should have known to look at these things first, but such is the nature of bugs.A relief worker checks road conditions on a map of Puerto Rico during aid distribution planning in San Juan. Colin Chaperon for the American Red Cross

The year's biggest stories in maps—and a few of the best maps, in stories.

There's no one right way to make sense of a tumultuous year, but at least maps offer one kind of insight: Even in a digitally connected world, geography is still, frequently, destiny. From the effects of DACA elimination, to Hurricane Harvey's impact on Houston, to Uber's wild year, CityLab has reported many of the year's top stories through the lens of physical place. As a special edition of MapLab, CityLab's biweekly maps newsletter (sign up here), I looked at some of 2017's big stories in maps, and some of 2017's best maps, in stories.

Missiles move (KCNA via Reuters) North Korea rang in 2017 by claiming it was making "final preparations" on a missile capable of reaching the U.S. Doubts about the country's technological capabilities remain, but the country did indeed test multiple long-range ballistic missiles (and possibly a hydrogen bomb) this year, as promised. In return, Trump threatened the country with "fire and fury," undermining U.S. diplomatic efforts in the process. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (shown above in an undated photo, apparently measuring distances on a map with officials of the Korean People's Army) replied, "I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire."

Megaregions dawn

(Rae + Nelson)

For all the hand-wringing after the 2016 election, the divides between "urban" and "rural" aren't really so clear-cut. Many planners and economists now argue that the U.S. economy is powered by "megaregions": interlocking workforces in clusters of neighboring cities. To illustrate the point, the researchers Garrett Dash Nelson and Alasdair Rae built an algorithm to measure commuter flows and produced vibrant maps that stitch together towns like San Francisco, San Jose, and Sacramento; and Des Moines, Springfield, and Peoria. Bright lights, bigger cities. Mass shootings accelerate The deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history came in October, when a gunman pent up in a Las Vegas hotel tower showered gunfire on concertgoers across the street, leaving 59 people dead and more than 500 others injured. A month later, a man opened fire on churchgoers in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing 26. There were dozens of smaller-scale events this year. The Gun Violence Archive reports more than 14,000 people were killed and over 29,000 were injured in mass shootings (defined here) in 2017. That might make it the worst year on record. Mass shootings affect communities of all shapes and sizes: CityLab charted that geography here. (The map shown here does not include incidents after October 2.) Cities resist (CityLab Latino/Univision/US Climate Mayors) In June, President Trump announced the U.S. would pull out of the Paris accord. The landmark climate agreement, signed now by literally every other recognized country in the world, established a goal of limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius by cutting carbon emissions. The accord may have never been enough to save the planet from climate disaster, but the U.S. withdrawal left many world citizens concerned about who'd fill the vacuum in leadership. One unlikely leader: an alliance of cities. The mayors of nearly 400 U.S. cities (some of which are mapped above), representing 60 million Americans, signed a commitment to "adopt, honor and uphold" the goals of the Paris agreement. Possible? We'll see. But it was one of the year's most powerful statements of local resistance to federal policy.A protester in Los Angeles after the presidential election in November. Patrick Fallon/Reuters

Across the policy spectrum, cities stepped in as a viable alternative to the agenda of Donald Trump.

Cities resisted Donald Trump immediately. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio became a vocal public opponent. As protesters gathered in airports in response to Trump's original travel ban, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto put himself front and center. And urban communities across the country started organizing themselves—reverse engineering Tea Party tactics to oppose Trump's agenda in Washington. For many cities, the election of Trump was a signal that it was their moment to rise. As the months rolled on, some of that local resistance solidified into policy. From symbolic statements and rallies, new local laws have sprouted up responding to actions coming from the White House, and city initiatives have filled regulatory gap left by this administration. Here are some of the more notable instances of city resistance from the past year. Funding lawyers for their own immigrants: "We're not going to sacrifice a half a million people who live among us" Immigration was the central pillar of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, and he started working on fulfilling his promises from the get go. Starting in January, he issued a series of executive orders that sought to crack down on immigration violations at the border and in the interior of the country. The administration claimed to target only "criminal aliens," but for all intents and purposes, that meant everyone without papers. It also pushed for measures restricting legal immigration and announced the end of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which gave unauthorized immigrants who have been in the country since they were children temporary relief from deportation. But cities had been bracing themselves. "We're not going to sacrifice a half million people who live among us," Mayor Blasio announced back in November 2016. "We will do everything we know how to do to resist that."

In 2017, that pushback took various forms. Foreseeing the expanded dragnet, several cities announced a legal fund for immigrants facing deportation, which has shown to dramatically increase the likelihood of a positive legal outcome. And while some local governments were chomping at the bit to join the crack down, others decided to end agreements with the feds that might require them to become a cog in the deportation machinery. Santa Ana, for example, stopped renting out their jail beds to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). And San Francisco suspended its participation in the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) with the FBI, which deputizes their police officers to do FBI work, including collecting information on immigration status. "It's an unambiguous, clear rejection of the false choice that the Trump Justice Department wanted Chicago to make." San Francisco and Chicago also sued the government, arguing that its repeated threats to pull federal grants from the so-called "sanctuary cities" were unconstitutional. So far, they've been winning. "It's an assertion of our most fundamental American values, and it's an unambiguous, clear rejection of the false choice that the Trump Justice Department wanted Chicago to make between our values, our principles, and our priorities," Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago said in September. Still, officials in Chicago and elsewhere face new challenges in protecting their residents when the data they collect is being shared with a far more anti-immigrant federal government. Mayors to Trump: You don't speak for us on climate It was his most global anti-environmental regulation statement yet. Announcing he would withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord, Donald Trump said: "I was elected to represent Pittsburgh, not Paris." But Pittsburgh's mayor wouldn't let that representation of his city stand. "Pittsburgh stands with the world and will follow the agreement," retorted Peduto. As the Mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy & future. https://t.co/3znXGTcd8C — bill peduto (@billpeduto) June 1, 2017 Within days, hundreds of mayors committed to uphold the Paris agreement themselves. And in a follow-up announcement just last month, some 67 of them and growing signed on to a more formal commitment. They vowed to achieve the emissions reductions by the standards set out in the Paris accord and to collaborate to tackle the international agreement's goals. "Even as Washington fails to act, cities have the power and will to take decisive action to protect our planet and the health and safety of our residents," said Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who hosted the North American Climate Summit.

Executing on this commitment, of course, requires much more than grandstanding. Cities are just starting to grapple with the strategies to hit tough emissions reduction benchmarks, particularly as the EPA rolls back more than 30 regulations and corporations are given a freer reign through the repeal of the Clean Power Plan. And experts have projected that while it would be a tall order for cities to reach the Climate Accord's goals without the federal government, they could get pretty far. When Congress wouldn't act on guns, Columbia, South Carolina did The loss of human life in the U.S. due to mass shootings is staggering, and accelerating. In one mass shooting in Las Vegas alone, the perpetrator wrought mass destruction, killing 58 and injuring more than 500—not only due to the city's lax gun laws, but because the assailant had outfitted his weapon with bump stocks, effectively turning his gun into an assault weapon. Cities are changing fast. Keep up with the CityLab Daily newsletter. The best way to follow issues you care about. Subscribe Loading... Instead of banning assault weapons, bump stocks, or tightening rules for background checks, as lawmakers urged, the Trump administration has continued to profess stalwart support for gun owners. "We just thought this was a perfect opportunity for good guys with guns to do some good policy making." Absent federal action, cities and states have been aggressively implementing regulation of their own. In the wake of Las Vegas' massacre, Massachusetts banned bump stocks at the state level. And in the final weeks of 2017, Columbia, South Carolina—of all places—became the first city to implement local regulations around bump stocks. Despite a South Carolina state law restricting cities from regulating firearms or firearm components, the city council pushed through a law to prohibit their use. Many other mayors from red states have avoided even trying to pass their most aggressive bills for fear of state-level preemption measures, but Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin was undeterred. "We just thought this was a perfect opportunity for good guys with guns to do some good policy making," said Benjamin. Benjamin now hopes other cities will follow his lead—and maybe the federal government: "The hope is, not only does this influence the actions of those who might sell bump stocks but more so it would influence federal policymakers." One of the few federal gun laws that is in place runs background checks for some purchases of guns. But several cities are now alleging that even that law suffers from lax enforcement, saying in a new lawsuit that the Department of Defense failed to flag service members in the background check database who were disqualified from gun ownership. Baltimore takes back its own police reform from Jeff Sessions There was no doubt, many police departments were eagerly awaiting Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions' arrival as chief law enforcers so that the U.S. Department of Justice would stop breathing down their necks. Baltimore's was not one of them.

Not even two months into his tenure as Attorney General, Sessions released a memo declaring that all "consent decree" agreements to implement city police reforms were subject to his review—and his likely cancellation. Baltimore was in the final throes of completing its consent decree to bring major changes to its police department after it was brought to shame by a censorious investigation under President Barack Obama's justice department. It had one more public hearing scheduled to seal the deal, but Sessions attempted to delay that hearing so he could consider canceling the deal altogether. "Those reforms are going to take place no matter what." Baltimore wasn't having it. In one of the rare occasions in which the city's mayor, city council, police chief, and state leadership were in agreement, they successfully rebuffed Sessions' request and moved forward with finalizing the consent decree, which was signed on April 7. "Those reforms are going to take place no matter what," Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said in the Baltimore Sun a few days before. "We have to continue to stress the necessity of constitutional policing in Baltimore." There are many ways this administration tried to impose its will on local police departments in the months since, but Baltimore stood up to the feds (as it has in the past) and showed cities that they don't have to take Sessions' bullying. San Francisco, Chicago, and Spokane preemptively ban Muslim registries Throughout history, sensitive data has been collected and used to target populations deemed threatening. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Census Bureau block-level data helped round up Japanese Americans. And following the 9/11 terrorist attack, then-President George Bush created a sort of "Muslim registry" that President Trump has talked about reviving.

To ensure that locally-collected data does not aid federal moves in this direction—should they ever happen—San Francisco, Chicago, Spokane, and the state of Colorado have passed ordinances prohibiting municipal resources or personnel from being used for any registry based on race, religion, or national origin in March 2017. Some of these also allow residents to sue if they feel the city has violated the policy. "Basically we're saying, 'no registry,'" said San Francisco then-Mayor Ed Lee at the time. Cities have taken other steps to limit federal data-collection, too. The San Francisco Police Department suspended its Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) agreement with the FBI, mentioned above, based on concerns that the task force's wide berth of surveillance powers might be used to monitor Muslim residents. And Oakland passed a law based on an ACLU template to require public vetting of any new surveillance technology acquired by the police. Confederate monuments keep on toppling Donald Trump called confederate monuments "beautiful" and those advocating for their removal "weak, weak people." It was after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in which Trump praised some participants as "very fine people" that cities started to take more of their monuments down. In one of the most dramatic instances of government-led action, the city of Baltimore removed several of their monuments, unannounced, in the middle of the night. Mayor Catherine Pugh, who led the effort, defended her decision to circumvent the administrative process that had stalled other monument removals. "The city charter says, according to our city attorney, if the mayor wants to protect or feels like she needs to protect the public or keep her community safe, she has the right to keep her community safe," she said at a press conference the next day. "I thought that there's enough grandstanding, enough speeches being made, get it done."

Pugh made the decision the day after another grassroots effort toppled a monument in Durham, North Carolina. In that case, the city implicitly supported the protesters by announcing they wouldn't make any arrests. "I thought that there's enough grandstanding, enough speeches being made, get it done." One of the most innovative approaches to getting monuments down occurred just last week when the city of Memphis sold its parks to a nonprofit organization, which promptly removed the monuments. Cities also responded to the Charlottesville rally in another way. More than 270 organizations have signed a compact to implement a joint plan for fighting hate at the local level. "Regardless of leadership in the White House, we have the power to enact meaningful and lasting change at the local level," wrote Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt in CityLab. Cities step in to fill the growing reproductive care gap The war on reproductive health started just three days after President Trump was sworn in, when he expanded the Global Gag Rule limiting foreign countries' activities on abortion. Soon after, his administration signed a bill that is expected to undermine Title X protections, cut the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program two years short, and announced a new rule that allows employers to opt out of birth control coverage in their health insurance plans. "Municipal elected officials have a really important bully pulpit. " Some cities made big strides in filling that gap. Washington D.C. introduced a bill that helps to protect health care professionals who provide or support abortion from discrimination. Pittsburgh passed a law to include abortion coverage in public insurance programs. It also repeals Pennsylvania's ban on abortion coverage sold through private insurance plans. King County, Washington, and Hartford, Connecticut, passed new rules requiring crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs), who masquerade as full service health centers and advise women against getting abortions, to advertise that they are not acting as healthcare facilities. "Our urban centers are the linchpin for healthcare delivery for so many people," Andrea Miller, the president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health, told CityLab earlier this year. "Every city has a budget. Every city makes decisions about how they use their budgetary power. Municipal elected officials have a really important bully pulpit. Standing up not only sends a powerful message, but it's also the beginning of change."walkin.jpeg

The original cast of AMC's "The Walking Dead."

(AMC)

CLEVELAND, Ohio - "The Walking Dead" may be the biggest show in the history of cable television. But it could have just as easily been the biggest show in the history of TV, period.

That's because NBC had first crack at the zombie thriller, but decided to pass. This probably isn't the first time you've heard this story, but NBC's dismissal of "The Walking Dead" re-entered the spotlight over the weekend during a SXSW showcase hosted by The Daily Beast.

The talk focused primarily on the forthcoming "Walking Dead" companion series (or spinoff) set to premiere this summer. However, things got sidetracked when executive producer David Alpert recalled the struggles the show runners had when they approached NBC back in 2005.

"I remember sitting down with the president of NBC at the time and saying, 'You want to put this on your network?' and I held up the book and it has a picture of a zombie with blood all over his face and scared Rick holding a gun," Alpert said during the SXSW talk. "'This is never going to go on NBC.' The exec said, 'No, we're going to do something different and really shake things up!' So we delivered the script exactly the way we said we would, and they passed."

At the time, Frank Darabont (director of "The Shawshank Redemption" and "The Green Mile") had the rights to "The Walking Dead" TV series and produced a pilot with Alpert. According to Alpert, the NBC exec simply said the network couldn't put zombies on TV.

But NBC wasn't the only network to pass. As the story goes, several cable networks turned down a TV adaptation of "The Walking Dead," including HBO. The rejection by HBO is especially surprising, considering the premium cable network thought the concept featured too much violence and gore.

Clearly, HBO changed its mind heading into "Game of Thrones."

"The Walking Dead" eventually found a home on AMC and the rest is, well, TV history.

"Thank goodness we wound up at AMC," makeup artist Greg Nicotero told Huffington Post back in 2012. "They totally get this show. Right from the beginning, they've been completely trusting and supportive of what we've been trying to do with this series."

Does NBC regret its decision? Sort of, but not really.

During a 2013 interview with Entertainment Weekly, NBC entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt called "The Walking Dead" a ratings anomaly. He also said if broadcast networks could put as much effort as AMC does into one show, "it would be the best show you ever saw."

Maybe that's true, or maybe NBC should have just picked up "The Walking Dead."COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Five observations on Ohio State basketball after the Buckeyes beat Miami (Ohio), 72-59, on Saturday.

1. Chris Holtmann saw what was coming on Saturday.

OSU went through some two-a-day practices following the North Carolina loss a week ago. Saturday, Holtmann said after the Buckeyes defeated Miami that he was not thrilled with some of the practices.

The warning signs he saw came true in the second half as Ohio State's 17-point lead was cut down to just three.

"I thought at times, more than at times, they were more physical than we were," Holtmann said. "We've got to answer the bell better than we did today in terms of just playing with more physicality.

"We won the game. Now the challenge is can we learn from some of these things where we have to get better? Because if not, we'll be in for a really, really challenging stretch."

Ohio State went on a 14-2 run early in the second half, which gave the Buckeyes their biggest lead of the night. The Redhawks responded with a 10-0 run to shrink the lead down to seven.

The Buckeyes had problems tracking down Miami's Bam Bowman. He had nine of his 15 points off the bench, all on 3-pointers, when the Redhawks pulled back to within three.

"We just took our foot off the gas pedal," Ohio State guard C.J. Jackson said. "We knew they were a good team and they weren't going to quit.

"We had a, whatever that was, 10, seven-minute lapse. And that kind of cost us."

Another problem the Buckeyes had was a slow start from the field. They made just one of their first nine shots. They went 6:02 without a field goal. The lone offense were three free throws before Keita Bates-Diop ended the field-goal drought.

Bates-Diop led all scorers with 19 points, but was 0-for-6 from 3. He entered the game shooting 42 percent from distance.

"We've got to be able to win a game when a guy like Keita who's so important to us struggles from behind the arc," Holtmann said. "Keita's been so consistent from behind the arc. He had some great looks today.

"He's going to have a night like that. We've got to be able to play through that."

Bates-Diop added a game-high nine rebounds and five blocks.

2. Jackson had 16 points and six assists, and was 4-for-6 from 3. But his most important contribution came in a 65-second stretch.

After the Redhawks cut Ohio State's lead to just three, Jackson answered with a 3 on the next possession. He missed a layup, and despite hobbling after the miss, got back on defense and drew a charge from Miami's Dalonte Brown. Next possession, Jackson found Kam Williams open for a 3, stretching the Buckeyes' lead back to nine.

That sequence began a 10-0 run to put the game away.

"We work on that drill every day, 5-plus-4 transition defense. So I had to kind of sprint back into the weakside," Jackson said. "I knew they were already on a run. They were feeling good. So we needed every stop we could get. At that point, I was trying to get a stop."

3. Kaleb Wesson had a difficult time getting anything going from the field. Ohio State's starting freshman center went just 1-for-7 from the floor.

Several times when he got the ball, Miami crowded the paint and didn't give him much room to make things happen for himself. He finished with seven points and seven rebounds, and was solid defensively as well. But what happened on Saturday was part of a message Holtmann gave to his young big man after the game.

"I think we need more from Kaleb. But he's a freshman, and I think you have moments like this," Holtmann said. "The other thing I told him is, 'Get used to playing in crowds,' because that's going to be what he's going to have to play in moving forward for the next couple of years.

Wesson got to the line several times and was 5-for-5 from the stripe. Holtmann also complimented his ability to pass the ball, something he will need to do more often when the paint is compacted like it was.

4. Jae'Sean Tate nearly missed Saturday's game. He suffered a left shoulder sprain on Thursday, and Holtmann did not know until about 40 minutes prior to tip-off that he was going to have his senior forward in the lineup.

Tate did not practice much on Friday, and Holtmann was concerned with Tate's conditioning.

"I don't know right now if he's in good enough shape to play as hard as we need him to play, to be quite honest. It happens to anybody who's off and then getting back," Holtmann said. "But he's had more days off and he's got to get in better shape."

Tate finished with 11 points and five rebounds in 28 minutes.

He was the first player to be subbed out when Andre Wesson entered after just more than three minutes. Tate got the last basket of the game for Ohio State on a baseline drive that ended with a two-handed dunk.

5. Despite Holtmann's disappointment about the lost 17-point lead in the second half, he was pleased by the team's performance at the end of the nonconference schedule.

The only significant blemish was the overtime loss to Butler at the PK80 Invitational when Ohio State gave up a 15-point second-half lead. Other than that, the Buckeyes' losses came to the two teams from last year's national championship game and a Clemson team that has just one loss.

"It was not an easy nonconference. And that's a good thing," Holtmann said. "To be 9-4 through it, I feel good about it. I think our guys feel good about it."

It's all Big Ten games now, starting with a trip to Iowa on Thursday. Four of the next six games are on the road, and Ohio State's next two home games are against No. 2 Michigan State and Maryland.

"We just focus on Big Ten. We can't really be looking back on what we did previously. We've just got to keep moving forward," guard Kam Williams said.COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Maybe it was the overnight snow. Maybe it was the noon start.

But whatever the reason, Ohio State had problems putting away Miami (Ohio) when they met on Saturday at Value City Arena.

A 14-2 run early in the second half didn't do the job on its own. But the Buckeyes finally claimed a 72-59 victory over the Redhawks, thanks to a 10-0 run.

Ohio State (11-4) led by as much as 17. But Miami (7-6) cut the deficit down to three with 6:03 left.

Keita Bates-Diop led all scorers with 19 points, nine rebounds and five blocks. C.J. Jackson added 16 points and six assists, and was 4-for-6 from 3. He hit a 3, then assisted on one to Kam Williams, who had 15, to help spark the 10-0 run.

Both teams shot the ball poorly at the start. Ohio State made just one of its first nine attempts from the floor. Both teams started 2-for-12.

Ohio State overcame a poor shooting start by getting to the free-throw line early and often, finishing 18-23 from there.

Jae'Sean Tate started, but was a game-time decision after suffering a left shoulder sprain in practice on Thursday. He finished with 11 points and five rebounds.

Darrian Ringo led Miami with 16 points, and Bam Bowman came off the bench to add 15.

When it was over

Miami cut the deficit to just three before Jackson hit a 3 with 5:34 to go. He drew an offensive foul and then fed Kam Williams in the corner for a 3, stretching Ohio State's lead out to nine.

It eventually became a 10-0 run, which helped the Buckeyes put away the Redhawks.

What it means

The game was a lot closer than the 13-point margin. But after having a five-game winning streak snapped vs. North Carolina on Dec. 23, Ohio State needed to get a win and some momentum going heading back into Big Ten play.

What's next

Ohio State starts a stretch where it plays four of its next six games on the road. The Buckeyes head to Iowa on Thursday at 7 p.m. ESPNU will broadcast the game.HOUSTON - A man has been arrested on multiple charges after police located a small arsenal of guns on the top floor of the Hyatt Regency on Louisiana Street downtown, Houston police said.

He has been identified as 49-year-old Russell Lawrence Ziemba.

Police at the hotel called for backup around 1:30 a.m. Sunday after they attempted to arrest Ziemba for being intoxicated and trespassing. When help arrived, police noticed ammunition lying around the man's hotel room, Lt. Gordon Macintosh with Houston police said.

KPRC

He was arrested for unlawfully carrying a weapon and trespassing. When investigators looked into his room further, they located an AR-15, a shotgun, a handgun and lots of ammunition, Macintosh said.

Ziemba was extremely depressed and intoxicated when he was arrested, NBC News reported, citing several senior law enforcement officials.

NBC added that the man allegedly told officers that he loves the U.S., is an Army veteran, and did not intend to harm anyone.

Just hours before he was arrested, Ziemba spoke to his next door neighbor, Gabino Ramirez, telling him he was going out of town.

"He was just normal you know. He asked me if he could put his grill inside my garage to keep it out of the weather", Ramirez told Channel 2 News.

Another neighbor said Ziemba would come over to his house often, that Ziemba was usually drunk at the time and that Ziemba caime to his house several days ago and was trying to get into his home.

"He knocked at the door. He tried to open the door. He just kept seeing if it was open. And he came by like 2 or 3 times that night at one in the morning until he finally gave up," Devante Lacy said.

The Hyatt is preparing its own New Year's Eve celebration at the hotel with a 50,000-balloon drop at the stroke of midnight, its website said.

Ziemba's white Chevrolet Silverado was located and towed to be searched and examined, Macintosh said.

Ziemba told police he was at the hotel to celebrate New Year's and admitted to drinking for a few days, Houston police said.

Ziemba told investigators that he brought the weapons because he didn't want them to be stolen from his vehicle parked in the garage.

Houston investigators said they don't believe there was any intent to use the weapons at all.

Police said Ziemba is facing trespassing charges even though he was a hotel guest. He was asked to leave repeatedly and did not comply.

He also faces a charge of assault of a peace officer because of the struggle with the officer.

Copyright 2017 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.(CNN) The largest public display of discontent in Iran since the 2009 Green Movement has resulted in 21 deaths and 450 arrests, restricted access to social media apps and brought pushback from the Iranian government. Such scenes might have been unfathomable a decade ago -- but these new protests, challenging the rule of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, represent discontent rarely seen in Iran.

CNN spoke with experts about the ongoing unrest in the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Why is this happening?

The protests, which began Thursday night , are a reaction to Iran's sputtering economy, rampant corruption and rising fuel and food prices.

But something larger seems to be at play.

Iranians are angry, experts say, because they expected life to get better when severe sanctions were lifted after the deal in 2015 between the P5+1 and Iran over its nuclear program. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council -- the United States, the UK, Russia, China and France -- and Germany make up the P5+1.

Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, and other experts say endemic economic mismanagement and corruption have left Iranians disenchanted.

Government policies have brought about higher unemployment and inflation. And there's a lack of sturdy international investment, Parsi added.

"The nuclear deal is overwhelmingly supported by the Iranian public, but there was an expectation that much more economic development would come out of it," Parsi said.

Is this just about bread and gas prices?

No. Years of political, economic and social grievances have driven some Iranians into the streets in the largest protests since 2009, said Reza Marashi, research director for the National Iranian American Council.

"Economic sanctions have exacerbated all of those Iranian-origin economic problems," he said.

"I don't think you can separate the economic from the political," he told CNN. "The government has an opportunity and a responsibility to address legitimate grievances that are being expressed."

Alireza Nader, a senior international analyst and Iran researcher at the Rand Corp. in Washington, said people have also lost trust in Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.

"The government is viewed as highly corrupt, increasing inequality is seen by the population as really a form of injustice," he said, adding "this was supposed to be a system that delivered justice to the people after the revolution of 1979 and it has failed."

Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said there's also a push to secure equal rights for women.

Nader said women in Iran have been fighting for decades for equal rights, but especially in the last few years, such efforts have become stronger.

"Women in Iran are highly educated. They are involved in the workforce, arguably more so than any other country in the Middle East, and they are continually suppressed. This is part of their fight to gain their freedom and their rights," he said.

An Iranian vice president said Saturday the government would work harder to resolve economic hardships.

Are these protests similar to those in 2009?

The new protests are intense, but so far they are nowhere as big as those in the Green Movement in which millions took part after accusations of widespread election fraud in 2009.

The National Iranian American Council's Marashi said today's demonstrations may be more of a civil rights movement than a revolutionary one.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei

There are other important distinctions. While the earlier protests primarily were in Tehran, had specific goals and an organized hierarchy of leadership, the current ones seem to challenge the rule of the Supreme Leader directly and have been seen across the country.

The exact origins of the protests are hard to pinpoint, but religious hardliners opposed to what they see as Rouhani's moderation are thought to have started them in Qom and Mashhad. They quickly spread to a wider section of the population focused on airing their economic grievances -- and more notably -- their dissatisfaction against Khamenei's rule.

"This is something that didn't happen in 2009. This is a huge thing to happen in Iran," said Nic Robertson, CNN's international diplomatic editor. "People don't say that publicly on the streets."

One resident told CNN of witnessing a protester tearing down a poster of Khamenei near Tehran University.

In his first remarks since the protests began, Khamenei on Tuesday accused Iran's enemies of "joining forces" and blamed them for inciting the protests.

Who are the protesters?

Many of the demonstrators are young Iranians fed up with the lack of economic opportunity.

The International Monetary Fund has called Iranian women an "untapped source of growth and productivity." Iran's unemployment rate among those 15 to 29 is well over 24%, according to official statistics -- and even higher among urban youth and women.The International Monetary Fund has called Iranian women an "untapped source of growth and productivity."

The protestors likely include some disillusioned Rouhani supporters, but they probably don't make up the bulk of the demonstrators, according to Parsi. Seven months ago, Rouhani won re-election with 57% of the vote (and 70% voter participation).

It's likely these protesters are people that typically stay away from traditional politics. Uncompromisingly anti-regime slogans suggest these demonstrators may belong to those who tend not to vote, don't believe the system can be reformed and either never subscribed to or have lost hope in gradual change, Parsi adds.

Other protesters are thought to include those who feel sidelined by economic desperation and humiliation.

How have global leaders responded?

President Donald Trump has been fiercely critical of the Iranian regime, prompting a tit for tat between him and Iranian leaders.

On Friday, Trump first tweeted, "The world is watching!" and that "oppressive regimes cannot endure forever." Trump said that Iran's leadership is squandering wealth to fund terrorism elsewhere.

On Monday, Rouhani said Trump has no right to sympathize with Iran because he has called the Iranian people "terrorists," according to Iran's semiofficial Tasnim News Agency. And on Sunday, state television broadcast Rouhani saying that Trump is "constantly creating problems" for Iranians, including with regard to visas and financial issues.

Khamenei blamed Iran's "enemies" for stirring up unrest in the country, though he didn't mention Trump by name, while the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, accused the United States, UK and Saudi Arabia of using hashtags and social media campaigns inside Iran to incite riots.

British Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said Tuesday that the UK has called on Iran to engage in a "meaningful debate" on the issues the demonstrators have raised.

So what's the most helpful reaction?

Iranian-American analyst Holly Dagres said the best thing for the rest of the world to do is wait and see what happens next in Iran, where protesters have been heard on videos on social media chanting "Death to Rouhani."

"The fact that we are actually making statements that we think are in favor of the Iranian people, they are hurting them more than anything," she said.

Experts say that Trump's tweets are not helpful and that the world should show solidarity with the Iranian people by supporting freedom of expression.

Marashi said the protest movement "is of an Iranian origin and it will be of an Iranian ending."

Parsi said the protests are not a US issue. "This is not about Trump, and Trump stepping into this is not necessarily helpful, because he doesn't carry any credibility in Iran."

Comments against the Iranian regime may not only be unhelpful -- they may bring about a pretext for crackdowns, said Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said the Iranian people gave no credence to "opportunistic" remarks by Trump or his administration.

How is the story getting out?

As was the case in 2009, images and messages from citizen journalists are coming out via social media. Iranian authorities have restricted Instagram and Telegram, but users are accessing them with virtual private networks, or VPNs. The government controls the media and does not allow freedom of speech.

A 2009 New York gathering remembers Neda Agha-Soltan.

Without press access, the world is seeing what may be a skewed version of what's happening. "Independent verification of facts (is) hard to come by," CNN's Robertson said.

But images often are powerful.

In 2009, a video showing the last moments of protester Neda Agha-Soltan catapulted her into a symbol of the burgeoning reform movement in Iran. "That had a chilling impact on the protests in Iran, and it had a chilling impact around the world," Robertson said.

What's coming next?

The Green Movement lasted for months; this round of protests is less than a week old. It's unclear just how much dissent the government will allow.

Iran's Intelligence Ministry says so-called provocateurs will be targeted if anti-government protesters return to the streets.

In 1979 Iranians experienced a revolution without democracy; today they aspire for democracy without a revolution — Karim Sadjadpour (@ksadjadpour) December 29, 2017

"In 1979, Iranians experienced a revolution without democracy; today they aspire for democracy without a revolution," Sadjadpour said.

He said he believes a young Iranian society is seeking a more liberal, progressive nation but is unlikely to take up arms. Iranians are up against a government they know is willing to use force to keep power, he said.

"Despite the fact that many Iranians would have revolutionary ends, I don't think they are willing to pursue revolutionary means en masse the same way, for example, Syrians or Egyptians or others have over the last past five years in the Middle East."

But Sadjadpour also said that even if the protests are squashed -- as he expects -- it's not the end of dissatisfaction.

"The resentment toward the regime will remain and will eventually resurface in the future."Story highlights Bernstein said White House aides have told him Trump has repeatedly expressed a desire to fire Mueller

He and his partner of Watergate reporting fame, Bob Woodward, drew parallels between Trump and Nixon

Washington (CNN) Veteran journalist Carl Bernstein said Sunday that President Donald Trump's lawyers are telling him what he wants to hear about the probe ending soon to prevent Trump from firing Mueller.

"There are many times he has expressed, I'm told by people in the White House, the desire to fire Mueller, the desire to pardon people under investigation including his family," Bernstein, a CNN contributor, told CNN's Dana Bash on "State of the Union." "His lawyers are telling him what he wants to hear -- that's what I'm told -- by lawyers in the White House, they're telling him what he wants to hear to keep him from acting precipitously and to go off and fire Mueller in a rage, or fire (Deputy Attorney General) Rod Rosenstein in a rage. They have an out-of-control client."

Bernstein added: "The President of the United States, in their view, is out of control most of the time, in their view, when it comes to this investigation."

Bernstein's partner of Watergate reporting fame, The Washington Posts' Bob Woodward, appeared alongside him on the program, telling Bash he expects Mueller to leave no stone unturned in the investigation.

"Mueller is going to do this job," Woodward said. "I think some of the Trump lawyers are fantasizing when they think it's going to be over quickly. There is no reason the Mueller operation is going to close up; they're going to want to be thorough."

Read More(CNN) — Can't travel to Times Square on New Year's Eve? Worry not! Chances are, there's a folksier New Year's Eve celebration that's probably closer to your home.

Communities across the USA ring in each year with local (and awesomely quirky) variations on Times Square's Ball Drop, along with plenty of other things to do.

Celebrating bologna, pickles and muskrats might be a far cry from watching the Waterford crystal ball in Times Square with a million of your closest friends. But smaller celebrations reflect local traditions and civic pride. Plus, you'll have an easier time finding the bathroom.

Here are 17 destinations with fun New Year's Eve drops:

1. Mobile, Alabama: MoonPie drop

MoonPies -- a marshmallow, graham cracker and chocolate coating treat -- are popular across the South. So it makes sense a Southern city wants to give it a drop. In comes Mobile along Alabama's Gulf Coast.

Along with watching a giant, 600-pound electric MoonPie drop , some 50,000 folks gather for a laser show, fireworks and beer garden.

For New Year's Eve 2017, George Clinton is the headline act.

2. Flagstaff, Arizona: Pine cone drop

In Flagstaff, Arizona, revelers fill the streets to watch a 6-foot, lighted aluminum-and-copper pine cone be lowered from the roof of the historic Weatherford Hotel downtown.

Organizers chose a pine cone to represent Flagstaff's mountainous locale amid the largest contiguous Ponderosa pine forest in North America.

Begun in 1999, the event includes two pine cone drops : one at 10 p.m. to coincide with New York's Times Square celebration and another at midnight to mark Arizona's big moment.

Organizers tell people to be sure to dress warmly. Flagstaff tends to be very cold on a winter's night.

3. Fayetteville, Arkansas: Hog drop

They're hog wild for New Year's Eve in Fayetteville, located in picturesque northwest Arkansas. Naturally, the home of the Arkansas Razorbacks would gravitate toward a hog drop to go along with the fireworks.

Officially called Last Night Fayetteville, the party also features a variety of musicians, actors and comedians in different indoor venues and around the downtown square. If you're driving from out of town, parking is free, and they promise the shows go on -- rain, snow or shine.

4. Temecula Valley, California: Grape drop

A cluster of grapes seemed the appropriate centerpiece for a New Year's celebration in Southern California wine country.

Temecula Valley's grape drop features a "custom-crafted, illuminated cluster of grapes [that] descend 65 feet from the third-story patio of the beautiful Civic Center clock tower."

Partygoers begin to gather at nightfall for live music, before the grapes descend with both an East Coast and West Coast countdown.

5. Key West, Florida: Four drops!

ROB O'NEAL/The Citizen

Leave it to Key West to come up with multiple, eccentric drops

One: Red high heel drop

"Sushi" descends in a giant red high heel shoe from the balcony of the New Orleans House. VIP balcony tickets usually sell out fast, and Duval Street is jammed with people who party into the wee hours.

Two: Lowering of the pirate wench

Visit the tall ship America 2.0 at Schooner Wharf and brace for cannon blasts that herald the new year. You can watch the pirate wench be lowered from the top of the ship while listening to live music and enjoying the scene at Schooner Wharf Bar.

Three: Conch shell drop

The conch shell is an enduring symbol of Key West, and this drop happens above Sloppy Joe's, probably the most famous bar in Key West. Thousands gather to enjoy this annual tradition. If you're not big on crowds, avoid this one.

Four: Chive unicorn drop

Head to The Porch (on Caroline Street not far from the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum), where they'll be dropping a chive unicorn at midnight. They promise "multitudes of tomfoolery throughout the evening."

6. Panama City Beach, Florida: Beach ball drop

Party central of the Florida Panhandle has two countdowns

The first one is at 8 p.m. for the younger crowd, in which 10,000 inflatable beach balls are dropped from overhead, followed by fireworks. The second one is the midnight countdown, which involves an 800-pound LED-lit beach ball being lowered for the countdown to the new year, followed by more fireworks.

Both take place at Panama City Beach's Pier Park, and musical acts are lined up.

7. Boise, Idaho: Potato drop

Idaho welcomes "SpecTaters" (their words, not ours) to the capitol building in Boise for its annual potato drop

In addition to the fireworks and potato drop (the slogan is #DropItLikeItsHot), revelers can enjoy wrestling matches, an ice sculpture show, snow park, live music and a dance floor. And there's plenty of food and drink vendors on hand.

8. Vincennes, Indiana: Watermelon drop

Folks in Vincennes, Indiana, celebrate New Year's Eve -- and their locally renowned melons -- with a watermelon drop

But instead of slowly lowering a glittering sculpture of a melon (boring!), they drop a bunch of actual watermelons that plummet toward the ground and burst open upon a raised wooden "splatform."

You can also catch live music in a heated tent in this southwestern Indiana town on the shores of the Wabash River across from Illinois.

9. Hagerstown, Maryland: Donut drop

mark youngblood

Krumpe's Do-nuts is a local institution in Hagerstown, Maryland, known and loved for its sweet treats since 1934.

Its classic glazed variety is the focal point of Hagerstown's family-friendly New Year's Eve celebration , which started in 2013.

Festivities begin at 5 p.m. with free doughnuts and hot chocolate and end at 7 p.m. with the 6-foot, 300-pound replica descending down the Hagerstown clock tower.

10. Princess Anne, Maryland: Muskrat 'dive' in

The muskrat has been trapped for pelts and meat for generations in the Chesapeake Bay region, making it a prime candidate for New Year's Eve mascot. Unlike in other events that use replicas, Marshall Muskrat is the real deal: a stuffed muskrat in top hat and cape.

When the Midnight Muskrat Dive started in 2012, Marshall was lowered in a bucket truck. Now, he slides down a zip line for maximum visibility and audience entertainment.

Have a taste for Maryland oysters? They'll be serving them.

11. Chile drop in Las Cruces, New Mexico

The Las Cruces Chile Drop debuted on December 31, 2014, as an homage to chili growers in the region and New Mexico.

When the big chili returns this year, a crane will drop it like it's hot above Las Cruces' Main Street in the center of town. Also on tap in this southern New Mexico city: Dancing, music, food and a beer garden.

12. Mount Olive, North Carolina: Pickle drop in

Dia Solas Images

Thousands of revelers pack this eastern North Carolina town each December 31 to watch the Mt. Olive Pickle Company celebrate the new year by dropping a 3-foot glowing pickle down a flagpole into a pickle tank.

The event happens outside company headquarters at Cucumber Boulevard and Vine Street (there are also Dill and Relish streets nearby). And good news, sleepyheads: The pickle drop occurs not at the stroke of midnight but at 7 p.m. ET -- that's midnight Greenwich Mean Time -- letting kids and early-to-bed adults join in the fun.

There's also a canned food drive to help feed hungry neighbors.

13. Port Clinton, Ohio: Walleye drop

WPCR

Along the Ohio shoreline of Lake Erie, Port Clinton reels in the New Year with a 20-foot, 600-pound Fiberglas fish modeled after the town mascot, Wylie the Walleye.

Since 1996, residents of the self-proclaimed Walleye Capital of the World have braved freezing temperatures for Walleye Madness at Midnight . Festivities begin in the afternoon and culminate in the lowering of Wylie before midnight, followed by fireworks.

14. Lebanon, Pennsylvania: Bologna drop

Courtesy of Jim Zengerle

Residents of Lebanon, Pennsylvania , ring in the New Year by cheering on a massive cylinder of sandwich meat. After all, it's a longstanding point of pride in the region that bologna made in Lebanon is not your average Oscar Mayer fare.

The butchering, curing and sausage-making processes that distinguish Lebanon bologna from "minced bologna" is the stuff of lengthy academic papers

Suffice to say, it's enough to make the town's signature export worthy of New Year's Eve reverence.

15. Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania: Wrench drop

Mechanicsburg Chamber of Commerce

The result of an Eagle Scout project by a Mechanicsburg Area School District graduate, this small town west of Harrisburg dropped its first wrench on New Year's Eve in 2004.

The galvanized steel wrench commemorates the mechanics who settled in the area to repair wagons that were traveling west after crossing the Susquehanna River.

This is true tool time: You can buy replica wrenches during the festivities.

16. Folly Beach, South Carolina: Flip flop drop

Since New Year's Eve 2011, an oversized pair of brightly lit flip-flops has been dropped in Folly Beach, near Charleston, in honor of the coastal community's signature footwear.

Center Street closes to vehicle traffic at 10 p.m., and revelers are welcome to move into the street. The flip-flops drop to count down the last 10 seconds before the New Year followed by a fireworks display.

17. Plymouth, Wisconsin: Big cheese drop

Terps make major waves in the world. And it's no surprise considering this top research university ranks in the top 25 for computer science, criminology, econimics, engineering, information studies, information systems, mathematics, physics, public health, public policy and sociology. But what makes the University of Maryland exceptional isn't the rankings—it's the professors. Incredible professors and world-class learning institutions go hand-in-hand. While taking one of these 10 UMD professors, you'll wake up excited for class—even at 8 a.m.

Check out these 10 awesome UMD professors that inspire students every day.

1. Nelson Padua-Perez – Computer Science

What's better than office hours? Coffee hours. Professor Nelson Padua-Perez hosts "Coffee Hours with Nelson," for his students in his introductory computer science courses CMSC131, 132, 216 and more. Students can meet with Padua-Perez over a cup of Joe and ask him questions about the material. He even sponsors the CS Latino Group. Did someone say free salsa dancing classes? Most professors in 200-person classes seem distant from students, but Padua-Perez makes a point to interact more personally with his students. "I try to talk to the students as if they were my peers. I try to show them respect and I think that works," said Padua-Perez. "I try to keep a good environment in lectures, say a joke when I can, things like that."

2. Justine Madoo – Criminal Justice

Criminal Justice Professor Madoo goes above and beyond to connect students with industry professionals. "She has guest speakers come to class that are in the criminal justice realm which makes the class more interesting and gives lecture some variety," said sophomore Bry Goncalves. Madoo invites police officers, FBI agents, U.S. Marshals, judges and defense attorneys to speak and interact. She wants her students to see the real-life application of each lesson. She truly keeps her teaching style personable. "She related to her students, made jokes and talked about her research within juvenile delinquency often which I found fascinating," said sophomore Jessica Berman. Ready to sign up? You'll find Professor Madoo teaching Introduction to Criminal Justice, Juvenile Delinquency, Corrections, Offender Reentry and Gangs classes. And you can check out her book, Positive and Negative Social Capital: A Balancing Act?

3. John Kim – Academic Writing

When it comes to writing, practice makes perfect. Especially with Professor Kim who teaches Academic Writing for College Park Scholars students. The writing techniques he covers, like quote integration and introducting sources, help his students take their writing to the next level. He asks his students to implement each skill into their assignments, transforming lessons into action. "He always gave helpful feedback on essays and I think that some other professors are too lazy to do that since they have a lot of students," said sophomore Kara Matthews. "But he took the time to explain whatever he took off [points] for. He also stressed peer-reviews, so there was a lot of editing going on and I thought that was helpful." Writing can feel like a struggle at times but Kim's dry humor keeps students entertained and ready for the challenge.

4. Jie Zhang – Marketing

Survey says: Taking classes with Professor Jie Zhang is a no-brainer. Zhang, professor of marketing and the Harvey Sanders Fellow of Retail Management at UMD, strives to make her students understand marketing concepts. "A good quality of an effective teacher is that you're supposed to be able make complex, difficult concepts or techniques or frameworks easier to understand than the other way around," Zhang said. "So I try to break down things into individual pieces that are much easier for students to process and that are easier to relate to." Plus, Zhang provides all the info necessary to excel on her exams. Her straight-forward teaching style lets students ditch the textbook entirely and focus soley on her lectures and PowerPoint slides. Yes, she's that good.

5. Kevin Calabro – Engineering

Goodbye stuffy "professor" titles in Calabro's engineering classes. He wants his students to call him Kevin. And students feel comfortable going to office hours because of Kevin's approachable teaching style. "I think it's helpful that I've taught so many interrelated courses and so I understand what students should have learned in prior courses and what they are going to learn in follow-on courses," Calabro said. "This helps to make students understand what they are learning and why and how this connects to their growing body of knowledge within engineering." That nightmare where you walk into your first day of class to an exam on your prerequisite course won't come true in Kevin's course. He posts his class slides on Elms-Canvas before the lecture so you can review ahead of time and come prepared with questions.

6. Elisabeth Maring – Global Public Health

Help families abroad in Peru, Ethiopia and more with Professor Maring. An advisor for Public Health Without Borders, Maring also directs the UMD College Park Scholars Program. Bright freshmen and sophomores lucky enough to land a spot in the program study together with Maring. Her studies and classes focus on global public health and family dynamics. Junior Rohini Nambiar said, "All of the global public health scholars had to take her class together so we all formed a bond with her. She was always so open for office hours and always wanted to learn more about our lives." She knows the key to understanding family dynamics is relating it to real experiences so she uses her own family to provide examples for class concepts.

7. Professor David Straney – Biology

Tea and cookies, anyone? Professor David Straney knows students need food to function. He brings snacks to exam review sessions and even to early morning final exams. Straney teaches Principles of Genetics and Molecular Genetics Laboratory. Students can't deny that his exams are tricky. But he goes to great lengths to provide them with the necessary resources they need to succeed. "He gave us outlines to every chapter and reading guides for the questions and info we needed to know," said junior Stephanie Arnouk. Plus he holds extra weekly review sessions for students struggling to understand concepts and practice problems. "I've never seen a professor put so much time, love and effort into a class," added Arnouk.

8. Jonathan William England – African American Studies

Professor Jonathan William England turns class into a collaboration. He wants to get to know his students—their opinions, their interests and even their schedules. Due dates aren't set in stone from day one. "He is really flexible and asked about our input on deadlines and due dates," said junior Rachel Kim. "I was never big on history but I loved going to class. He even made the final enjoyable and would crack jokes during it." Professor England teaches Intro to African American Studies, Special Topics in African American Studies and Special Topics in Black Culture. He also makes an effort to connect with his students, making classes interesting by balancing his teaching with personal anecdotes and funny stories.

9. Lenea Stocker – Organic Chemistry

Professor Lenea Stocker breaks down tough chemical reactions into lectures students understand. She goes above and beyond to make sure her students grasp the material. How? Her one-on-one teaching in office hours to help make those Gringard reactions finally click. Stocker also takes the time to answer student questions instead of rushing through PowerPoint lectures. "Her exam questions are very closely related to homework practice problems, so it encourages you to practice," said senior Yonathan Daniel. "She tries to make sure you understand mechanism problems and she puts memes on the front of her exams." Don't be afraid to take up Stocker on her office hours—it's your key to excelling in organic chemistry classes.

10. Katarina Keane – History

Step into the past with Professor Keane. Whether you take Pocketbook Politics or American History, you'll feel engaged with Keane's exciting lectures as well as speech clips and documentaries. Professor Keane is the Executive Director of the Center of Global Migration Studies, a center dedicated to studying immigration and migration. She also lectures within the Department of History at UMD. Students love Professor Keane because she takes the time to personally measure student achievement. "We had a debate in our discussion that she came to and personally graded," said senior Kristina London. "I think she truly sees how much effort you put in and grades fairly." And when you walk into Keane's exam, you won't stress that she'll surprise you with random questions. She prepares her students extremely well before exams.

This post is sponsored by Off Campus Parking.The scattered urban protests that began in Mashhad on Thursday spread to several other provincial cities on Friday, including Qom, Rasht, Kerman, and Qazvin. This is like protests in the US starting in Boston and spreading to Denver and Cleveland.

Predictably, Trump had to get involved, tweeting an objection to the government's arrest of protesters. Jeff Sessions had people arrested for laughing in protest at him. If people in Iran think Trump is behind this movement, that would kill it right there.

One thing I have to complain about in the US press coverage is people saying protests in Iran are rare because it is a totalitarian state. Actually small protests about economic issues are pretty normal from time to time and here and there. There have been lots of protest movements with a political overtone, as well. Something like summer of 2009, when there were really big rallies in the big cities that lasted for months—now, that is rare. It remains to be seen whether this wave of protests is all that important.

It seems clear that the rallies began with complaints against Iran's bad economy. People are complaining about inflation, high prices, and the reduction or removal of government subsidies.

That economic focus of the protests is a little ironic. Iran is back up to exporting 2.5 million barrels a day of petroleum. President Obama's severe sanctions before the nuclear deal in summer, 2015, had involved twisting the arms of countries like South Korea not to buy Iranian petroleum, and had reduced exports to 1.5 mn barrels per day. Moreover, today the price of petroleum is roughly $60 per barrel, which is way up from last summer. In short, Iran should have had a lot of money coming in during the past couple of months.

But at the level of the ordinary person who doesn't directly share in oil wealth, there was a loss of real income during the Obama sanctions and people haven't recovered. Moreover, since the GOP Congress and Trump are trying to destroy the nuclear deal, they have declined to lift US unilateral sanctions on Iran, and implicitly threaten European corporations who plan to invest in Iran with US Treasury Department sanctions. So the gold rush of investment that Rouhani promised the public to come as a result of the nuclear deal has not materialized to the extent that Iran wanted. And lack of foreign investment has hurt job growth.

In addition, a problem with rentier states like Iran, which depend on one or two pricey primary commodities, is that it is hard to get the money into people's hands, even where government bureaucrats aren't hopelessly corrupt and keep it for themselves. If you just give the money out it causes inflation by increasing the money supply in the absence of any rise in productivity, i.e. any increase in goods produced per person per hour. Inflation is too much money chasing too few goods. And inflation eats up the value of money. So people end up worse than before. Moreover, having a pricey primary commodity hardens your currency artificially. Iranian raisins and pecans and carpets are expensive in India for the arbitrary reason that Iran has petroleum. So exports are hurt (ironically, Obama's sanctions may actually have been good for non-oil exports since the value of the riyal dropped). Small oil countries like Kuwait can sometimes bribe their people to keep quiescent, though that doesn't always work (in Bahrain sectarian disputes make that bargain hard to implement).

Anyway, what appear to be remnants of the failed 2009 Green Movement emerged among the crowds, chanting not for reform but for the fall of the regime. People condemned the "dictator" (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's clerical leader) and also slammed President Hassan Rouhani. They said they wanted the akhunds, a disrespectful word for clerics, to "give back the country."

They also wanted to know why Iran was spending all that money propping up the al-Assad regime in Syria instead of spending it on the Iranian public. This theme of "Iran first" had also been prominent in 2009.

People in Quchan (in the far east of the country over near Turkmenistan) were chanting "Death to Rouhani!" and denouncing high prices:

To the extent that the protests come out of economic distress, the US is certainly a big part of the problem here, acting in part at the behest of the Israel lobbies and in part at those of the arms manufacturers and oil interests. The US overthrew the Iranian government in 1953 in part by putting a severe boycott on nationalized Iranian oil, and provoking protests against the nationalist prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh.

That is the GOP and Trump playbook again these days.

Which is not to say that there aren't real discontents in Iran. It remains to be seen how widespread and intense they are.If we learned anything in 2017, it's this: Don't believe everything you read on the internet.

You may have heard, for example, that Google is preparing a new unified operating system to replace Chrome OS (the operating system that powers Chromebooks) and Android (the operating system that powers most smartphones).

Facts and forecasts are often packed together to persuade you of the premise that Google intends to replace Chrome OS and Android, and soon.

Let's unpack all this, and start by separating facts from forecasts.

Just the facts

Google is in fact working on an open-source operating system called Fuchsia.

The company first posted Fuchsia code on GitHub in August 2016.

Unlike Google's other operating systems (Chrome OS and Android), Fuchsia isn't based on Linux, but on a kernel called Zircon. (Zircon used to be called "Magenta.")

Zircon was originally intended to serve as a "real-time OS," meaning an embedded systems OS. However, the code also shows that Fuchsia could theoretically run on any kind of device, including internet of things appliances, traffic lights, ATMs, smartwatches, smartphones, tablets and desktops — devices powered by ARM, MIPS and Intel x86 processors.

Fuchsia acquired a user interface in May. The initial screens look like a smartphone UI.

Fuchsia also gained support for Apple's Swift programming language in November, adding to the several languages already supported.

The SDK used for building apps and UI on Fuchsia is Flutter, which is Google's SDK for building Chrome OS and Android apps. The graphics engine in Flutter also appears optimized for Google's Material Design. The early UI videos reveal a user interface obsessed with transition-heavy expansion and contraction of roundish rectangles, and a search-centric navigation.

A developer wrote on GitHub that Fuchsia "isn't a toy thing, it's not a 20% project, it's not a dumping ground of a dead thing we don't care about anymore." ("A 20% project" refers to an old Google policy of encouraging developers to spend 20% of their time exploring new innovations or possible products.)

That's what we know about Fuchsia.

We also know a thing or two about Google. We know, for example, that Google would like Chrome OS and Android to work better together.

Three and a half years ago, Google announced support for Android apps running on Chrome OS devices. The capability, called App Runtime for Chrome, has been in a kind of beta limbo ever since. In practical terms, some unknown number of people are running an unknown number of Android apps on Chrome every day.

At some point, Google launched a separate, unannounced initiative called Andromeda, apparently intended to get Chrome OS apps running on Android, and also get Android running on Chromebook-like devices.

Reports suggest that the Andromeda project was canceled last summer.

Some sharp-eyed observers have also pointed out that Google's Pixel Launcher, the new UI for Google phones and the now-discontinued Pixel C tablet, sports UI elements similar to the nascent UI of Fuchsia.

Those are the facts. Let's take a look at the fictions.

Just the forecasts

From this shallow pool of facts, hopeful commentators have invented several predictions.

The most widespread is that Fuchsia is the do-everything, run-everywhere, support-everything OS of everyone's dreams.

According to this set of predictions, Fuchsia will replace Android Wear, Android and Chrome OS, but run existing apps designed for those platforms. In other words, future Android phones would ship with Fuchsia instead of Android, and Chromebooks would ship with Fuchsia instead of Chrome OS.

That would spell the end of Chrome OS and Android as we know them and usher in a single-platform utopia for apps that run across all devices.

(Another set of predictions sees Fuchsia as a replacement for Android only. And yet another line of thinking says Fuchsia will power IoT gadgets and wearables — car dashboards and smartwatches, for example.)

The fabulous-Fuchsia faction assumes the new OS will solve whatever problems they're currently having with either Chrome OS or Android. Fuchsia is expected to end Android fragmentation, solve the problem of slow and uneven Android updates, enable developers to build single apps that run natively on both iOS and Android and boost the performance of Chromebooks.

Beyond these benefits, Google is expected to move fast without breaking things.

In other words, the timeline for the implementation of this Fuchsia future is assumed to be short, with Fuchsia replacing Chrome OS and Android in 2018 or soon thereafter.

To be clear: The predictions around Google's operating systems are based on wishful thinking and little more. Fuchsia is a kind of Rorschach test — people see in it whatever they want to see.

Color me incredulous

The replacement of Chrome OS and Android with Fuchsia implies the termination of Chrome OS and Android.

This is simultaneously the most common and also the least likely prediction.

Chrome OS devices are on the rise in enterprises and increasingly dominant in the education market. Chrome OS is the most Google-y of operating systems because it's based on a cloud-first model. It's arguably the most secure business-friendly client platform on the market, and for the same reason. A great many OEMs are happily building Chrome OS devices. Google has no incentive to take risks with Chrome OS.

Android is now the world's biggest operating system. Close to 2 billion people use Android, and the Play Store is approaching 3 million Android apps, far more than Apple's App Store. The OS is made available to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), from which OEMs can freely download and modify the software. Google has no incentive to take risks with Android.

But wait, you might say. If Fuchsia runs either Chrome OS or Android apps flawlessly out of the box (or both), then killing off these operating systems would be fine, right?

The answer is yes.

But launching a new operating system of any kind that runs millions of apps written for a different operating system (based on an entirely different kernel) is a difficult feat. Creating a new operating system that's ready for public use takes many years. And making one that runs apps from two distinct operating systems takes longer still.

So even if Fuchsia is released as a general-purpose or mobile operating system, it wouldn't replace Chrome OS or Android for many years. They would co-exist.

The likelihood of Google terminating, ending support for or replacing Android in the next five years is essentially zero. The replacement of Chrome OS in that time frame is also pretty unlikely.

Here's what's probable.

Google is thinking about the future. Fuchsia is probably intended to be OS future-proofing, a platform that above all offers two features that current OSs do not:

Speed. Augmented reality and virtual reality will require instant processing of incoming data, and also instant rendering of video without lag. As a real-time OS, Fuchsia could theoretically handle AR and VR better than Android. Other future applications, such as self-driving cars, will also need this attribute.

Augmented reality and virtual reality will require instant processing of incoming data, and also instant rendering of video without lag. As a real-time OS, Fuchsia could theoretically handle AR and VR better than Android. Other future applications, such as self-driving cars, will also need this attribute. Modularity. Fuchsia implies a post-Linux future where specific OSs could all be built on a common codebase, which would speed up processor manufacturing and software development and provide Google with much greater flexibility to support arbitrary hardware platforms. In the past, when Google wanted to experiment with Google Glass, self-driving cars and VR camera platforms, it had to work extremely hard to build custom software. Fuchsia could make such projects faster, easier and better.

Today, there are things Google operating systems do very well — namely, laptops and smartphones — and things Google operating systems don't do very well.

The most urgent are AR and VR headsets, goggles and glasses. It's reasonable to predict that Fuchsia will appear first in such devices.

You could also imagine seeing Fuchsia powering IoT and home automation devices, dashboard systems, wearables and other random smart objects.

Meanwhile, Chrome OS and Android will continue to exist and evolve.

If we know anything about Google, it's that the company is comfortable maintaining multiple competing platforms.

Google is also a great thrower of spaghetti against the wall (to see what sticks). We might see experimental dual-screen devices out of Google in the next few years running Fuchsia, or even budget smartphones for emerging markets.

Back to the question we started with: Will Google kill Chrome OS and Android in 2018? Or in the next few years?

The answer is no.R. Kelly is terrified of flying.

The R&B legend - who is famous for singing  ́I Believe I Can Fly '- travels everywhere by bus and reportedly nearly missed his guest spot with French indie band Phoenix at Coachella festival in California earlier this month due to his fear.

Phoenix singer Thomas Mars revealed the star had to travel for three days by road and nearly turned up late for the headlining set due to his phobia of planes.

He said: ''He doesn't fly, he only takes his tour bus. He had to leave Chicago on Wednesday to get to Coachella on Saturday. It took him three days. When we went on stage he was still in traffic.

''We got to his bit and he still wasn't there - then I saw this huge diamond microphone and I had the smell of cigar coming on the stage and he started singing.

''He finished the performance and went back to Chicago. He travelled for seven days for a five-minute performance.''

The 46-year-old singer performed his hit track  ́Ignition ́ over the French band ́s song  ́1901 ́and Thomas admits they were reluctant about the collaboration at first.

He told Xfm: ''Like every good idea it's... in the beginning you are allergic to it.

''You think yes but no. And then musically it made sense which was the biggest surprise to us that we worked with the song and something came out of it.''Getty Images

In June 2014, the Queen paid a visit to the set of Game of Thrones in Belfast. While the monarch got within inches of the show's famous Iron Throne, she didn't appear to be impressed by the chair, which is made of thousands of swords and definitely doesn't look comfortable. So, much to the disappointment of the show's producers, she turned down the chance to actually sit on it. "Apparently the Queen of England is not allowed to sit on a foreign throne," executive producer David Benioff explained during an interview with Late Night host Seth Meyers a year later. "This is an esoteric rule we didn't know about until that moment." Still, we're sure she appreciated the model version she was presented with at the end of her visit.In recent weeks, as much of the Pakistani media remained fixated on the internecine squabbles of the country's ruling elites, authorities in Sindh have been brutally cracking down on sections of workers and farmers in the province who've had the temerity to defend their rights and fight for improved living standards and working conditions.

On December 25, primary, secondary and high school teachers in Karachi held a defiant protest against the Sindh government due to its refusal to provide them with permanent jobs despite having agreed to do so in 2014. The provincial government is refusing to honor its agreement even after forcing teachers to pass a rigorous examination conducted by the National Testing Service and the University of Sindh.

Teachers from all over the province took part in the demonstration, including teachers from Hyderabad, some of whom marched the entire 140km distance to Karachi in order to participate. The teachers were attacked by the police when they tried to march toward the Chief Minister's House. The police used water cannons, batons and tear gas against the protesting teachers and scores were arrested. On Tuesday, the Sindh authorities claimed that two dozen teachers were detained and that all have since been released. However, according to officials of the All Sindh Primary Teachers Association, more than 150 teachers were arrested and many others were injured by the heavy-handed tactics of the police. Despite the violent response of the police, the teachers have refused to back down until their demands are met, with negotiations between teachers' representatives and the Sindh government ending in a stalemate on Friday.

Monday's police attack against demonstrators in Karachi was one of several such assaults on teachers in Sindh in recent weeks. While the tactics deployed against teachers have been brutal, the sheer ruthlessness with which the Sindh government recently cracked down on protesting farmers was nothing less than shocking.

On December 11, scores of increasingly impoverished sugar cane growers from all over the Sindh staged a protest in Karachi against local sugar mill owners as well as the provincial government. The sugar cane growers have been asking the government to fix the price of sugar cane at Rs185 per 40kgs, but sugar mill owners in the province have been paying the farmers as little as Rs130 per 40kgs, even though the government has officially set the price at Rs182 per 40kgs. During the protest, farmers denounced government corruption and slammed provincial officials for colluding with sugar mill owners at the expense of poor farmers. The sugar mill owners are refusing to pay the correct price despite the fact that they have received billions of rupees in subsidies from both the federal and provincial governments.

The peaceful protest, in which many women and children participated, was baton-charged by police only 30 minutes after it began. When this failed to have the desired effect, tear gas and water cannons were used against the farmers, with many falling unconscious. According to farmers' representatives, many sugar cane growers were injured and around 80 were arrested. While Sindh authorities were able to crush the protest in Karachi, the sugar cane growers have only grown more incensed and are unlikely to give up their struggle. On Thursday, a sugar cane grower set himself on fire during a farmers' demonstration in Mirpurkhas that called for mill owners to pay the sugar cane price fixed by the government.

Far from a problem unique to Sindh, police brutality is par for the course in Pakistan, where a tiny clique of capitalists, landlords and military elites have lorded over and exploited the working class and rural poor since the country's establishment.

The police in Punjab are notoriously corrupt and usually the first to resort to violence. On more than one occasion, police in Punjab have even used violent tactics against blind workers protesting for more job opportunities and the implementation of disabled-friendly policies in the province. Meanwhile, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, doctors and nurses have repeatedly been attacked by police when organizing protests to demand better working conditions.

The response of the state to protests and movements of workers, the rural poor and other oppressed groups contrasts sharply with its strategy of appeasement and accommodation when dealing fascistic Muslim clerics and other reactionaries when such forces hold protests and launch movements. Throughout the month of November, Islamic extremists were allowed to wreak havoc in the capital city of Islamabad for 3 weeks, complicating daily life for thousands of ordinary people. As usual, no meaningful action was taken against the religious right, despite violent behavior by the protestors. The Punjab Rangers chief as even caught on video distributing cash to the demonstrators and allowing them to take selfies with him. Eventually, the federal government caved in to the clerics' key demands, further empowering the clergy and emboldening extremist elements.

Indeed, while Pakistan's ruling elites won't hesitate to use brutal force against the poor and marginalized, they are unwilling to take any action against the Muslim clergy. The clergy benefit from the enduring legacy of the Partition, which incorporated communal divisions in the state structure of South Asia, elevating the status of the clerics in Pakistan and giving them tremendous sway over the country's political life.

Tax receipts would stay the same — but Connecticut taxpayers would effectively keep their federal SALT deductions. Or we could allow people to donate a portion of their income tax payment to a designated state-run nonprofit — perhaps the State Education Resource Center Foundation, claiming a federal charitable deduction that way.About the Show

Since that time, BTC continued to assert dominance in the market as it rose to a massive price peak of over $19,000 in December of 2017. Through April of 2018, ETH and BTC have both taken price hits, but the dominance in the market cap percentage has been rising for BTC, while it has been steadily decreasing for ETH. This is interesting considering the growing number of Ethereum dapps...



Ethereum dapps, which are many of the projects that you have seen ICO using ERC20 tokens, actually make up an astounding 85% of all crypto assets that have been issued under existing blockchains. All of these run on ETH as their 'gas' and rely on it to successfully operate, making Ethereum's value crucial in the scope of smart contract projects. Because of Ethereum's unique ability to cultivate and support deployment of crypto projects, it is in a great position to continue to thrive in this space. While there are cryptocurrencies that are building very similar functionality and even claim to have advantages over ETH, such as EOS and Cardano (ADA) - they have no working products at the moment. It will be important to keep an eye on projects like these, but ETH talks the talk and walks the walk.



While BTC is certainly the king of crypto today, ETH is the king of dapps. You can view all Ethereum projects, including 515 that are live and actively earning profits at State of the dapps. This increasing dapp support, along with the recent slide in market cap dominance, could be an indicator of an Ethereum run to come when the bear market subsides. ETH trades at $363 USD today on just about all crypto platforms such as Bittrex, Coinbase, Gemini and Binance.A major house fire in Winnipeg on Friday morning was deliberately set after a fight arose over a $10 payment, according to police.

Emergency services first responded to the fire on Pritchard Avenue around 7:20 a.m. Friday. The house was eventually deemed a complete loss despite efforts to extinguish the fire, police said.

All individuals managed to escape the structure and no one was significantly injured in the fire.

The incident was deemed suspicious and an investigation was initiated by Major Crimes Unit.

Investigators now believe the incident started with three people consuming alcohol and using methamphetamine inside one of the units.

Police said a fight broke out over a $10 payment, and one person was removed from the suite.

This person then allegedly broke a large window before returning and threatening to retaliate, at which time the fire was set, police said.

Around 7:20 p.m. Friday police identified a suspect and investigators arrested a 17-year-old female youth at a hotel.

The teen has been charged with multiple offences including five counts of arson with disregard for human life.

Police said the entire house, including rooms belonging to three other tenants, became completely engulfed in flames and the house was completely destroyed.

The 17-year-old remains in custody.

2012-2013 eğitim-öğretim yılında Selçuklu Belediyesi, Necmettin Erbakan Üniversitesi ve Selçuklu İlçe Milli Eğitim Müdürlüğünce öğrencilere temel insani değerlerin kazandırılmasını amaçlayan Selçuklu Değerler Eğitimi projesi (SEDEP) Konya'da başlatıldı.

Okul öncesi ,İlkokul, Ortaokul ve Lise öğrencilerine yönelik yapılan bu proje kapsamında Aralık ayı içerisinde bazı yayınlar öğrencilere ulaştırıldı.

Projenin sosyal medya hesabından yapılan açıklama da dağıtılan yayınların içeriği hakkında öğretmen ve öğrencilerin soluksuz okuyup eğleneceği hatta ellerinden hiç bırakamayacakları yayınlar olduğu ifade edilse de ,yayınlardan bazılarının pedagojik açıdan uygun olmayan görseller içerdiği görülüyor. Özellikle 3.sınıf 9 yaşındaki çocuklara, öğrencilere dağıtılan ''AKTÖRE'' isimli derginin ''Hangisi Kul Hakkı'' başlıklı bölümünde silahla başka birisinin kafasına ateş eden adam görseli kullanılması hem eğitimcilerin hem de velilerin tepkisini çekti.

Eğitim İş'ten tepki

Eğitim İş Konya Şubesi Başkanı Özgür Genç, konuyla ilgili yaptığı açıklamada "Öğrencilere dağıtılan bu yayınlar kimler tarafından hazırlanmıştır? Bu görseller hazırlanırken Pedagoglardan görüş alınmış mıdır? Tüm bu uyarılarımızdan sonra proje kapsamında öğrencilere dağıtılan dergilerin yeniden incelenmesi ve gerekli görülenlerin ivedilikle toplatılması hususunda projeye destek veren Selçuklu Belediyesi, Konya Necmettin Erbakan Üniversitesi ve Selçuklu İlçe Milli Eğitim Müdürlüğünün gerekli hassasiyeti göstereceklerini umut etmekteyiz." dedi.

Genç, "Eğitim-İş Sendikası olarak çocuklarımızın daha iyi bir Türkiye yaratabilmesi için Bilimsel, Laik, Ulusal ve Parasız eğitim için mücadelemize yılmadan devam edeceğiz." dedi.Just When You Thought Democrats Couldn't Get Any More Oblivious...

Theoretically, the left/liberal opposition party should have a lot to offer voters at the moment. After all, the country is presently being run by a cartoon of an evil billionaire, whose stated objective is to make his rich friends richer while eliminating regulations on predatory financial services companies, employers who injure and exploit their employees, and nursing homes that kill their patients. Most people do not support Donald Trump's agenda: the majority believe that the government ought to guarantee people healthcare coverage and that corporations should not receive a huge tax cut, but Trump's two major policy pushes have been for the elimination of the government's role in health care and the reduction of corporate taxes.

Yet somehow, amidst what should be an important political opportunity for the left, the Democratic Party has just received its lowest public approval rating in 25 years of polling. Ratings have been dropping throughout the year and are especially poor among young people. That poses a puzzle, because millennials are actually more liberal than ever, with a greater number now preferring socialism to capitalism. If they despise the Republican agenda, why aren't they all proud Democrats?

We can get some clues to the answer from Bill Scher's Politico essay "The Case For a Generic Democrat," which nicely encapsulates the Democratic obliviousness that is so harming the party's electoral fortunes. Scher makes the case that the Democrats should be as flavorless and insipid as possible, with no real values beyond platitudes and no real policies beyond opposing Republicans. As far as I can tell, he is quite serious about this. And the fact that there are Democrats who think this way tells us a lot about what is going wrong.

Scher says that Democrats "have been embroiled in a debate over how to fix what went wrong in 2016. Should they tack left or center? Woo white working-class voters with an ambitious economic agenda or double down on the base by blitzing Donald Trump on bigotry? Prioritize health care? Inequality? Oligarchy? Democracy?" But the victory of Doug Jones in Alabama, Scher says, "may have just rendered these debates irrelevant." After all, Doug Jones did not really do any of this: he didn't swing to the left or the right. "In fact, he didn't have any signature policy proposals at all." Instead, he took "the most pallid Democratic talking points... and campaigned with a pleasant, inoffensive demeanor. He was boring. He was safe. He was Mr. Generic Democrat. And it worked. That should make Democrats think twice about what they should be looking for in a 2020 presidential nominee." Scher says that Democrats should beware of boldness, because it risks "polarization." The Democratic candidate should be like Jones and draw as little attention to themselves as possible. Scher points out that polling match-ups between a Generic Democrat and Donald Trump show the Generic Democrat winning. He says that the strategy of being nothing more than a party cipher worked well for Warren Harding in 1920, though Scher admits that Harding is now almost universally regarded as one of the worst presidents in American history. And Scher gives suggestions for candidates who would be the top of the list under his strategy. Number one? Tim Kaine.

As I say, I'm pretty sure he is actually serious. He is serious even though uninspiring Democrats like John Kerry and Al Gore have consistently failed and charismatic Democrats like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have won. He is serious, even though Doug Jones barely squeaked into office with a deranged, far-right sexual predator as an opponent. He is serious, even though $25 million in campaign spending couldn't make this strategy work for Jon Ossoff, and even though this kind of thinking is openly contemptuous of voters, refusing to consider ways to fix the problems they face, and intentionally offering them absolutely nothing beyond "Have You Seen The Other Guy?" (Which, incidentally, Democrats "jokingly" proposed as a potential campaign bumper sticker.)

If your opponent is discredited by a scandal, running on the platform "I am not discredited by a scandal" may well secure you just enough votes to win. If Trump's scandals were enough to sink him, the Democrats wouldn't have to do much to get into office. But we have already seen that Trump's scandals aren't enough to sink him. A slew of women accused him of sexual assault in the lead-up to 2016, and Trump got millions more votes than squeaky-clean Mitt Romney. This "I am not my crazy opponent" pitch was exactly what Hillary Clinton ran on in 2016, and it got Donald Trump elected president. Bernie Sanders would have beaten Donald Trump, yet Scher wants to avoid "boldness" and haul Tim Kaine out to lose yet again. (Note that the logic seems to lead inevitably to choosing a white guy, like Gore or Kerry. A person of color might, after all, be "polarizing.")

Scher's is not the only kind of misguided Democratic thinking coming out at the moment. Consider Frank Bruni's recent New York Times column "Democrats Are The New Republicans." It's a headline I agree with, but for different reasons than Bruni, who believes that Democrats should position themselves as the true party of fiscal responsibility, family values, national security, and patriotism. Republicans, he says, have proved themselves entirely uncommitted to their stated principles, and "what a gorgeous opportunity they have given Democrats to steal that bogus rhetoric right out from under them." Democrats are "the party of fiscal responsibility because they don't pretend that they can afford grand government commitments... without collecting the revenue for them." They are the party of patriotism because they are "recognizing that a hostile foreign power tried to change the course of an American presidential election." And they are the party of "law and order" because "While many Republicans and their media mouthpiece, Fox News, labor to delegitimize the F.B.I. and thus inoculate Trump, Democrats put faith in prosecutors, agents and the system."

As I say, I don't exactly disagree that the Democratic Party now wilfully embraces a series of right-wing values like panicking about deficits, engaging in McCarthy-esque paranoia about foreign infiltrators, and embracing prosecutors and law enforcement. Bruni and I just have differing opinions on whether this is a good thing. As a leftist, I don't see anything wrong with "delegitimizing the FBI," an organization that has spent its entire history illegally spying on dissidents, and that in recent years has spent a disproportionate amount of its resources manufacturing fake terrorism plots in order to send hapless mentally ill Muslim men to prison. To be a "liberal" used to mean adopting the ACLU's stance toward prosecutors and the FBI: they're never to be trusted. Now that the FBI is seen as a potential ally against Donald Trump, their "legitimacy" must not be questioned.

I've suggested before that it's a bad idea for Democrats to adopt traditionally Republican rhetoric for reasons of political opportunism. First, and most importantly, it undermines the whole point of left politics: we're supposed to actually stand for left values, not whatever values are most useful to taunt Republicans with. We should therefore be sincere and consistent in refusing to enter the "Who Loves America More?" patriotism contest, and not adjusting our level of confidence in prosecutors' integrity based on whether they happen to be prosecuting people we dislike. What disgusts me about Bruni and Scher is that their kind of Democratic politics has no serious underlying principles. In responding to the question "What Should Democrats Stand For?" Scher's only consideration is what will get Democrats to office. He doesn't care what they actually do when they're in office (which is why he likes Warren G. Harding), whether they propose any actual policies or demonstrate any knowledge of how to accomplish anything that will improve human lives. Politics is nothing more than a contest for a few more seats in the legislature, and if the best way to get those is to abandon every hint of a strong moral conviction, well, so much the worse for your moral convictions.

But this kind of thinking is not just unprincipled, it's also bad strategy even on its own terms. Democrats have run no shortage of boring candidates who sound like Republicans. The "willfully uninspiring" approach to electoral politics seems to have been official party policy for the last eight years, and it has cost Democrats both a lot of state governments and a lot of Congressional seats. The party has failed to recognize the most basic truths about contemporary America: a lot of people are going through unnecessary economic hardships, and the party of the Working People has ceased to represent their interests. Just look at this recent Washington Post article about workers who were laid off from a McDonnell Douglas plant in Tulsa when it closed in 1994. Today, they are well into old age, but many of them are still working, whether as Wal Mart greeters or Dollar Tree cashiers. (Dollar stores are prospering at the moment because for some unfathomable reason millennials seem to do a lot of their shopping at them.) The Post discusses how the decline of pension plans has meant that many workers now face the prospect of remaining employed well into their final years of life, never retiring, never paying off their mortgages.

What does the Democratic Party have to offer these people? What is it proposing to do to fix this? Even the reworked "populist" messaging the party tried out after 2016 did little more than emphasize "jobs." But people have jobs, that's the problem. Unemployment is actually low at the moment, the problem is that many people's jobs suck, and that they are exhausted and hopeless and debt-ridden. The country needs its pension plans back, but that will require an incredible amount of ambition, since corporations are hardly going to do it willingly. The refusal to be "bold" is also a refusal to actually try to make life better for people.

There is a meme circulating among liberals at the moment that sums up the problem well. It encourages everyone on the left who dislikes the Democratic Party to suck it up and vote for them anyway:

Dear liberals and independents: In 2020 there will be a candidate competing against Donald Trump. It is very likely this candidate (1) isn't your first choice (2) isn't 100% ideologically pure (3) has made mistakes in their life (4) might not really excite you all that much (5) has ideas you are uncomfortable with. Please start getting over that shit now...

I like this because it admits that it's very unlikely the Democrats will nominate someone who is inspiring and who people are actually comfortable voting for. We've given up on the possibility before the race has even begun, we're getting a head start on compromising everything we're fighting for. (The party's informal slogan could be "You'll Eat It And You'll Like It.")

All I'm saying is that I don't think this is a good way to get millennials back to the party. "Shut up and vote for us" may work for party loyalists. But young people don't like the party, and the party treats them with total contempt. It promises nothing and delivers nothing. And yet there are those, like Scher and Bruni, who literally believe that this is sound political strategy. Some of us were screaming again and again during 2016 that unless the Democrats starting getting serious about offering a meaningful agenda, they would fail. But the definition of insanity is making the same basic observation over and over and expecting Democrats to listen...

Four general plans are under consideration and each has a map to illustrate exactly where recreational shooting is recommended and where it is prohibited. Some of the maps recommend wilderness areas for recreational shooting.

Colorado has 44 wilderness areas and eight of them are included in this management project: Indian Peaks, James Peak, Rawah, Neota, Never Summer, Byers Peak, Vasquez Peak and Mount Evans. This is an important management process, for I suspect that decisions involving these eight wilderness areas will be extended to all 44.

Colorado's public lands include national parks, monuments and conservation areas, state parks and wildlife areas, national forests and BLM lands, but wilderness areas are different from all others.

The Wilderness Act of 1964 was "to secure for the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness" and defined a wilderness area as "an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man" and "undeveloped Federal land retaining its primeval character and influence ... protected and managed so as to preserve its natural conditions" and "for solitude ..."

When we go to a wilderness area, we want to find the land unchanged by man, plant and animal communities in their natural states, with minimal evidence of and disturbance from other people in the wilderness.

My focus here is on dispersed recreational shooting in wilderness areas. I have no problem with hunting or shooting skeet or target practice in confined areas specifically designed for those activities. Is dispersed recreational shooting an appropriate activity for wilderness areas? I want to share an experience that sheds light on this question.

In the past, I enjoyed visiting an area approximately 200 yards west of the parking area at Sugarloaf Mountain. I frequented the site to photograph wildflowers and the insects attracted to them and other people used the site for dispersed camping.

But recreational shooters took it over, with several of them blasting away as fast as possible. Their intent was to cut down a tree — choose a tree and concentrate fire on it until the tree toppled over. Imagine the sound, which could be heard all the way to Ward and Nederland. Their frenzied racket drove away all others, including me.

In several months, they mowed down more than a dozen live trees — that was their mean and destructive recreation. When the shooters left, every single cartridge case remained on the ground and lead slugs were buried in stumps and sprayed across the landscape.

Recreational shooters have given themselves a very bad name. They have trashed numerous sites between Sugarloaf and the Indian Peaks Wilderness, and as they did so, they drove prudent people away. Hikers, photographers, artists, campers and fly fishermen can share a landscape, but sharing the landscape with rapid-fire weapons is a different matter altogether. Furthermore, littering the landscape with shell casings and poisoning it with lead shot is unacceptable.

It is patently obvious that the antics of recreational shooters are completely inappropriate for wilderness areas. Those public lands were established to preserve natural environments specifically chosen for their beauty and as resources for hiking, camping and other quiet ways of appreciating natural environments, and for the pursuit of solitude and tranquility. The Forest Service should certainly not list wildernesses as sites for recreational shooting, but should discourage all shooting other than hunting.

Our public lands are receiving unprecedented pressures to change their uses. The Bears Ears and Grand Staircase of the Escalante National Monuments are under attack specifically so that those majestic areas can be mined and drilled.

Right now, the Forest Service is being urged to recommend wilderness areas for recreational shooting. It is comfortable to expect that wilderness areas will remain unchanged forever, but that is a naïve notion inappropriate to our times. The cost of wilderness is constant vigilance and immediate action.

However, in 2012, its position in the village was threatened when a swanky new Lidl opened up right next door – and since then, an all-out war has raged between the two supermarkets, showing no signs of abating.

In-store announcements in JC's often refer to 'the Germans down the road' and any encroaching advertising from Lidl has been swiftly dealt with:

In the run-up to Christmas, JC's took things to a new level by hiring an electronic road sign to flash their offers over the wall into the Lidl car park.

In response, Lidl erected a wooden board to hide the sign – but JC's just used it to put up another of their own:

JC's posted a photo of their work on Facebook with a cheeky message to their "lovely neighbours":

Just a quick shout out and thank you to our lovely neighbours who installed this beautiful wood panel for us to display our advertisements.

This has 'summer comedy' written all over it. We're seeing Will Ferrell or Amy Poehler as the plucky JC's manager, and Danny DeVito as the Lidl overlord. What do ye think? It could be a hit!

DailyEdge is on Instagram!Will #metoo movement speed up the number of women in leadership -- or slow it down?

Participants march against sexual assault and harassment at the #MeToo March in the Hollywood section of Los Angeles. Associated Press/Nov. 12, 2017

As the wave of sexual harassment allegations reached seismic proportions, one solution touted repeatedly has been the need for more women in power.

Barack Obama suggested earlier this month in Paris that more women should be put into power "because men seem to be having some problems these days." Sheryl Sandberg, in a Facebook post, called for more women in leadership roles, arguing the power differential between men in women helps explain harassment. In article after article, from the Harvard Business Review to this newspaper, promoting more women into influential roles has been offered as a fix.

But will the current watershed moment lead to more women in top management roles -- or could it actually hold them back? That's a question getting more attention as the #metoo movement takes root in workplace after workplace with acute, urgent risks like reputation-crushing headlines or expensive legal proceedings. Some experts worry any backlash to the moment -- from overly cautious men to organizations with unfair expectations for the women who do get promoted -- could hurt the numbers rather than help them.

Others are cautiously optimistic that the current tremors could finally start to move the needle. The recent allegations have really helped to spotlight the lack of women in powerful roles, said Brande Stellings, who leads advisory services for Catalyst, a research and consulting organization focused on women in leadership.

Traditionally, she says, "one thing we will sometimes see that's part of why women don't get the top job is they're seen as a risky bet because of the stereotypes people have." But now, she said, "maybe men are a risky bet, and people are asking about the risk of not having women in power."

While years of headlines about the lack of gender diversity at the top have made a business case for getting more women into management, there hasn't been a lot of urgency for companies to take action. Now, ignoring diversity carries vastly more short-term risk, which could motivate employers to do more to advance female leaders.

"You would hope that companies [promote women] because diversity matters or because it's the right thing to ensure fairness, but often times companies are motivated from more of a compliance and risk management perspective," said Marianne Cooper, a sociologist at the Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford University. "I think there is an immediacy surrounding this issue" of sexual harassment.

The other possibility is that an improved focus on sexual harassment and toxic workplace cultures will prevent more women from leaving certain industries, such as technology, allowing them to naturally rise through the ranks, work in more inclusive cultures and aim for top-level jobs.

Sylvia Ann Hewlett, an economist and founder of the Center for Talent Innovation, said her firm's data show that women in technology, in particular, often opt to leave to avoid such "frat boy cultures. If we were able to change that and make them more inclusive and not so predatory toward women, women would not just stick it out -- they would be much more ambitious."

But she and others warn about the potential "collateral damage" of the #metoo movement, in which senior executive men could cut women out of social events, one-on-one dinners and informal after-work mentoring out of fear that they could say or do the wrong thing. Before the story about the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke, Hewlett's research found that 64 percent of men were already hesitant to meet one-on-one with female co-workers because they were fearful of the encounter being misconstrued.

That figure could be even higher now. Human resources executives are reporting that they're seeing evidence of more cautious men. Brian Kropp, who leads the H.R. consulting practice at CEB, said that issue has come up in 10 to 15 percent of the conversations he's had with H.R. executives over the past month.

"Some men -- while a minority, certainly -- are so concerned that something could happen that they're reacting by not engaging women in the informal part of work where you're mentoring people," Kropp said.

When that happens, it creates a particular hurdle for women trying to be promoted into more senior roles. At the higher ranks of an organization, it's critical for women to not only have a mentor but something Hewlett and others call a "sponsor," or a higher-ranking, more powerful executive who not only offers advice, but actively advocates for a junior employee's career.

"No one is going to get from the middle to the top unless there are people willing to speak up for them behind closed doors," Hewlett said.

But doing that requires more risk -- speaking up on behalf of the wrong junior executive can be damaging. That's why senior executives willing to speak up on someone else's behalf need to develop the kind of trust and understanding that's typically created in social and informal settings -- not in office meetings.

"You're not about to go out on a limb for someone if, really, they're looking for another job," Hewlett said.

Another risk is that organizations promote women because they have a cultural problem that needs fixing, and then expect them to do all the work.

"In all jobs, women do more of these service roles, " said University of Colorado Boulder professor Stefanie Johnson, such as ending up on diversity committees. "They call it organizational housekeeping."

If that happens, playing the role of culture police puts women in a particular bind, setting them up for the risk of failure once they reach those leadership roles. As New York magazine writer Rebecca Traister put it in a recent piece, "as designated guardians, entrusted -whether as colleagues or wives -- with policing men's bad behaviors, [women] will get dinged for complicity if they don't police it vigilantly enough, and risk being cast as castrating villainesses if they issue sentence."

To help ensure men continue acting as sponsors for more junior women, Hewlett suggests more communication and more accountability. One option is requiring senior managers to sponsor more junior executives who don't look just like them. Also important, Hewlett said, is for companies to be clear with executives about the places and times where informal work meetings are appropriate, so there's no question about whether a meal at a restaurant would set off alarm bells.

Also critical: Make sure that both men and women are expected to "sponsor" other employees. Catalyst's research shows that women face a double bind, where they don't get credit for supporting other workers, but get penalized if they don't. Men, meanwhile, get praised if they do take extra time to help colleagues, but face no repercussions if they skip it.

Such steps could guard against what some see as the possible -- if not inevitable -- backlash. Sandberg warned about it in her post, writing that "the percentage of men who will be afraid to be alone with a female colleague has to be sky high right now" and suggesting that whether men "take all your direct reports out to dinner or none of them, the key is to give men and women equal opportunities to succeed."

Others, too, fear a backlash -- or a chilling effect.

"I hate to say that, because I want to be more positive and optimistic, but this is about power, and men's dominant place in society," Johnson said. "And I think when people feel threatened, an obvious response is to push back."A once-liberal Oregon college town has been overcome with crime and emboldened groups of white supremacists.

The Oregonian spoke recently with several residents in the city of Eugene about the shocking and not-so-secret neo-Nazi extremists who have made their name known across the community.

Some of the individuals include two who are said to be the 'most prominent' men - Jacob Laskey and Jimmy Marr.

'Those guys have been hanging around the movement for years,' Carla Hill, investigative researcher for the Anti-Defamation League Center on Extremism told the local newspaper.

Along with other supporters, she said Laskey and Marr see an 'opportunity to make changes they dream of.'

Jimmy Marr, who goes by @genocideJimmy on Twitter, is shown inside his home in December. He told the Oregonian/OregonLive that he is 'interested in the counter-extermination of the Jews'

Marr spoke about the evolution of his ideas from his home in Springfield (pictured above)

Jacob Laskey (pictured in December) was sent to federal prison for 11 years after throwing rocks etched with swastikas into a synagogue in Eugene. He was released in 2015

During Laskey's time in prison, he wrote books, and one of them about his theory that the 'Holocaust was a hoax'

Now, Laskey said he has moved past the incidents, but hasn't denied his support of the groups

'They see this as this is their time,' Hill explained, while adding that Marr has been deemed 'Genocide Jimmy' by other white supremacy supporters.

On Holocaust Remembrance Day in January, supporters gathered outside Marr's home, where swastika flags flew near an elementary school, along with sign that said, 'The Holocaust is Hokum,' The Oregonian reports.

'I'll tell you this right now ... I'm interested in the counter-extermination of the Jews,' Marr told the newspaper during an interview inside his home.

As for Laskey, he was released from jail in 2015 after 11 years behind bars for tossing 'swastika-etched bricks through Temple Beth Israel' synagogue in the city.

During his time in prison, he wrote books, and one of them about his theory that the 'Holocaust was a hoax.'

Marr's address has long been public knowledge. On Holocaust Remembrance Day in January, swastika flags were flown near an elementary school, along with sign that said, 'The Holocaust is Hokum'

Now, Laskey said he has moved on from his past, but hasn't denied his support.

'Yes, I'm proud of my race. Yes, I'm proud of my heritage,' Laskey said. 'I'm not a fascist. I'm an American. Why can't we put America first?'

A woman working in the cannabis industry in the area, Bethany Sherman, was also accused of having a role in the racist group.

In honor of Adolf Hitler's birthday, one resident alleged Sherman baked 'cookies in the shape of swastikas,' the newspaper said.

Laskey previously praised Sherman on his YouTube channel and said she 'is a hero because she doesn't have white guilt.'

Shortly after the allegations, Sherman was forced to close down her marijuana testing lab after she was reproved by customers and other community members.

Owners of OG Analytical, a cannabis testing lab in Eugene, were alleged by Eugene activist to have participate in neo-Nazi activities

Another local business owner, who does not associate with the group, said she has been a target of hate and vandalism after she banned a group of individuals who openly expressed the white supremacist views from her bar.

Old Nick's Pub owner, Emily Nyman, told the newspaper that a swastika was painted outside her business with a message that said: 'We're watching you.'

Nyman, a supporter of the anti-fascist movement, said she was forced to hire a lawyer and contact the FBI after she was harassed online.

Along with her own protection, Nyman said she wishes to help others in Eugene - particularly ethnic minority groups.

'As a white businesswoman who has less to fear I feel like I owe it to the people in my community who can't speak out,' Nyman said.

Hate crimes in the city of Eugene went up by 44 since 2016 - as city officials recorded a total of 60 in 2017.

'Vandalism and graffiti made up 20 percent of the hate crimes reported between January and October,' The Oregonian reports.

'This year has seen a flurry of racist and anti-Semitic activity across the city. Vandals have struck cars, storefronts and public property with painted swastikas.

'Repugnant messages and symbols have defaced schools, churches and the federal courthouse.'

A local business owner, who does not associate with the group, said she has been a target of hate as well as vandalismFor decades it has been an oasis for women wishing to swim and sunbathe away from the prying eyes of men.

But now the famous Ladies' Pond on London's Hampstead Heath will no longer be a haven preserved for women after a controversial ruling allowed men transitioning to be women to bathe there.

Regular users of the tranquil fresh water pond – used by famous names such as actress Helena Bonham Carter, comedian Rhona Cameron and novelist Esther Freud – have complained in recent months that men who identify as women and wore female bathing clothes were using the pond.

The famous Ladies' Pond on London's Hampstead Heath will no longer be a haven preserved for women after a controversial ruling has allowed men transitioning to be women to use it

One veteran swimmer, Margaret Roberts, told how in one incident she asked a Spanish male who claimed to identify as a woman but 'looked and dressed like a man' to leave, but he refused.

She also described how fellow pond users were 'appalled' when a 'young man' wearing a bikini, who also said he was transitioning to become a woman, came to use the pond this summer.

Further controversy was caused when a woman who is transitioning to be a man called for the pond to be made 'gender fluid', Ms Roberts said.

This week, a spokesman for the City of London Corporation which manages the lake, confirmed to the MoS that men transitioning to women will be allowed to use the pond and the female changing rooms.

Further controversy was caused when a woman who is transitioning to be a man called for the pond to be made 'gender fluid', a veteran swimmer said

But last night, female bathers responded with outrage at the prospect of transitioning men being admitted to their 'special sanctuary' – despite there being a men's and a mixed pond available to use on the Heath.

Ms Roberts, who has been swimming in the open-air waters for 32 years, said: 'I and many others are threatened by having to have essentially "cross dressers" come to the pond and openly use our private space. Women have few private spaces and we have had to fight many times to keep the pond open.

'Can men not allow women to have any private space?'

The pond is used by famous names such as actress Helena Bonham Carter (left) and novelist Esther Freud (right)

Julie Bindel, a feminist writer who has also been swimming at the pond for more than three decades, added: 'It is totally unacceptable to allow men who identify as women, but who are otherwise male bodied and socialised as men, to be in a women-only space. I have seen mothers bring their young daughters who are self-conscious about their bodies but want to feel good about swimming and exposing their skin to the sun. The last thing they want is to look behind them and see a male-bodied person pretending to be a woman in order to gawp at them.'

The City of London Corporation spokesman said: 'Over the last year all lifeguards and managers at Hampstead Heath ponds have taken transgender awareness training courses, which have been offered to, and taken by, the ponds' swimming associations as well.

'We are working with the LGBTQ community to ensure our facilities are fit to serve the needs of everyone who enjoys them, and will continue to do so in the future.'Matthew Riehl, 37, was identified as the gunman who allegedly killed one deputy and injured four others in the Sunday shooting

The gunman, who allegedly killed a deputy and injured four other officers after firing 100 rounds in an 'ambush attack' in Colorado, was an Iraq War veteran who posted a YouTube video earlier this month claiming he was trying to unseat his local sheriff.

Matthew Riehl, 37, was identified as the gunman by local news station Denver 7, which cited 'two informed law enforcement sources'.

During the Sunday morning attack deputy Zackari Parrish, 29, was shot dead while responding to a verbal disturbance call around 5.15am.

Deputy Mike Doyle, 28, Deputy Taylor Davis, 30, Deputy Jeffrey Pelle, 32, - all of the Douglas County Sheriff's Office - and 41-year-old Castle Rock Police Officer Tom O'Donnell were injured.

Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock revealed at a press conference Sunday afternoon that all of the officers are in stable condition.

Authorities publicly identified Riehl, who was shot dead by a joint task force unit, on S.

Just two weeks ago, Riehl, recorded himself ranting about one of the Douglas County Sheriff's deputies, Brian Briggs.

In the bizarre YouTube video, Riehl can be seen holding up Briggs' business card as he calls him a 'pimp' multiple times.

Riehl then goes on to lash out at Sheriff Spurlock, calling him and his deputies 'clowns'.

'We're going to fire all these bums come next year,' Riehl is heard saying as he promotes his 'Libertarian' candidacy for the sheriff of Douglas County.

Riehl was deployed to Iraq from 2009-2010. He was honorably discharged in 2012 after nine years of service in the Army Reserve.

According to News 9, the YouTube video wasn't the first time Riehl lashed out at the sheriff's office.

He also reportedly exchanged a series of angry tweets with the Douglas Sheriff's Office.

During Sheriff Spurlock's press conference Sunday afternoon, he did say that officers 'are familiar with him [the suspect]'.

Some stood and saluted as the hearse passed by while others held up American flags in honor of the deceased deputy.

Parrish was one of five deputies who was shot while responding to a verbal disturbance call between two roommates around 5.15am on Sunday at the Copper Canyon Apartments on the 3400 block County Line Road between Colorado and University Boulevards.

The Douglas County Sheriff's Office tweeted that it was during the investigation at the building in Highlands Ranch that shots were fired with a rifle - nearly 100 rounds in an ambush-style attack.

Two civilians were also shot by the suspect, but sustained non-life-threatening injuries.

They have not been identified.

On Sunday afternoon, President Donald Trump sent a message of sympathy, tweeting: 'My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @DCSheriff, and their families.

'We love our police and law enforcement - God Bless them all! #LESM,' the president tweeted.

Sheriff Spurlock said the officers responded to a call that came in as a domestic dispute but was quickly revealed to be a verbal dispute between the shooter and his roommate.

It was the second time deputies had gone to the apartment Sunday.

There was another call at about 1.30am but there was no noise when deputies arrived.

After being let in, and confronting the suspect, who had barricaded himself in a bedroom, the officers were almost immediately met with fire.

The sheriff said there is no timeline available yet as to who was shot first but that all of them were shot 'very very quickly and all went down within seconds of other'.

Authorities said the roommate, who was home, was not injured and the two civilians were not in the apartment.

Parrish is survived by his wife and two young daughters and a GoFundMe account has been set up to help support them.

So far, $123,126 has been raised.

According to WBPF, a sheriff's office spokesperson confirmed that a SWAT team arrived at the home where the shooting occurred around 7.15am.

Video broadcast by Denver 7 showed an Arapahoe County Sheriff Bomb Squad truck at the scene.

The sheriff's office earlier issued a 'Code Red' on Twitter, instructing residents in the area to shelter in place.

'A Code Red was sent out regarding this incident. Any citizens in the affected area are instructed to shelter in place, avoid windows and stay away from exterior walls,' read the post sent out around 6.15am local time.

Much remains unclear about Riehl's life and his actions leading up to the shooting, but he did have an interest in guns.

Photos on Riehl's Facebook page show him posing with a few weapons. According to the New York Times, Riehl took an introductory course in carbine rifles in June.

The course was run a company called Kenaz Tactical Group, according to Robert Butler, the company's owner and lead instructor.

Butler said Riehl seemed like 'just the ordinary student' and did not seem unstable or violent.

Giving his first public reaction to four days of anti-government demonstrations, Rouhani was quoted by Mehr news agency as telling his cabinet: "Iranians understand the sensitive situation of Iran and region and will act based on their national interests."

Rouhani rebuffed U.S. President Donald Trump's comments in support of the protests and said "those who called Iranians terrorists have no business sympathizing with our nation."

Think again.

After The New York Times on Saturday published a story headlined "Republican Attacks on Mueller and F.B.I. Open New Rift in G.O.P.," WikiLeaks couldn't stand it anymore. In a late-night post on Twitter, WikiLeaks revealed that a Times reporter used to feed State Department email updates of the stories the paper would be publishing DAYS before the stories appeared.

At the time, Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State.

Email shows New York Times handed over Cablegate's publication schedule to the US government (without telling @WikiLeaks) giving the State Department, then headed by Hillary Clinton, up to 9 days in advance to spin the revelations or create diversions. https://t.co/IMrDOwoCd2 pic.twitter.com/CT4XkEs8Mc — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) December 31, 2017

The heads-up email was intended to give State (and Clinton) time to come up with some spin for stories that may have caused problems. Or, in another possible scenario, the heads up could give the State Department time to create a diversion for the same day, thus overriding a damaging story with other news its friends in the mainstream media would happily cover instead.

The players in the WikiLeaks email are interesting. Scott Shane is the national security reporter for the Times. And the recipient of his email, Philip Crowley, was at the time the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs under Clinton's State Department.

As 2017 comes to an end, it's clear the Clinton scandals won't go away anytime soon.

On Friday, the Justice Department released thousands of Clinton emails. "Several emails with classified information from former Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin were among a tranche of documents released Friday that were found on Anthony Weiner's personal computer during an FBI probe," USA Today reported.Before turning off the mic for Christmas break last Friday, "The Big Voice on the Right" went on the record with three big predictions about the 2018 election and some general prognostications about the Left's narratives — all of which would be welcome developments for conservatives.

In their desperation to take down Donald Trump, the Democrats and their drive-by counterparts have convinced themselves that they've already won the midterms, but all they've really done, Rush Limbaugh suggested, is walked themselves out onto a "plank."

"I'm gonna go on record December 22, 2017: Based on all that is known now, the Republican Party is not gonna lose control of the House, they're not gonna lose control of the Senate — and, in fact, the Democrats may lose even more seats in the Senate," said Limbaugh. "They're getting so far ahead of themselves that they're out walking a plank, and they have no idea how thin and precariously balanced it is."

The narratives the Left are counting on to give them the election — like the crumbling Russia collusion narrative and the supposed tax reform fallout — explained Limbaugh, will end up backfiring. The "collusion" narrative is already in shambles, he said.

"If there was any collusion, it was between Hillary and the Democrats and the DOJ and the FBI with a tinge of Russia thrown in with the Trump dossier, and this doesn't take any detective work," said Rush. "They have as much as admitted this in books written about the Clinton campaign, the Trump dossier and how that was commissioned. And the fact that all of these deep state people have been lying and making up these quotes for a full year about Russian collusion with no evidence whatsoever. There's no doubt in any of our minds what's really been going on here."

Meanwhile, as more Americans come to see the positive economic and personal impact of the Republicans' tax reform bill, all those polls the left-leaning media have cited as evidence that Americans hate it, will prove to be as empty as those predicting that Hillary would trounce Trump.

"They're repeating almost verbatim the same mistakes," said Limbaugh. "They've already got Trump beaten. I told you earlier this week: They think they've won the House back, and they're gonna be campaigning on two things. They're gonna be campaigning on this tax bill. They think they can really make points by criticizing the Republicans for letting you keep more of your money. The Democrats think there's some election to be won by promising to take your money back and giving it to Washington so that we can repay what the government has been heisted."

In response to CBS' John Dickerson reading bad poll numbers for the GOP tax bill, Limbaugh said the media is "not looking at that the right way."

"You drove those numbers down, Dickerson! You are the reason that people have such a low opinion of the tax cut bill," said Rush. "But once it is implemented and once the growth happens and once the personal income starts rising, what do you think's gonna happen to those poll numbers, Mr. Dickerson? You've driven 'em down so low there's only one way they can go. This tax cut can only become more popular in the polls."

The media, he added later, "has been telling everybody their taxes are going up, and people have believed it. The fact is 80% of taxpayers are going to get a tax cut. Eighty percent of Americans, 80% of people who pay taxes are gonna get a massive tax rate reduction. The last famous Democrat that ran for office promising to raise your taxes was Walter F. Mondull in 1984. He lost in a 49-state landslide."

After playing a soundbite of CBS' Susan Page declaring that "engagement by women voters" is part of the reason Republicans' prospects look so grim for 2018, Limbaugh asked his audience how many actually believe it.

"[W]e're to believe that they're really mad at Trump, that women voters really hate Trump," he said. "And those voters are gonna drive the midterm elections, and throw Trump out of office in 2020 and the Republicans out of the House and Senate in 2018. ... Weren't these all the same people who thought Hillary was gonna win the presidency? Weren't these the same people who believed all the polling data that said that Hillary was gonna win the presidency?"

Partial transcript via RushLimbaugh.comThe use of Python as a data science tool has been on the rise over the past few years: 54% of the respondents of the latest O'Reilly Data Science Salary Survey indicated that they used Python. The results of the 2015 survey indicated that 51% of the respondents used Python.

Nobody can deny that Python has been on the rise in the data science industry and it certainly seems that it's here to stay.

This rise in popularity in the industry, the long gone infancy of Python packages for data analysis, the low and gradual learning curve and the fact that it is a fully fledged programming language are only a couple of reasons that make Python an exceptional tool for data science.

Although Python is a very readable language, you might still be able to use some help as a data science student or beginning data scientist.

So, that's enough reason for me to make a cheat sheet for Python for data science, especially for beginners. It can serve as a quick reference for those of you who are just beginning their data science journey or it can serve as a guide to make it easier to learn about and use Python.

This cheat sheet is free additional material that complements DataCamp's Intro to Python for Data Science course, where you learn by doing.

If you want to download the cheat sheet, go here. The cheat sheet will guide you through variables and data types, Strings, Lists, to eventually land at the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, Numpy. Below is a screenshot (the original is much easier to read.)We've already made acquaintances with an adorable purple-haired girl and her creator Prudence (you can find the first post about her here), who isn't afraid of making fun of the everyday problems she faces. Now she's back with more illustrations of situations a lot of women go through each day, and once again she encourages everyone to forget about those worries and smile.

"Some things in life are just too awkward, too stupid or too hard (or let's face it: too funny) to deal with," the author explains her inspiration for the illustrations she uploads on her social media accounts that at this point have over 470k followers. The support she got proved to her that she isn't alone facing those struggles and revealing them only helps with getting over them.

Thank you for providing pony material for all of us to enjoyThe Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) has detained a member of the banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (New JMB) from near Kutupalong Rohingya camp in Cox's Bazar's Ukhiya upazila. In a separate drive, the RAB members have detained two muggers for allegedly killing a tourist in the same district. New JMB member Md Sharful Awal, 35 was arrested from Court Bazar area (adjacent to Kutupalong Rohingya Camp) in Ukhiya upazila while the two muggers named Saiful Islam and Khayer Hossain were detained in a separate drive from city's Jhilongjha area on Saturday night.Company Commander of RAB 7 Cox's Bazar camp Major Md Ruhul Amin told the Dhaka Tribune that militant Sharful was detained based on tip-off. "Shariful was arrested earlier in Chittagong in four cases filed under Anti-Terrorism Act and Explosive Substances Act over active his alleged involvement in the militant activities," the RAB commander said. "He [Sahriful] restarted communicating with international militant groups and was about to be involved in sabotage activities by mobilizing militants in the country through social media sites in an effort to establish Khilafat (a caliphate) after being released on bail in January 2017," he added. Meanwhile, the two muggers Saiful and Khayer was detained for killing a tourist named Abu Taher in city's Baharchhara intersection on December 15. The mobile phone of the deceased tourist was also recovered from their possession, Major Ruhul Amin said.Ishrat Jahan, who was one of the five litigators who went to court against Instant Triple Talaq has joined the Bharatiya Janata Party. On presence of party leaders, she joined Bengal BJP on Saturday, reports ABP. She was instrumental in the long struggle against Triple Talaq which finally lead to SC calling it as unconstitutional. Now, the Centre has passed a bill in Lok Sabha, which seeks to give three years jail to any Muslim man giving instant triple talaq to his wife.

On Saturday, Ishrat Jahan joined BJP and said that she had supported the party on the question of Triple Talaq. According to Ishrat, that finally prompted her to join the saffron party. BJP Mahila Morcha President Locket Chatterjee said that Ishrat is going through a financial crisis and they will urge the Central government to give her a job. Locket alleged that the state government hasn't extended any hep to Ishrat Jahan, who spearheaded such a historic movement. Locket felicitated Ishrat Jahan after she joined BJP.

Ishrat earlier said that her life has become worse after the verdict . Speaking to DNA at her home on Nando Ghosh Road, in Howrah district, Ishrat said that the apex court verdict has proved to be more of a bane as she had been socially ostracised and there is a growing sense of insecurity about her future. "It has been the loneliest Eid-ul-Adha (Bakri Eid) for me," she says from her 7 feet x 10 feet room. "No one came over for the customary embrace and exchange of greetings. Since the day of the judgement, the only good thing that has happened is that the electricity connection, which was cut, had been restored. My in-laws want me to withdraw the case and some neighbours are threatening me because they think I have spoken against the Muslim religious law."

She said the media attention has gone against her, and she has had to drop her customary naqab or veil to fence off imposters. "Strangers throng my house as if I am a tourist attraction," she said. "I used to put on a naqab, but then someone from the locality pretended to be me and gave an interview to the media. If an imposter makes any loose comment, I will have to bear the brunt. That is why I have decided to come out of the veil."YOUR HOME — You thought being stationed close to home would be a good idea, since you could hang out with old friends, see family more often, and pocket a little BAH while living at home.

But that all came crashing down when you realized that your mom's new boyfriend looked all too familiar, sources confirmed today.

At first you couldn't quite put your finger on it, then that next morning as you were driving onto base, it hit you: One of the gate guards at your base is dating your mom.

You couldn't mask your discomfort when you pulled up Gate A1 and handed him your ID, officials said. They added that you tried not to make eye contact but you subtly wanted to make sure you weren't crazy and took one more glance.

"Fuck! Yup, it's him," you reportedly said, before noticing that he just winked at you.

He looks like a nice enough guy, although he seems to have the gracefulness of a traffic cone blowing in the wind, according to some reports.

Officials say you're already picturing him sitting at the dinner table asking you things like, "what made you want to join the military", "what's it like being a hero", and "did you know how beautiful your mother is?"

It's also been confirmed that he will inevitably tell you about what service he went into in a long drawn-out story that will feel like an eternity. When you're left alone with him in the kitchen, officials say he will go on about how he used to "chase tail" when he was your age in a undeniably gross encounter.

Still, sources say you shouldn't even start thinking about when she eventually breaks up with him.

You're going to have to track down his schedule and make sure you don't go to whatever gate he's working that day and his hours, a source added, since "this is your life now."

At press time, your mom just posted something on Facebook that says "Going out for a special night with a special somebody," followed by four heart emojis, 4 more kissy face emojis, and one wink emoji.

"God fucking damn it," you reportedly said.German Parliamentary President Wolfgang Schäuble voiced his opposition to recent calls by Social Democratic Party (SPD) leader Martin Schulz for the creation of a United States of Europe in the next few years.

Schäuble, a former German finance minister and one of the most powerful politicians in Angela Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), acknowledged the need for a "stronger Europe," but was skeptical of Schulz's approach.

Schäuble (above) told the Berlin-based newspaper Tagesspiegel am Sonntag that the best way to strengthen Europe was to find the right path forward regarding integration.

"To say that one wants to create a United States of Europe within five years and that those states that don't go along will be thrown out seems a bit shortsighted, to put it politely."

SPD leader Martin Schulz wants a 'United States of Europe'

He also noted that in times of fast-paced change people "obviously have the need to hang on to a piece of their own national traditions. And it would be wrong to rob them of the sense of security and connection to their own nations."

Schäuble said he preferred the measures recently put forth by French President Emmanuel Macron, adding: "They are not geared toward an institutional restructuring of the EU but are rather an attempt to move forward without having to change the EU treaty."

He opposed halting European integration, noting that there are many other issues requiring Europe's attention, including migration policy, US tax policy, challenges in Africa and market globalization.

"The world does not allow us to rest," he said. "It's always dangerous to rest during supposedly calm and economically good times."

bik,js/se (dpa, KNA)It was just before midnight on November 19 that Chancellor Angela Merkel's dream of a so-called "Jamaica coalition" collapsed. The political constellation consisting of the conservative union parties (CDU/CSU), the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) and the pro-environment Greens — whose colors together reflect those of the Caribbean country's flag — was to not be.

Christian Lindner, the FDP leader, stood up from the negotiating table in the Parliamentary Association building and declared that his party had had enough. The FDP could not support policies they didn't believe in, he said. Outside, Lindner said a few words into the microphones, then vanished into the night.

Disappointed and aghast, the chancellor was left with the negotiators from her own Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, and the Greens. Merkel thought she had almost secured her fourth term in office, had believed the new Jamaica coalition was possible — and now this. Weeks of exploratory talks revealed political gulfs between the parties that even Merkel, the experienced strategist, couldn't bridge.

Germany is changing

So in 2017 Merkel failed to achieve what she had managed three times before: presenting a new cabinet a few weeks after the election and a sheaf of papers bearing the title "Coalition Agreement." The new distribution of power in the Bundestag had left her with much less room to maneuver after the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered parliament for the first time, securing 12.6 percent of the vote.

The CDU, in turn, lost so much support that the only way it could form a dual alliance was with the Social Democrats (SPD). One reason for the CDU's disappointing election result was Merkel's controversial refugee policy, which had led to a rift with her Bavarian sister party, the CSU, and had polarized German society. Never before had the chancellor been heckled on the campaign trail with shouts of "Get lost!" and "Merkel must go!" Now she had gambled on the Jamaica alliance, in vain. Once again, the prospect of forming a government was wide open.

Merkel: Home alone

Germans are seen as having staying power — in politics, too. Helmut Kohl, who died last year, was chancellor for 16 years. Angela Merkel has been in office since 2005 and feels well qualified to follow in his footsteps. The problem is, she can't find partners to support her anymore. Her critics say that whoever governs with, or rather under, Angela Merkel gets marginalized, and is essentially governed into the ground.

The last three federal elections clearly demonstrated this. In 2009, after the first grand coalition between the SPD and the CDU/CSU, the Social Democrats' share of the vote dropped dramatically. Then in 2013, after four years in government with Merkel, the FDP didn't even get the 5 percent of the vote required for representation in the Bundestag, and it took them a very long time to recover. Another grand coalition followed, which again did not pay off for the SPD: On 24 September, 2017, the Social Democrats suffered the worst election result in their history. The once-proud national party plummeted in the polls, gaining just 20.5 percent of the vote.

A brief window for change

Yet 2017 started so promisingly for the SPD. At the end of January, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, whom few Social Democrats saw as a heavy-hitting challenger for Merkel, stepped down as leader of the SPD. He presented Martin Schulz, the long-term president of the European Parliament, as his successor and the SPD's chancellor candidate.

The Social Democrats responded to the decision as if it were a long-awaited omen of liberation. They celebrated Schulz, the former bookseller from Würselen, as their savior and redeemer. The SPD gained thousands of new members. Schulz was elected party leader with a sensational 100 percent of the vote. The Social Democrats shot up in the opinion polls, and at times they were put ahead of the CDU. It seemed that the winds of change were blowing.

Schulz gave the SPD a massive boost in the polls in early 2017, but the upswing didn't last

But the Schulz hype turned out to be just a flash in the pan. One after another the SPD lost state elections in Saarland, Schleswig-Holstein, and in the party heartland of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). The political rule of thumb is that you can't win on a federal level if you lose in NRW.

And it proved just so: Angela Merkel remained unfazed by the euphoria around Martin Schulz; she made up ground in the polls and by early summer was clearly ahead again. For his part, Schulz failed to capitalize on being a fresh face on the domestic political scene and not having been part of Merkel's coalition cabinet. He misdirected his energy during the campaign and didn't press the chancellor hard enough on policy detail.

Read more: German Social Democrat: 'We failed miserably as a party'

On election night, when it became clear that the SPD had suffered heavy losses, Schulz took appropriate action. Addressing his supporters at party headquarters in the Willy-Brandt-Haus, he announced that the grand coalition had been voted out. His words were met with a storm of applause. "I have therefore recommended to the SPD party leadership that the SPD should go into opposition," he said. In opposition, his party would "fundamentally reposition itself" and put clear blue water between itself and the CDU. It hadn't been possible to do this as part of a coalition government, he said.

Steinmeier opposes fresh elections

But when the Jamaica idea bit the dust, Martin Schulz's phone rang. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier asked the SPD leader to visit him at his residence, Schloss Bellevue — along with the party leaders of the CDU and CSU. From that point on, the SPD could say goodbye to the prospect of regenerating in opposition. The head of state's message was clear: As the second-largest party in parliament, the SPD also shared some of the responsibility for ensuring that Germany got a stable government again. Failure to form a coalition and consequent new elections were not, he said, an acceptable solution.

So, once again, all eyes are suddenly on the SPD, the party which Merkel described after the vote as "not fit for government." There's no talk of that now, not since the power-conscious CDU leader started homing in on the "Grand Coalition 3" project, dubbed "GroKo 3." Merkel's party backed her when the Jamaica exploratory talks collapsed. The CDU also resolved its quarrels with the CSU. All that's missing is a coalition partner.

'Open-ended talks'

Schulz was forced to make a move. Eventually he announced that he was prepared to enter into "constructive, but open-ended" exploratory talks with the CDU. At the SPD party conference he was given a mandate to negotiate, but many Social Democrats urgently warned against entering into a grand coalition under Merkel's leadership for a third time. They fear the SPD would not be able to implement key elements of its program, such as greater state coordination of health insurance or allowing refugees' immediate family members to join them in Germany.

In its unease about a repeat of the unpopular dual alliance, the SPD is now putting forward alternative models, such as a so-called cooperation coalition, which would only commit to certain common goals, leaving contentious points open. Merkel isn't keen on these proposals. A grand coalition would have a clear majority of 399 in the new Bundestag, which now comprises 709 representatives, making it the largest in history. If she can't bring about a coalition agreement, Merkel will be on shaky ground. It's far from given that the CDU would still close ranks behind her if another election were called.

New talks in a new year

For now, the situation remains unresolved. The majority of voters don't like this. Business leaders are pressing for a solution, and allies in Europe are raising their eyebrows. French President Emmanuel Macron recently wished Angela Merkel "bon courage" — good luck. His plans for reforming the EU can't progress without a new German government.

Exploratory talks are set to begin on January 7. Schulz has promised his party that he will include it at every step, so he wants to hold a congress to get the approval of party delegates before exploratory talks would progress into formal coalition talks. The bigger hurdle, however, would come after that: The SPD's 440,000 members will be allowed to vote on whether or not it should enter into another grand coalition. The general prognosis is that there is little chance of a new government being in place before Easter. So the extraordinary election year 2017 ends with the old grand coalition carrying on with business as usual, until the new grand coalition has — perhaps — been cobbled together.There seems to be a problem serving the request at this timeThe 'former' Conan Doyle pub on Broughton Street. Pictures: Alan Jenkins

Drinkers in the popular Conan Doyle pub, on the edge of Edinburgh's New Town, were astonished to find it magically re-branded - as the JK Rowling.

Owners Nicholson's Pubs were staying tight-lipped on Sunday - but it is understood the swift moniker change is an elaborate stunt for Hogmanay.

As news of the change spread on social media yesterday, speculation was rife as to the reasoning behind it.

Sign up to our daily newsletter The i newsletter cut through the noise Thanks for signing up! Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later. Submitting...

Lucy Barker tweeted: "Hello @Nicholsonspubs, why has the Conan Doyle pub been renamed the @jk_rowling?"

Others were left less than enamoured at the prospect of a permanent name change - prompting fledgling campaign calls.

"The JK Rowling', famous for being close to the birthplace of...erm... Sir Arthur Conan Doyle!!! Bad move people! #ChangeItBack," tweeted Lord Wobbly.

Not only has the pub been emblazoned with its new name, but the elaborate gimmick includes a stand-in sign.

It depicts Harry Potter author Rowling, also synonymous with the city, sitting at a table by a window.

In front of the billionaire author is a notepad while she appears to be tucking in to a pub meal.

The pub was named after the great Scots storyteller Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle who was born in nearby Picardy Place in 1859.

A bronze statue to his most famous character Sherlock Holmes overlooks the pub in York Place.

Rowling famously wrote the best-selling Harry Potter books at The Elephant House, a mile away in Edinburgh's Old Town.

What she makes of the stunt was unclear last night - as was whether it includes the pub serving butterbeer, a favourite tipple of the characters in her books.BER sucht Personal, das ohne zu lachen den Eröffnungstermin kommunizieren kann

Berlin (EZ) | Letzte Woche wurde ein neuer Eröffnungstermin verkündet, heute schon finden sich in zahlreichen Zeitungen Stellenanzeigen: die Bauherren des BER suchen Mitarbeiter, die den Termin nach außen kommunizieren, ohne in schallendes Gelächter auszubrechen.

Es winken eine überdurchschnittliche Entlohnung, sechs Wochen Urlaub, ein 14. Monatsgehalt und viele geldwerte Vorteile – was zunächst wie ein Traumjob aussieht, entpuppt sich aber bei näherer Betrachtung als wahre Knochenarbeit mit höllischem Anspruch. Denn die ganzseitigen Anzeigen, die heute beispielsweise in der FAZ, in der Süddeutschen und in der New York Times zu sehen sind, werben für eine PR-Stelle, die es in sich hat. Gesucht wird eine Person, die den jüngst vorgestellten Eröffnungstermin des im Bau befindlichen Haupstadtflughafens BER schmunzel- und grinslos kommuniziert.

Bewerben kann sich praktisch jeder. Nicht einmal Vorkenntnisse in Presse- und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit sind vonnöten. Einzige Bedingung ist, dass man "völlig ernst, sachlich und trocken den Eröffnungstermin im Oktober 2020" verkaufen kann. Besonders angesprochen werden Menschen, die "ohnehin wenig lachen, sich eher als humorlos bezeichnen würden und Autisten".

Die Personalabteilung weist in den Anzeigen ausdrücklich darauf hin, dass auf eine gepflegte äußere Erscheinung kein besonderer Wert gelegt wird. "Im Zweifelsfall", heißt es, "stellen wir Ihnen jemanden zur Seite, der sich um Ihre körperliche Verfassung kümmert". Deutschsprachigkeit sei wünschenswert, schriftliche Fähigkeiten werden nicht vorausgesetzt. Selbst Bewerbungen, die auf einem benutzten Taschentuch verfasst wurden, werden "gerne angenommen."

Fragen zu der Stelle, die ab sofort zu besetzen ist, beantwortet die Betreibergesellschaft des BER unter der allgemeinen Telefonnummer 030/60911150.

(BSCH/Foto: Von OTFW, Berlin – Selbst fotografiert, CC BY-SA 3.0, Link)NEW YORK -- The NBA is hoping that its new format for the All-Star Game will add some energy to the event, as fan voting is scheduled to begin Dec. 21.

Fan voting begins that day on NBA.com and the NBA App. Voting through all other formats, such as Twitter and Facebook and including Amazon Alexa for the first time, starts on Christmas Day before the annual five-game slate.

There will also be five 2-for-1 days where ballots cast through the NBA App and NBA.com, along with Sina Weibo and Tencent in China, will count twice. Those days are Dec. 31, Jan. 4, Jan. 11, Jan. 12 and Jan. 15 -- the day balloting ends.

Continuing a policy instituted last season, players and media will join fans in the voting process. The fan vote accounts for 50 percent, while players and a media panel each account for 25 percent.

The NBA had previously announced that the Eastern vs. Western Conference format would be scrapped for the first time, replaced by captains choosing sides in the latest effort to generate more enthusiasm and perhaps competitiveness for the game.

The starters from each conference with the highest total of fan votes will serve as the captains. They will then pick from the eight remaining starters first, then choose from the pool of players voted as reserves.

The captains' selections will be conducted before the full rosters are unveiled during a TNT program on Jan. 25.Hendrie Kruzen, assistant to former Borussia Dortmund coach Peter Bosz, has said they could have been more active in the transfer market.

Kruzen, 53, joined Dortmund from Ajax with Bosz in the summer, but the duo were sacked after an eight-game winless streak in the Bundesliga and a disappointing Champions League campaign.

Speaking to Dutch newspaper Tubantia, Kruzen said: "I wish them all the best. There are no hard feelings -- I don't want them to lose.

"I would have preferred to stay. They are one of the biggest clubs in the world -- you have to experience it. At a home game, you really say: 'Wow, Ajax is big, Dortmund is twice as big, there are 81,000 people in the stadium and there is a [season ticket] waiting list of 37,000 people.'"

Bosz and Kruzen tried to implement a very attacking style, with the approach bringing them a five-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga after seven matches.

But their form fell away and Kruzen said: "In the summer we were allowed to buy players but we decided that we wanted to get to know the team first.

"There were Champions League winners, you expect something from that. Ultimately, that approach was too conservative and we had to get players we thought would fit in.

"In the winter break, we would have opted for two central defenders and a striker. That says it all, really."

Kruzen pinpointed the injury suffered by defender Lukasz Piszczek while playing for Poland in October as a turning point, saying: "Even if it sounds strange, it went downhill after Lukasz Piszczek got injured.

"He encouraged his teammates, was enthusiastic, but then dropped out.

"Then I expected more from Sokratis [Papastathopoulos]. He was the vice-captain and had to show leadership. Instead, he left us hanging."

He indicated that the centre-back had not helped the players get on the same page as the coaching staff and said: "The goalkeeper and the defenders wanted a more defensive approach, the midfielders and attackers were pleased with our way and wanted to continue.

"We had a squad of 27 players -- that was too much. You field 11, the rest are almost always dissatisfied, the unrest increased and groups within the team emerged.

"Good results can hide a lot, but once results take a turn for the worse, then everyone focuses on the system and the physical condition of the players."

But Kruzen denied claims that Dortmund's players had not been fit enough and said: "Nonsense -- data doesn't lie. Compared to last year, it was the same or even better."

And he stressed that he was not bitter about his departure from the club, adding: "I do not stay in the negative, never. I've learned things, I'm going to take advantage of that."Brazilian legend Ronaldo sees similarities in the way Barcelona behaved during Neymar's summer transfer to Paris Saint-Germain and the way the Spanish giants conducted themselves when he left the Camp Nou.

Neymar joined PSG this summer in a world-record €222 million move, after which Barcelona sued the player for breach of contract and refused to pay him an outstanding bonus payment.

Speaking with Esporte Interativo, Ronaldo suggested that there has been a pattern of similar behaviour from Barcelona toward Brazilians who leave the Catalan club.

Ronaldo revealed that his then-world record $27 million move to Inter Milan in 1997 was a painful one, and that the same has been true for a number of his compatriots.

"I am much more grateful and attached to Real Madrid than to Barcelona, even though I maybe had my best year at Barcelona," said Ronaldo, who now works as a Real Madrid ambassador.

Ronaldo says he and Romario both had ugly Barcelona exits before Neymar's similar situation.

"But the end of my story with Barcelona was really bad, much like what's happened to Neymar now.

"This has been going on for a while. They did something similar with Romario, and after, did it with Ronaldinho as well."

Despite his bad experience leaving Barcelona, Ronaldo still has fond memories of Barcelona and still views considers it "an incredible city" and the football club a "fantastic" one.

Neymar currently boasts 11 goals and nine assists from 14 appearances in Ligue 1 alone, while he has scored six more and added three assists from six Champions League outings in a fruitful start to life at Parc des Princes.

Siete magistrados y 14 jueces de distrito, así como 55 subalternos de juzgados y tribunales de todo el país recibieron algún tipo de sanción durante 2017 por parte del Consejo de la Judicatura Federal (CJF).

Las sanciones impuestas a los funcionarios titulares van desde apercibimientos privados y amonestaciones hasta suspensión en siete casos y la destitución de un juez de Distrito. Al personal subalterno también le fueron impuestas sanciones semejantes.

Datos del CJF señalan que en el año que termina se castigó en total a 407 empleados judiciales. En el Registro de Servidores Públicos Sancionados se inscribieron 341 sanciones, incluidas las aplicadas por otros órganos disciplinarios del Poder Judicial de la Federación.

También en este año aumentaron los procedimientos de investigación ante las quejas y denuncias presentadas contra diversos funcionarios judiciales por presuntas irregularidades.

Reportes internos del CJF y de la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación, indican que en los últimos 12 meses se ordenó la realización de 290 procesos que, acumulados a los 94 existentes desde años anteriores, suman un total de 384 indagatorias.

Detectan irregularidades

Y es que durante 2017 aumentaron los procedimientos de investigación al interior del Poder Judicial de la Federación, ante quejas y denuncias presentadas por presuntas irregularidades por parte de diversos funcionarios judiciales.

Según reportes internos del CJF y de la Suprema Corte, en los últimos 12 meses se ordenó la realización de 290 procesos que, acumulados a los 94 existentes desde años anteriores, suman un total de 384.

Por ejemplo, en materia de anticorrupción, se determinó por primera vez en la historia del Consejo de la Judicatura Federal la primera sanción en contra de un particular en el marco de la Ley Federal Anticorrupción en Contrataciones Públicas, consistente en una inhabilitación por 10 años y la aplicación de una multa económica por 109 millones de pesos.

Complicidad

En abril pasado el CJF destituyó al magistrado federal José Guadalupe Luna Altamirano, quien fue acusado de vínculos con la delincuencia organizada y de mala impartición de la justicia por liberar a narcotraficantes.

Tras investigar las sentencias emitidas por Luna Altamirano, y detectar una serie de irregularidades en ellas, los consejeros resolvieron en sesión privada y por unanimidad separarlo definitivamente de su cargo como juzgador.

Apenas en abril, y tras tres años de indagatorias, se confirmó desde la SCJN la destitución del juez Luis Armando Jerezano Treviño, acusado de dictar sentencias irregulares que beneficiaron a casineros.

A principios de 2014 el juzgador fue denunciado ante la Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) por presunto enriquecimiento ilícito de alrededor de 28 millones de pesos. Además se le indaga en Estados Unidos por el delito de lavado de dinero.

De acuerdo con las indagatorias que llevaron a su destitución por el CJF, en agosto de 2015 Jerezano Treviño favoreció con sus fallos la operación de sitios de apuestas propiedad de Juan José Rojas Cardona, llamado El Zar de los Casinos.

Subalternos

En octubre, el CJF destituyó e inahibilitó por 20 años a tres funcionarios que usurparon funciones en el juzgado federal que dirigió durante siete meses el juez Vicente Bermúdez Zacarías, quien fue asesinado hace un año en Metepec, Estado de México.

Según las indagatorias de la Comisión de Disciplina del CJF, dos actuarias y un chofer del Juzgado Quinto de Distrito en Materia de Amparo y Juicios Federales, con sede en Toluca, incurrieron en irregularidades que fueron denunciadas en 2016 por el propio Bermúdez Zacarías, pues realizaron labores que no les correspondían en el penal de máxima seguridad de El Altiplano.

Se trata de Mayumi Guadalupe Sánchez, esposa del juez Jorge Arturo Porras Gutiérrez, antecesor de Bermúdez en el cargo. La actuaria interpuso, dos días después del homicidio de su jefe, un amparo para intentar evitar cualquier orden de aprehensión.

Die Bistümer horten weiter Milliarden – doch was genau mit dem Geld passiert, bleibt noch immer geheim. Nur eines ist klar: Bei den Mitarbeitern kommt nicht viel an.

Die katholische Kirche erhielt 2016 sechs Milliarden Euro Kirchensteuern, wie Erhebungen von Statista zeigen. Und das, obwohl seit der Jahrtausendwende 2,2 Millionen Menschen aus der Kirche ausgetreten sind, wie das "Handelsblatt" berichtet. Dank Wirtschaftsboom werden die Einnahmen aus der Kirchensteuer in diesem Jahr noch größer ausfallen. Geldsorgen hat die katholische Kirche also keine.

Das zeigt auch ein Blick in die Finanzen der 27 deutschen Bistümer. Die besitzen ein Vermögen von mehr als 26 Milliarden Euro. Doch was passiert mit dem Geld? Kommt es Bedürftigen zu Gute? Erhalten Mitarbeiter der Caritas mehr Gehalt - oder werden neue Kindergärten oder Krankenhäuser finanziert?

Bistümer horten Vermögen

Nein, nichts der Gleichen. Das Geld fließt nicht an Bedürftige oder Arbeitende. Stattdessen horten die Bistümer einen Großteil ihres Vermögens, wie eine Auswertung der Geschäftsbücher des Jahres 2015 zeigt. In welche Finanzanlagen sie investieren, bleibt unklar. Dabei hatte die katholische Kirche nach dem Skandal um das Luxusleben von Bischof Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst eine große Transparenzoffensive angekündigt. Stattdessen bleibt bislang alles wie gehabt: Die Kirche schweigt oder schwurbelt.

So fragte das "Handelsblatt" beim Finanzdirektor der Diözese Köln nach konkreten Investitionen. Die Antwort: "Bei der gegebenen globalen Ausrichtung ergeben sich [...] eine Vielzahl von Investitionsmöglichkeiten, so dass ich es für wenig sinnvoll halte, Ihnen nun den ein oder anderen Titel zu nennen."Im US-Bundesstaat Utah ist ein Lehrer entlassen worden, weil er seinen Schülern versehentlich ein 100 Jahre altes Aktgemälde zeigte. Eltern hatten sich beschwert, dass den 11-Jährigen "Pornografie" gezeigt wurde. Der Lehrer entschuldigte sich für die Verwechslung, wehrt sich jedoch gegen die Entlassung.

Demnach enthielt die Postkartensammlung Abbildungen berühmter Gemälde von Künstlern wie Vincent van Gogh , Paul Klee oder Claude Manet. Der Lehrer wollte mit der Klasse eigentlich nur über die Verwendung von Farben in der Kunst sprechen. Für Aufregung habe aber ein Aktgemälde des italienischen Malers Amedeo Modigliani gesorgt. Das Motiv kam auch für den Lehrer überraschend.

Wie die Zeitung "The Herald Journal" berichtete, war der Kern des Problems eine Sammlung von Postkarten klassischer Gemälde aus der Schulbücherei, die der Lehrer im Unterricht verwendete. Wie er erklärte, hatte er nicht damit gerechnet, dass die Sammlung, die seit Jahren im Besitz der Schule war, Aktgemälde enthielt. Er ist aber der Ansicht, sich in der Situation richtig verhalten zu haben.

Polizei kann keine "Pornografie" finden

"Einigen Schülern waren die Bilder unangenehm, also sammelte ich diejenigen Postkarten, die problematisch waren, sofort wieder ein", erklärte der Lehrer später auf Facebook. Dann habe er den etwa 11-jährigen Schülern erklärt, dass Kunst immer im Kontext gesehen werden muss und gerade der menschliche Körper sehr oft in Gemälden portraitiert wird – was auch unangenehm sein kann.

Einigen Eltern war das nicht genug. Laut "The Herald Journal" zeigten sie den Lehrer wegen der "Verbreitung von Pornografie" an. Wie sich die Polizei überzeugen konnte, war das nicht der Fall. Demnach war die Schulleiterin gerade dabei, alle Aktmotive aus der Postkartensammlung zu entfernen, als die Beamten eintrafen. Der Lehrer sei aber dennoch entlassen worden.

Lehrer will seinen Ruf verteidigen

Wie eine Mutter der Zeitung erklärte, gehe es eher darum, wie der Lehrer mit seinen Schülern gesprochen habe. Er habe ihren Sohn und andere Jungen herabgesetzt, als er sagte, sie sollen sich "nicht so anstellen und sich wie Erwachsene verhalten". Der Lehrer widersprach. Er habe nur gesagt, dass sie in Museen unweigerlich mit Nacktheit konfrontiert werden, wenn sie erwachsen sind.

Dennoch habe der Lehrer laut dem Zeitungsbericht seinen Fehler eingestanden, sich die Postkarten zuvor nicht genau angesehen zu haben. Gegen seine Entlassung wehre er sich jedoch. Die Vorwürfe würden seinen Namen beschmutzen. "Es geht nicht um Geld, es geht darum, dass meine Seite der Geschichte gehört wird und um mein Recht auf einen unbeschmutzten Namen, einen makellosen Ruf", erklärte er.

Auch viele Eltern teilen die Empörung über die "unanständigen" Aktgemälde nicht. Eine Mutter erklärte dem "Herald Journal": "Die Schule fragte in einer E-Mail bei den Eltern nach, ob ihre Kinder wegen der Vorkommnisse aufgebracht seien. Meiner Tochter war jedoch nichts davon unangenehm. Sie ist viel erschrockener darüber, dass ihr Lehrer wegen der Sache in Schwierigkeiten steckt."

Im Video: Nackte Kunstaktion in KZ-Gaskammern sorgt für Sturm der EntrüstungBuffon hails Harry Kane

By Football Italia staff

Gianluigi Buffon has his eye on the Champions League, but to get there Juventus must beat Tottenham and Harry Kane, "one of the best strikers in Europe."

The Juventus and Italy goalkeeper spoke to The Daily Mirror newspaper in England as he prepares to turn 40 next month and singled out Spurs hitman Kane.

"Harry is now one of the best strikers in ­Europe – there is no question about that. As a player, you can always work on parts of your game and try to ­improve – but there are some things you can't teach.

"That natural goal-scoring instinct is for me a talent that you are born with. I have seen over the years with Ronaldo, Cristiano Ronaldo, Pippo Inzaghi, Gabriel Batistuta, they have that natural instinct that can really make goalkeepers suffer – and it's clear Kane also has that.

"Always in my ­career I have wanted to test myself against the best – and now Harry Kane is one of the best. I have always had the attitude that I don't fear the best – I respect them – and I always want to play against them.

"That is one of the greatest ­challenges of playing at the highest level, to test yourself against the best players – that is always something I have enjoyed."

Kane has hit a remarkable 24 goals in 24 competitive games this season, including six in five Champions League appearances.

Buffon has said he is "99 per cent certain" he'll retire at the end of this season, but could hold off if Juventus win the Champions League, because it'll give him a chance to play in the Club World Cup.

In order to get there, they first need to get past Tottenham with the first leg of their Round of 16 tie on February 13.

"They are going to be two hard games against Tottenham – we know that. Kane will be a big threat but they are not just Kane.

"As always, it is my dream to win the Champions League – I don't allow it to be a pressure – but it still remains a big ambition."

This was evident with Black Lives Matter, among other movements. It's been evident for the past three days in Iran, where thousands have taken to streets and public squares calling for an end to the hardline conservative regime of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

The question that needs to be asked right now is why traditional mainstream media outlets – grandstanding over their importance in this new, bold era of fact-checking and truth-telling – have largely ignored a blossoming revolution.

Anyone on Twitter could click #IranProtests and view videos and eyewitness accounts that contradicted much of Western media's early reporting about these protests being simply about economic anxiety as was the case with The New York Times and Washington Post.

Anyone on Twitter could click #IranProtests and view videos and eyewitness accounts that contradicted much of Western media's early reporting about these protests being simply about economic anxiety as was the case with The New York Times and Washington Post.

But the now three-day duration of rallies and protests that have found their way to Tehran have gone largely unnoticed in America's corporate media apparatus. The New York Times simply described the protests as economic grievances, the same way Iranian state-run television described them.

CNN ignored the protests completely, and the explosion on social media until a front page story reporting on not uprisings against the regime, but a pro-government rally and President Trump's tweet in support of the protestors. If the State Department wants to send a message of solidarity to the protesters in Iran, perhaps it can send them a white truck. Yes, the question has to be asked how such an uprising of thousands against their government would be covered by western media if this were Tel Aviv. We don't need U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley defiantly raising her hand to answer that question for us.

The somewhat muted reaction to thousands of people rising up against the Iranian regime can and should be compared to the attention the Arab Spring received in 2010. The scenes coming out of Iran are just as dramatic, if not more so, than those of the Arab uprising.

A woman was caught on videotape screaming "death to Khamenei" at Iranian law enforcement officials – an action that could not only endanger her life, but the lives of her family. But nevertheless, she persisted.

Social media came to a halt when another video was shared on Twitter of a female activist, shedding her hijab and waving a makeshift flag at security forces while standing atop a container.

I'm not exactly sure why an Iranian woman would shed such a garment that we've been told by the political left of this country is a symbol of empowerment and feminism. But her body, her choice.

Protesters are shouting "Death to Khamenei," "Mullahs get lost," "No more Islamic Republic," "Clerics return us our country." They are not shouting "We have economic anxiety". This is not about economic anxiety. This about revolting against a regime who has exhausted its moral good will, and no longer can lean on a sympathetic United States for more pallets of cash.

There is no doubt that socio-economics are playing a small role in all this. That's bound to happen when a corrupt repressive regime promises its people millions of dollars to improve their lives, courtesy of their former friends in the Obama administration who flew them pallets of cash. Then somehow that money found its way to Syrian dictator Bashar Assad and terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah.

The echo chamber of media outlets that are now hesitant to report on the uprising in Iran cannot be ignored, especially after the coordinated lash-out on the heels of Josh Meyer's devastating report in Politico over the Obama administration killing an investigation into Hezbollah's drug trafficking operation. The Obama administration reportedly took the action to appease Iran and facilitate a nuclear deal.

Despite a near blackout, these protests are not intended for domestic Iranian audiences only.

How will the Obama Presidential Library wing look celebrating a nuclear deal with an oppressive Iranian regime that could possibly be deposed by security forces and the military joining with protesters, thirsty for democracy and a return to an Iran before the 1979 revolution?

More to the point, how will it look if the Trump administration, of all things, facilitates and encourages such change in Iran?

The prospect of this is not lost on the self-styled resistance and anti-Trump media, all too anxious to witness the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the Obama Library or hand a Nobel Prize to former Secretary of State John Kerry.

Overseeing the fall of an oppressive, hardline Iranian regime that sponsors terror all around the globe – followed by the rise of a democratic Iran not interested in aggression against its neighbors – would be a foreign policy victory for President Trump, one of the biggest for a president since the fall of the Berlin Wall.

If the Iranian regime is ousted, the move would neuter Hezbollah's primary source of funding. It would diminish Hamas at a time when the United States rightfully is moving its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem in defiance of the United Nations.

Replacement of the Iranian government could signal that Assad's days in Syria are finally coming to an end, without powerful bullies to back him up. A new Iranian government would also no doubt give Russia pause about meddling in Middle East affairs – a hesitancy it did not have when the Obama administration gave Russian President Vladimir Putin "flexibility."

Combative media reluctant to give President Trump credit for any policy victories – along with reluctance by anti-Trump analysts on the right (this one included) – should not divert our attention from Iranian citizens risking their lives to take to the streets. These Iranians hope the United States and the rest of the world do not ignore them again.Letters to the Editor Nunes forgets roots; respect voters or get out

Jorg Letkemann, left, and Valeria Ayala demonstrate outside Rep. Devin Nunes' office in Clovis. They and other activists want Congress to pass a bill that will allow so-called Dreamers stay in the United States without deportation. mmays@fresnobee.com

It's time to consider voting out Rep. Devin Nunes for his next term due to his investigation of the FBI and the Department of Justice,. We all know that he is a lackey to Donald Trump.

He refuses to meet with his constituents to explain what's going on in Washington, or our concerns, and he won't speak to the Bee. It appears that he is trying to obstruct justice by investigating the investigation of the FBI, to bring a close to the Russians and Trump.

Nunes appears to have his own agenda and seems to have forgotten whom he is supposed to represent. So when the time comes, please help replace Nunes with somebody who will represent us!

Who: Owen McCarthy, Principal Programmer at Frontier

My name is Owen Mc Carthy. I am a principal programmer for Frontier. I studied Computer Science and Theoretical Physics at University and did an MSc in Game Development at the University of Hull before joining Frontier nine years ago. I usually end up working on something physics or simulation related.

I worked on reactive water simulation and the physics in Kinectimals. I've worked with some really fun signal processing on Kinect Disneyland Adventures so we could map the player's movements to their in-game avatar with as little jitter and lag as possible. I then worked on building destruction and ragdolls for Screamride.

Most recently I worked on the crowd simulation in Planet Coaster. I really love building believable worlds, and game development is definitely the place to be to make that happen.

What: Building Believable Crowds in Planet Coaster

For Planet Coaster, we wanted to make the best-ever crowds in the SIM genre. That meant huge numbers, few intersections, and novel approaches to sound, art and animation.

In Planet Coaster's voxel-based sandbox we wanted to simulate 10,000 park guests at once and we wanted them to look like a real crowd. We also wanted them to be able to handle curved paths, which had proven a challenging task in crowd simulations from our previous games but something we considered essential to Planet Coaster.

Traditional pathfinding methods aren't suitable for simulating huge numbers of characters in real time. Usually each agent would compute a path separately and then move along it, but this tends to be very expensive and doesn't scale well. Trying to add collision avoidance afterward becomes a mess of edge case handling.

We use potential/flow fields to simulate the crowd in Planet Coaster. We have parallelized the computation across CPU cores and frame boundaries to minimize impact on the frame rate. We also had to implement non-standard approaches for sound, art and animation systems.

Why?

At the beginning of Planet Coaster's development we knew we wanted to move the genre forward. One thing I was particularly invested in was bringing the atmosphere of a real crowd into our virtual world, and in making each park guest aware of their surroundings. I wanted to capture little moments like walking by an entertainer doing silly things and seeing other guests watching and reacting.

We reviewed the state of the art in relation to crowd simulation and navigation. That involved reading lots of research papers, studying techniques and analyzing the feasibility of each one, taking into account scalability, memory usage and CPU performance. We watched hours of footage of crowds moving around theme parks, and we captured footage of our own.

10,000 guests was the number that we targeted right from the beginning, and simulating each one individually seemed like a real challenge, so we focused on a smaller number. There are fewer goals in a theme park than guests; rides, coasters, shops and facilities are all goals. This was where the technique of using flow/potential fields became very appealing.

Instead of computing a path from A to B for each person, a path from each goal to all possible positions is computed. The question was, 'can we simulate a few hundred goals in a flow simulation more cheaply than we could simulate 10,000 individual paths with something like the A* algorithm?'

Crowd flow

We had prototypes of several different Planet Coaster technologies in development in parallel. We started development on a voxel based landscape system, and we really wanted to break out of the traditional grid-based path system. Ultimately the crowd system would need to be integrated with the voxel terrain and path systems, but early in development they were still unknowns so the crowd system had to be robust enough to fit whatever these systems became. It was easier to develop this crowd prototype in isolation, but to be constantly aware of making it amenable to changes elsewhere.

The crowd system was much more robust as a result of this separation. Requests for changes to the path system throughout development were little to no work to integrate with the crowd system. The crowd system just deals with shapes to add to its flow simulation and it doesn't really can about the source of them. For example: During the first alpha we could only have straight elevating paths. It would have been possible to exploit this fact for ease of implementation of overlapping paths, but later on the designers wanted to have curving elevating paths and they implemented them they just worked fine with the crowd system and became a feature for the second alpha release!

I started creating a flow simulation on a flat grid-based system to begin with, but flow fields for each goal don't interact with each other directly. The interaction happens indirectly by resolving around a density and velocity field generated from all of the guests in the simulation. These flow fields exhibit many of the properties found in high density real crowds. They interact with each other and flow around each other and form emergent structures like lanes and congestion, and they allow agents to flow around congestion.

I think the best way to imagine how a flow simulation works is to picture a table with raised edges. Inside this table is your park and its network of paths, and each goal point has a different water tap connected to it. Scattered across the table are marbles which will flow with the water. When you want to solve a particular goal, you turn on that tap and watch the water flow through the path network and push the marbles around. Each tap can only move its set of marbles and other taps' marbles are frozen in place as obstacles.

We record the velocity of the 'water' every time it flows into a new cell on the table. Once the entire table is filled with water, you've effectively 'solved' the flow field away from that goal. Now you can reverse the direction of the flow, pick any point on that table and inspect the velocity of it, and it is now directing the particle to the goal!

You can now put as many agents as you like anywhere on that grid and you instantly know which way they need to move to get to that goal. You can keep this velocity field in memory until a new one is computed and continue to flow agents on the existing data.



Figure 1: In essence, you're propagating a wave through a grid and recording the velocity of a wave the first time it enters every cell.

When this prototype was up and running with really simple debug rendering and spheres for each guest, we needed to test the CPU and memory performance to see if this technique was viable at the scale we were aiming for. We built a stress test map with the same dimensions as the target map size. This map had a few hundred goals and about 10,000 agents on it. While memory usage was a little bit over budget, we were confident that eventually we could drastically reduce it. The CPU usage was heavy but the system was single-threaded at this point. We already had a vision to parallelize the simulation so that it wouldn't be a limiting factor.

Figure 2



Animation

It was now time to get rid of the debug rendering. The art team had already started taking the concept art and turning it into models we could use. Each guest was planned to have interchangeable body parts with lots of texture and skintone variation. We have a great animation team at Frontier, with lots of experience making quality animations, but due to the number of guests we needed to limit the animation blending that could take place.

Front-facing characters in game animations typically use bone space blending with many layered animations, which makes it expensive to compute the non linear final bone transformation. Instead of this we store the bone transformations from every frame (not keyframe) of the animation in memory and use a simple linear interpolation of the nearest two frames. This leads to simpler-looking animations, but we felt we could do better and still be efficient with clever authoring and cross-fading.

Crossfading is a much cheaper model-space linear blend between two different transforms, but can cause skeleton constraints to be broken, so we have to be very careful when we cross fade. We authored a lot of the animations with the legs in lockstep with each other so the upper body was free to do other things, and we could crossfade at any point in the walk cycle animation to another reaction animation without the legs crossing, losing momentum or sliding. This allowed us to benefit from bone-space blending quality transitions, without all the computation expense that goes with it.

We also wanted to have lots of variation in the animations and didn't want the guests to look repetitive, which is harder to do when blending is limited. The animators were already busy recording footage of how people move as individuals and in groups, so we analyzed this footage and were able to break down the animation cycle into a very modular system. We settled for four or five variants of the base walk cycle, each under two seconds long. Every time one of these animations was finished, we were able to transition to another without blending, and build up a very dynamic and long walk cycle.

We also had a suite of animations for awareness, needs and feelings – tired, fed up, pointing, laughing, needing the toilet etcetera – that we could plug into the animation timeline when the guests are reacting to things in the park. By the time Planet Coaster shipped I think we had upwards of eight minutes of animations per skeleton type we could plug into this system.

Figure 3:

We also spent some time looking at how the guests would behave in a group or family. Due to the nature of flow fields, you can't easily ensure different particles will stay together even if they are going to the same goal, as the flow dictates where each individual particle moves. The solution was to put groups into a single particle in the simulation and move them as one unit. Each group has a radius within which members can move without affecting the flow simulation. Originally the family members were locked in formation but this looked very odd, especially when they turned corners, so we programmed in more freedom so they could rotate individually inside the particle so the relative positions of family members would move and shift over time for a more convincing look.

Audio

At this point we could see our prototype was going to be the way forward. The large number of guests was becoming a reality so we had to think about how things were going to sound. Traditionally with video game sounds, you usually put a sound emitter on each object/guest that would make a sound, but with 10,000 guests it would sound chaotic and would be prohibitively expensive.

We wanted to get a very accurate representation of the crowd ambience, and Frontier's sound designers were already thinking of building a coarse representation of the density of a crowd and their emotions for this purpose. With the flow simulation we already had crowd density data available for the general crowd ambiance. We could then layer 'fine detail' audio on top of the crowd ambience so the members of the crowd nearest to the camera would have distinct sounds and conversations, which really brought the guests to life.

Further challenges

By this time the path system prototype's development had finished and we had chosen a crowd system to go with. The next big challenge was how this crowd prototype would work with the voxel-based terrain and the curved/elevated paths instead of a traditional heightmap. With Planet Coaster's voxel terrain and free path system, you can overlap paths and terrain on top of one another, making it more complicated than the simple 'table' prototype.

To combat this we decided to break up the grids into much smaller chunks and connect them with virtual connections. The large grid in the prototype image in Figure 2 would be broken up into smaller 4m x 4m grids. To make the entire terrain traversable would require enormous amounts of memory as each distinct goal needs a persistent record of the velocities of each cell, but by only allowing guests to navigate paths we only need smaller grid segments to exist when there is a path in that area, keeping memory usage down.

Each path section would be rasterized to these smaller grid segments, activating cells in them and creating new segments when necessary. When a cell is activated the height of the path is also computed at that point, so each grid also has a heightmap. This meant that when we needed to set the height of the particles it was a quick lookup into the heightmap, instead of raycasting into the voxel terrain. Doing 10,000 raycasts every frame into the voxel terrain to determine the height of each guest was something we wanted to avoid!

The connections between grid segments were very hard to visualize when dealing with overlapping paths, but hopefully you can understand it after looking at the picture below which shows the debug rendering of the grid segments and virtual connections.

Figure 4: The red lines are connections between cells, and the inactive cells in the grid segments have slashes through them. Each grid segment is a 4x4 block of cells

The connections were probably the most difficult part of the simulation to get right as it adds a lot of overhead to the data structures that has to be precisely maintained when paths are added and removed. The 'Undo' and 'Redo' feature of Planet Coaster is something often taken for granted, but in this game it was something we really thought would improve the user experience. This most intuitive feature for players required a massive development effort to implement into Planet Coaster's freeform sandbox. All the game systems had to work with Undo / Redo from the beginning. The crowd system's add/remove path operations had to be well defined and processed so that adding and removing the same piece of path would leave the crowd system's data structures in the same state as before, adding further complexity to the maintenance of the virtual connections between the grids.

Scaling up

Now we were at the point where we could build path networks in the game, it was time to scale up the simulation. We needed to optimize! Usually optimization happens near the end of a project, but with a system as intensive as ours we needed to tackle it much earlier. The three important points about flow fields that enabled us to optimize them for very little impact on the framerate are:

Flow fields don't need to be updated every frame. Particles continue to flow on the front buffer of the velocity field until a new flow field is generated on the back buffer, and when it is finished computing the buffers are swapped. Each flow field update is independent of the other updates. This means we can run different ones at the same time, and we don't rely on locking any data structures or complicated synchronization behavior. The updates are not tied to the frame boundaries and can run across them. The tasks can also yield and let higher priority work execute.

This created some confusion in the player community during our Alpha period, as players would see their CPU usage get close to 100 percent on all cores in task manager and think that the game demanded a better CPU, but the reality was that the crowd system was scaling to take full advantage of idle CPU time to update the flow fields faster, which leads to higher fidelity for collisions between particles. On a slower system it would just take a few more frames to do a full update of all the goals. We even discovered that some users were using systems where their CPU cooling wasn't actually sufficient to run the CPU under a constant full load.

Figure 5:

Some of the major technical difficulties we overcame were caused by gridlock. When you have thousands of guests walking on paths and they want to go in opposite directions, lanes will usually form. Unfortunately, lanes sometimes won't have enough time to form and gridlock will develop. When this happens during events in major cities, nobody is able to move until a police officer or another influencer directs some people to move and others to stay still. It's realistic but it's not fun, so we implemented a novel solution to combat gridlock. The longer guests are in head-on collisions with other guests, the smaller their collision radius would become until they could fit through the gaps. This meant that the guests would clip more often, but it stopped the gridlock problem and limited clipping only to areas of very high congestion.

Even now, there are still areas for improvement – for example 'dead zones'. It's possible with potential fields to have areas of the field where the velocity is precisely zero. This manifested as a problem with Janitors cleaning up trash. All of the trash pieces would be part of the same goal and were only one flow computation, but this easily led to situations where a janitor could be caught between two pieces of trash. To work around this, each janitor would only activate the nearest piece of trash to them, and only the active pieces of trash were part of the goal in the flow computation.

Entertainers simply create goals when they are entertaining so guests can go towards and watch them. Bins create goals when they are empty and remove them when they are full. For incidental goals like this as an optimization we were able to limit how far the wave can propagate. This limitation saved lots of memory as we only needed to store a much smaller velocity field.

Result

We were now at the point where we could have hundreds of goals and thousands of guests walking around, all avoiding each other and moving in a manner close to the final fluid and dynamic result you can see in the game.

There are several other systems and techniques we used that are beyond the scope of this article and I could probably write a full feature on each of them but I really hope this article gives you a good insight as to how we went about designing and implementing this system at Frontier for Planet Coaster. More than anything, I really hope it makes people smile when they play the game at home and realize that their park guests are having as much fun in the park as the player has making it, and I hope players enjoy all the new gameplay opportunities that realistic crowd flow and congestion play in the design of their parks.

Pyrotechnic workers dangling from harnesses are busy scaling Seattle's Space Needle this weekend to install thousands of fireworks that will launch from the 605 foot structure to ring in the New Year on Sunday night. An estimated 20,000 spectators will be at the Space Needle, with as many as 400,000 expected to watch the show from surrounding neighborhoods.

GeekWire caught up with Ian Gilfillan, executive vice president of Pyro Spectaculars, Inc. to get a glimpse of the preparation and technology behind the show. "We have almost 2000 firing commands, and on each of those firing commands, is anywhere from one to as many as 100 items," said Gilfillan.

There are two computers that fire the show from locations on the Space Needle, both listening to a broadcast timecode to keep the fireworks in sync with the musical soundtrack. According to Gilfillan, this year's music is being curated by KEXP with tributes to artists that have passed away this year.

Although the Space Needle is undergoing a major renovation project, the New Year's fireworks show will remain largely unchanged. "The show will look very much like it always has been. It's the same size, same length, same number of shots, that sort of thing " said Gilfillan. "One area, the halo, that we've been able to utilize in the past, we can't utilize this year, simply because construction is going on and there is a tarp hung around the top of the Space Needle."

The forecast looks dry for the fireworks show on Sunday night, though a bit on the cold side, so bundle up. Based on our experience last year, New Year's revelers should position themselves upwind to have a better view away from the fireworks smoke.Most web browsers come with a built-in password manager, a basic tool to save login data to a database and fill out forms and/or sign in to sites automatically using the information that is in the database.

Users who want more functionality rely on third-party password managers like LastPass, KeePass or Dashlane. These password managers add functionality, and may install as browser extensions or desktop programs.

Research from Princeton's Center for Information Technology Policy suggest that newly discovered web trackers exploit password managers to track users.

The tracking scripts exploit a weakness in password managers. What happens is the following according to the researchers:

A user visits a website, registers an account, and saves the data in the password manager. The tracking script runs on third-party sites. When a user visits the site, login forms are injected in the site invisibly. The browser's password manager will fill out the data if a matching site is found in the password manager. The script detects the username, hashes it, and sends it to third-party servers to track the user.

The following graphic representation visualizes the workflow.

The researchers analyzed two different scripts designed to exploit password managers to get identifiable information about users. The two scripts, AdThink and OnAudience, inject invisible login forms in web pages to retrieve username data that is returned by the browser's password manager.

The script computes hashes and sends these hashes to third-party servers. The hash is used to track users across sites without the use of cookies or other forms of user tracking.

User tracking is one of the holy grails of online advertising. Companies use the data to create user profiles that record user interests based on a number of factors, for example based on the sites visited -- Sports, Entertainment, Politics, Science -- or from where a user connects to the Internet.

The scripts that the researchers analyzed focus on the username. Nothing is keeping other scripts from pulling password data as well however, something that malicious scripts have tried already in the past.

The researchers analyzed 50,000 websites, and found no traces of password dumping on any of them. They did find the tracking scripts on 1,100 of the top 1 million Alexa websites however.

The following scripts are used:

AdThink: https://static.audienceinsights.net/t.js

OnAudience: http://api.behavioralengine.com/scripts/be-init.js

AdThink

The Adthink script contains very detailed categories for personal, financial, physical traits, as well as intents, interests and demographics.

The researchers describe the functionality of the script in the following way:

The script reads the email address and sends MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 hashes to secure.audiencesights.net. Another request sends the MD5 hash of the email address to the data broker Acxiom (p-eu.acxiom-online.com)

Internet users can check the status of tracking and opt out of the collecting of data on this page.

OnAudience

The OnAudience script is "most commonly present on Polish websites".

The script computes the MD5 hash of email addresses, and also other browser data commonly used for fingerprinting (MIME types, plugins, screen dimensions, language, timezone information, user agent string, OS and CPU information). Another hash is generated based on the data.

Protection against login form web tracking

Users can install content blockers to block requests to the domains mentioned above. The EasyPrivacy list does that already, but it is easy enough to add the URLs to the blacklist manually.

Another defense is the disabling of login data auto-filling. Firefox users can set the preference about:config?filter=signon.autofillForms to false to disable autofilling.

Closing Words

Is the advertisement publishing industry shoveling its own grave? Invasive tracking scripts are yet another reason for users to install ad and content blockers in web browsers.

Yes, this site has ads as well. I wish there was another option to run an independent site, or a company that would offer native advertisement solutions that run only on the server a site runs on, and does not require third-party connections or use tracking.

You can support us through Patreon, PayPal, or by leaving a comment / spreading the word on the Internet.

When you say you mostly do bugfixing now, seven kinds of new features will crawl under your bed and bite your silly toes off. If we were to come up with a short summary for 2017, it would be along those very lines.

So yes, we ended up with more new features that, however, make GIMP faster and improve workflows. Here's just a quick list of the top v2.10 parole violators: multi-threading via GEGL, linear color space workflow, better support for CIE LCH and CIE LAB color spaces, much faster on-canvas Warp Transform tool, complete on-canvas gradients editing, better PSD support, metadata viewing and editing, under- and overexposure warning on the canvas.

All of the above features (and many more) are available in GIMP 2.9.8 released earlier this month. We are now in the strings freeze mode which means there will be very few changes to the user interface so that translators could safely do their job in time for the v2.10 release.

Everyone is pretty tired of not having GIMP 2.10 out by now, so we only work on bugs that block the v2.10 release. There are currently 25 such bugs. Some are relatively easy to fix, some require more time and effort. Some have patches or there is work in progress, and some need further investigation. We will get there faster, if more people join to hack on GIMP.

Speaking of which, one thing that has changed in the GIMP project for the better this year is the workload among top contributors. Michael Natterer is still responsible for 33% of all GIMP commits in the past 12 months, but that's a ca. 30% decrease from the last year. Jehan Pagès and Ell now have a 38% share of all contributions, and Øyvind Kolås tops that with his 5% thanks to the work on layers blending/compositing and linear color space workflow in GIMP.

In particular, Ell committed the most between 2.9.6 and 2.9.8, implemented on-canvas gradients editing, introduced other enhancements, and did a lot of work on tuning performance in both GIMP and GEGL. We want to thank him especially for being the most prolific developer of GIMP for this last development release!

Another increasingly active contributor in the GEGL project is Debarshi Ray who uses the library for his project, GNOME Photos. Debarshi focused mostly on GEGL operations useful for digital photography such as exposure and shadows-highlights, and did quite a lot of bugfixing. We also got a fair share of contributions from Thomas Manni who added some interesting experimental filters like SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) and improved existing filters.

Changes in GEGL and babl in 2017 included (but are not limited to) 15 new filters, improvements in mipmap processing and multi-threading computations, a video editing engine called gcut, more fast paths to convert pixel data between various color spaces, support for custom RGB primaries and TRC, ICC color profiles parsing and generation, and numerous bugfixes.

At least some of the work done by Øyvind Kolås on both GEGL, babl, and GIMP this year was sponsored by you, the GIMP community, via Patreon and Liberapay platforms. Please see his post on 2017 crowdfunding results for details and consider supporting him. Improving GEGL is crucial for GIMP to become a state-of-the art professional image editing program. Over the course of 2017, programming activity in GEGL and babl increased by 120% and 102% respectively in terms of commits, and we'd love to see the dynamics keep up in 2018 and onwards.

Even though the focus of another crowdfunded effort by Jehan Pagès and Aryeom Han is to create an animated short movie, Jehan Pagès contributed roughly 1/5 of code changes this year, fixing bugs, improving painting-related features, maintaining GIMP official Flatpak, and these statistics don't even count the work on a much more sophisticated animation plug-in currently available in a dedicated Git branch. Hence supporting this project results in better user experience for GIMP users. You can help fund Jehan and Aryeom on Liberapay, Patreon or Tipeee. You can also read their end-of-2017 report.

We also want to thank Julien Hardelin who has been a great help in updating the user manual for upcoming v2.10, as well as all the translators and people who contributed patches. Moreover, we thank Pat David for further work on the new website, and Michael Schumacher for tireless bug triaging. They all don't get nearly as much praise as they deserve.

Happy 2018!ZUG, SWITZERLAND, Dec. 30, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WINGS Foundation (wingsfoundation.ch) today announced a strategic engagement with Aurora Labs S.A. (auroradao.com), developers of a decentralized, Ethereum-based crypto-banking and financial platform. With this engagement all ICOs participating in the WINGS crowd evaluation process will be listed on Aurora's decentralized exchange, IDEX (idex.market), immediately after launch. Additionally, the next 50 companies to raise over $5 million using WINGS for ICO price forecasting and evaluation will receive one DVIP token each. DVIP is an IDEX membership that entitles the token holder to three years of free trades on IDEX, as well as a host of other benefits.



"IDEX solves a key issue with Ethereum-based tokens, which is scaling for near real-time trading transactions as traders retain custody," said Dominik Zynis, Head of Communications for WINGS Foundation. "We recognize access to IDEX is a value-add for ICOs and token holders, and are excited to provide this benefit to our community."

"WINGS has a proven track record of predicting pricing for assets prior to completion of an ICO," said Alex Wearn, CEO of Aurora. "We believe companies that find success on WINGS are good candidates for the IDEX community, as each project is reviewed by several hundred people incentivized to ensure projects meet community standards of quality."

IDEX is the only decentralized exchange with real-time trading. In addition to free trades, each DVIP includes 50,000 AURA tokens, the proof-of-stake network token of the Aurora platform. AURA stakers are rewarded with trade fees from IDEX and other Aurora products for their role in securing the network. Teaming up with WINGS to provide a decentralized trading platform will give these new tokens an advanced exchange on which to grow their network. ICOs that have taken advantage of the WINGS price discovery platform include Fan Controlled Football League, Latium, Hacken, Gladius, Domraider, Bancor, and AdEx.

As part of the engagement Aurora will use WINGS for forecasting how many DVIP tokens will be sold in their ongoing token sale. WINGS community members who participate in the forecast will have a chance to be rewarded with 1.5 percent of the total AURA tokens created giving them a stake in the future growth of Aurora and IDEX.

Rare Wondrous Item

Usually made by wizards to sell, these candies have magical properties once ingested, unless otherwise stated. Putting a candy in your mouth and/or swallowing takes a bonus action.

Dragondrops Comes in 5 colors. Red (Fire, Strawberry Flavor) Black (Acid, Licorice Flavor) Blue (Lightning, Blueberry Flavor) Green (Poison, Lime Flavor) and White (Cold, Coconut Flavor). Once swallowed, the creature may use an action to breath dragon breathe corresponding to the color dragondrop he ate. Each dragondrop deals 4d8 damage of the corresponding type, or half on a success. Each drop allows only one dragon breathe. Black, Blue- 30ft line (Dex save, 14) Red, White, Green- 15ft cone (con save, 14)

Taffy Rope When bitten into, can stretch up to a maximum size of 150 feet. Can only hold 100 pounds before it breaks.

Candy Geyser When ingested, 300 gallons of water pour from the creature's mouth. Every turn, 30 gallons of water pours out in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. It has disadvantage to all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. As a bonus action, it may turn to aim at a creature. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone.

Candy Cane Shank After being in the mouth of a creature for 12 seconds (2 turns), the candy cane acts like a +1 dagger. In addition, it may be used to attack as a bonus action. The candy cane breaks after 1 minute.

5-pound Gummy Bear Eating part of of this gummy bear feeds you for the entire day, but you have -1 on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for 24 hours. The part you ate regenerates at dawn. After eating a part of the gummy bear, you gain 1d6 pounds.

Sugar Free Gummy Bears 1d6 hours after ingesting, the consumer has massive diarrhea. He or she becomes poisoned, stunned, and frightened for 2d4 hours. They take 1d4 fire damage and 1d4 psychic damage every hour.

Adhesive Gum Once chewed for 6 seconds, the user may use the gum as an adhesive, attaching two objects together. To detach the items, one must succeed on a DC 15 Athletics Check.

Life Savers If this candy is in your mouth when you fall to 0 hp, you are automatically stabilized. The candy dissolves in 1 minute.

Pixie Dust When ingested, the user's speed increases by 10 for 1 minute, and the user has disadvantage on any checks made to retain or recall knowledge.

Cotton Candy When ingested, the creature turns into strands of cotton. It may move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. It cannot cast spells or attack. It takes a perception check of 18 to notice the creature. Any damage it takes is doubled. This effect lasts for 1 minute.

Chocolate Rabbit This rabbit is alive. It acts in every way like a rabbit. It uses Rat statistics. It is a construct.

Iron Hide When held in a creature's mouth, the creature has a natural armor of 13 + Dexterity modifier. After 1 minute, the Iron Hide dissolves in the creature's mouth, ending the effect. Spitting or swallowing the Ironhide causes its effects to end.Tonight against the Memphis Grizzlies, Stephen Curry made 10 three-pointers, a season high for the entire league, and they came impressively in the flow of the normal Warriors offense. I mean, the guy only took 17 shots!

One of the highlights was a between-the-legs pass from Pachulia for a corner 3. I asked him about this in our interview a couple weeks ago (you should read the whole thing, part 1 and part 2):

EA: I've noticed that you've been passing the ball between your legs a lot this year. Is that something you're doing just for the joy of it, or is there a basketball reason? What do the coaches think? ZP: The true basketball reason, honestly, is I find it easier to release the ball a little earlier, and then I have time to set a good screen on my guy, you know whoever my guy is coming off. So, at the same time, fans like it. [laughs] I don't know. People like it, and they'll put it on social media. But I'm not trying to be fancy or anything. I'm trying to stay disciplined and be who I am and play this game the right way. So, who cares how you pass it between your legs, the handoff, or overhead. As long as the ball gets delivered to the right guy at the right place and it leads to an easy shot. That's what it's about. It looks fancy out there, because not everyone is doing it, but for me I'm just happy to get my guy open with a wide open shot.

Under the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), four organs, namely the kidneys, liver, heart and corneas, can be recovered in the event of death for transplantation... 13 Nov 2018









HOTA mockup

1. What is the Human Organ Transplant Act?

Under the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), four organs, namely the kidneys, liver, heart and corneas, can be recovered in the event of death for transplantation. The organs will give patients with organ failure another chance at life.

All Singaporeans and Permanent Residents who turn 21 years of age and who are not mentally disordered will be covered under the Act. Those who choose to remain under HOTA will have a higher priority in receiving an organ if they need a transplant in future.

2. How will I be informed of the Act?

All Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who turn 21 years of age will receive an introductory letter from MOH informing them about HOTA and their responsibilities under the Act. They will also be informed that they can opt out if they object to donation of their organ(s) upon death. The public will also be informed of HOTA through periodic advertisements in the newspapers and on television.

3. What if I do not feel comfortable being covered under the Act?

If you want to opt out of HOTA, you can download and complete the "Objection to Organ Removal under Section 9(1)" form on the Liveonwebsite or MOH's website and send it to the National Organ Transplant Unit. You can also opt out of donating specific organs. Should you change your mind about opting out, you should complete the "Withdrawal of Objection to Organ removal under Section 11(1)" form found here to indicate your choices.

4. What is brain death? What has brain death got to do with HOTA and organ transplant and how is brain death certified?

Under HOTA, stringent clinical criteria and steps must take place before organ recovery: the deceased must be certified brain dead before retrieval of organs can proceed.



Brain death is diagnosed only when there is catastrophic irreversible brain injury. When brain death has occurred, blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain ceases irreversibly and all brain functions are lost and will never return again. Once diagnosed it is recognised both medically and legally as death of the person in Singapore.



Brain death is determined according to strict clinical criteria. The neurological criteria for diagnosing brain death in Singapore are based on current best medical evidence and knowledge and are similar to those adopted by other countries such as USA, Australia, and UK. For organ donors, two independent doctors who are not involved in the care of the patient are required to certify brain death. Doctors accredited to certify brain death in our hospitals are specialists who have had appropriate training.

5. When a patient is declared brain dead, how are are family members of the deceased informed about organ donation?

After brain death has been certified, the attending doctor will meet up with the family to inform them of the patient's medical status. After which, the patient's status as an organ donor would be verified against the Organ Donor Registry. If the patient has not objected to organ donation previously, in accordance to HOTA, the wishes of the patient to donate his or her organ after death must be upheld.

The hospital and healthcare team deeply empathise with the family members who have lost their loved ones. In situations where families have expressed concerns about the donation of organs by the deceased, healthcare professionals (transplant coordinators, social workers, and medical team) would attend to their concerns, clarify any related issues that they may have, explain the legal requirements under HOTA and the process involved, as well as provide emotional support and active counselling to the family.

6. What if I want to do more than what HOTA prescribes?

The Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act (MTERA) is an opt-in scheme, where people can pledge to donate their organs and tissues (e.g. lung, bone, skin, heart valves, etc) for the purposes of transplantation, education or research after they pass away.

This article is accurate as of Aug 2013.(TNS) — WASHINGTON — When John Muir helped establish the National Park Service, he argued that such parks were vital to help people unplug from the world. "Break clear away, once in a while, and climb a mountain or spend a week in the woods," Muir was quoted as saying in 1915.

But these days at Yosemite National Park, hikers to Half Dome are likely to encounter people talking on cellphones as they climb to the top. For visitors to the parks, the call of the outdoors increasingly comes with crisp 4G service, and not everyone is wild about that.

In Yosemite, Yellowstone, Mount Rainier and other iconic parks, environmentalists are pressing the National Park Service to slow or halt construction of new cellular towers within park boundaries. They say the NPS is quietly facilitating a digital transformation with little public input or regard to its mission statement — to preserve "unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System."

Richard Louv, author of several books on connecting young people with the outdoors, said the parks are losing what once made them unique.

"Can you imagine hiking in Yosemite far from other people, and then suddenly it sounds like you are in McDonald's, with everyone on their phones?" said Louv, author of "Last Child in the Woods" and other books. "That is not why most people go to our national parks."

Yet advocates for increased cell service, including many NPS officials, say the parks can't cling to an earlier era. Expanded cellular and broadband coverage, they argue, helps rescue teams respond to emergencies and are necessary to draw a new generation to the parks.

"Visitors want to be able to use their mobile devices to share experiences with their friends and family," said Lena McDowall, an NPS deputy director, in testimony to a U.S. Senate subcommittee in September. "They want to take advantage of the many internet-based resources we have developed."

Locked in competition, Verizon, AT&T and other telecom companies are aggressively courting the most popular national parks, and under the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, the parks are obligated to at least review proposals for new cellular towers. Yet because the National Park Service is highly decentralized, NPS headquarters does not track construction of cellular towers in parks nationwide. Nor has it developed a national policy to guide parks superintendents in reviewing such proposals.

Yosemite has one park that has come under scrutiny for its expansion of cell service. In October, using public records request, the watchdog group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility found that Yosemite has quietly approved six cellular towers in the park.

PEER, which has asked the Interior Department's Inspector General to investigate, said that Yosemite is in "violation of both federal laws and agency policies" by approving the towers without public notice or environmental review. The group also unearthed emails that suggest that Yosemite officials are uncertain about ownership of five of the towers and how revenues should be handled when telecom companies co-locate on the towers.

In an email, Yosemite spokesman Scott Gediman said he was aware of PEER's complaint, but could not immediately comment. Jeffrey Olson, a spokesman for NPS headquarters in Washington, also declined to discuss the Yosemite case, other than to note that "decisions about cell towers and coverage are up the (park) superintendents."

Juggling public demands has always been difficult in the national parks, especially those that draw big crowds and include large expanses of designated wilderness. In 2016, the NPS reported a record 331 million visits to the parks, many of which suffer from overcrowding in the summer.

For the last year, Mount Rainier National Park in Washington state has been weighing whether to allow three telecom companies to co-locate a cellular facility at the park's Paradise visitor center.

Public opinion appears divided on the plan, which would extend cell service to some, but not all, of the mountain. Of those who commented on the proposal, 249 were supportive and 241 were opposed.

In North Dakota, wilderness advocates strongly opposed Verizon's plan to build a new cell tower at Theodore Roosevelt National Park, fearing it would blanket the backcountry with cell signals. NPS officials ultimately decided to design the new cell tower so it would not extend service into the park's designated wilderness.

Heidi Flato, a spokeswoman with Verizon, said the company is aware that some wilderness advocates have concerns with expanded cell coverage. "We've always sought to work with the National Park Service to find the right balance," said Flato, noting that a major complaint of park visitors is being unable to get a signal.

Over the last decade, PEER has emerged as the fiercest opponent of telecom expansion in Yosemite, Yellowstone and other national parks. The nonprofit group is led by lawyer Jeff Ruch, who keeps a close eye on the special use permits the national parks issues for new services and concessions.

Under National Park Service guidelines, such "special uses" are encouraged if they enhance park resources or improve public safety. But such uses should be rejected, the NPS says, if they "unreasonably disrupt the atmosphere of peace and tranquility of wilderness."

Ruch argues the park service rarely grapples with these tradeoffs when it is approached by cellular providers. "A telecom company will come to a park and say, "Nice mountain. We want to put a cell tower on it.' And the park usually says yes."

U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, a Democrat who represents the north coast of California, said he doesn't support physical construction of cell towers in wilderness areas. But he sees no problem with telecom companies improving signal strength near visitor centers, park entrances and even into the back country.

Huffman has introduced legislation, The Public Lands Telecommunications Act, that would allow parks and federal land agencies to keep the rental income they receive from granting right-of-way to cellular towers. They then could use that money to partner with nearby rural communities on improving their cellular and broadband service.

PEER opposes the legislation, arguing it would create incentives for more construction of cell towers on public lands. But Huffman said that districts like his, with remote communities scattered amid a patchwork of federal lands, need help in improving communications, partly for public safety reasons.

"This shouldn't be an issue," said Huffman. "If you want to avoid distractions in the wilderness, you can just turn off your phone. But you might also want to be able to turn on that phone and make a call if you broke your arm and needed help."

First responders and other safety officials agree that enhanced cell service helps in many outdoor rescues. But the issue is complicated, said Derek Newbern, a spokesman for King County Explorer Search and Rescue in Washington state.

Telecom companies, he said, can only go so far in expanding cell coverage to wilderness areas, because of lack of roads and electrical transmission lines. And yet when many people go into the back country, they often assume they will continue to have a cell signal, creating a false sense of security.

In August, hundreds of rescuers spent days trying to locate a lost hiker at Mount Teneriffe, a 4,787-foot-high mountain east of Seattle. The hiker initially had cell service, then lost it and wandered before a search helicopter rescued her four days later.

Newbern said he advises adventurers to carry personal locator beacons or a more recent innovation, satellite messengers, in case they get in trouble.

"People will go into the backcountry and think the cellphone will be their savior," said Newbern. "Sometimes it doesn't turn out that way."

I still haven't figured out what his sidekick Metagame does.

As far as using the power of retcon in a real game, I'm not sure I've ever pulled it off successfully. The problem is that you've got to have player buy-in, and breaking the flow of story (Never mind! None of that happened!) is a surefire way to lose player buy-in.

Case in point, I recently made a bad call in a Pathfinder game. It was a near-TPK, and only one little gnome was left un-petrified. A bunch of evil medusae were closing in, and the heroic gnome was feverishly trying to drag his stone buddies onto the group's teleporting magic carpet. After a desperate series of potions, alchemical items, and Strength checks, he'd mostly succeeded. However, the party's petrified cavalier was still sitting atop his petrified mount. Only two of the mount's feet were on the carpet. When the carpet did its thing, I ruled that the cavalier got left behind.

Now if I'd handled it better, that sequence of events could have made for an interesting scenario. Suffice it to say that the way I described the scene was less than awesome. My players felt as if they'd been put into a no-win situation, robbed of their agency, and killed by GM fiat. That's not really the point though. Once I realized that my players had crossed into not-having-fun territory, I tried to use the power of retcon to patch things up.

"OK guys. Clearly you're not satisfied with that call. Let's talk. How do you think it should have gone?"

We spent the next twenty minutes rattling off options. Maybe there was a teleporter mishap? We could put the cavalier in some random quarter of the dungeon. Or what if we went back and replayed the scene? Why not go full retcon and just say the cavalier got taken along after all? None of that happened though. After much discussion, the group decided to stick with the original call. I've said it before, but nobody wants an asterisk next to their character's name. Even if it was a bad call, there's something to be said for letting the ruling on the field stand. I just hope the captured-by-evil-snake-ladies cavalier feels the same!

What about you guys? Have you ever used the power of retcon in-game? Did it work for you? Tell us your tales of wibbly wobbly, timey wimey continuity in the comments!

Scotland in Union said it had reported the matter to the police and information watchdogs.

The names, addresses, emails, home and mobile phone numbers of hundreds of confirmed and potential donors were leaked at the weekend to pro-independence websites.

Scotland in Union now faces a possible investigation and sanction by the UK Information Commissioner's Office, which enforces the safe handling of personal data.

Wings Over Scotland, the Nationalist website run by controversial Bath-based blogger Stuart Campbell, posted redacted images of a donor spreadsheet showing dates and amounts.

Mr Campbell claimed several members of the aristocracy were among those giving money to Scotland in Union, but did not name them.

He later removed the images after receiving a letter from lawyers acting on behalf of Scotland in Union, which he said "made all manner of dire threats, some serious and some farcical".

The Yes-supporting Bella Caledonia website also said it had received the "data dump", which it said was full of the rich and landed classes, describing it as "like Debrett's on speed-dial".

Scotland in Union was set up shortly after the 2014 independence referendum in order to resist a second vote on the constitution.

The cross-party group has a reputation for lavish events and elite backers, raising around £350,000 from a £250-a-plate dinner at Edinburgh's Prestonfield House Hotel in 2016.

With guide prices up to £12,500, auction lots on the night included stays at private safari lodges in Kenya and Botswana, French and Swiss skiing chalets, a polo festival in India, and a plethora of deer stalking, fishing and grouse shooting events in the Highlands.

There was also a £100-a-ticket raffle to win a Mini Cooper convertible, a VIP tour of the Rangers FC training facility and seats in a director's box courtesy of Paul Murray, and a signed copy of the JK Rowling novel A Casual Vacancy.

Last January, with speculation mounting Nicola Sturgeon planned to call another referendum because of Brexit, it hired former Labour MSP Graeme Pearson as its chief executive.

At the time, he said he had "never heard" of the group, which boasts 25,000 supporters.

Paid £50,000 for a commitment of one and half days per week, he quit within seven months.

He was replaced in August by another former Labour politician, Pamela Nash, who was the MP for Airdrie & Shotts from 2010 to 2015.

In December, a group of former Scotland in Union staff set up a rival pro-Union campaign called UK Unity with a more aggressive "populist" tone and a vehement pro-Brexit stance.

UK Unity is led by David Clews, who was elected as a Tory councillor in Renfrewshire in 2007, defected to Labour in 2011, and left elected politics in 2012.

A spokesperson for Scotland in Union said: "All information on our supporters is protected and held securely in accordance with best practice and we regret internal documents have been shared with external parties.

"We have reported the matter to both the police and the Information Commissioner.

"We have taken all necessary steps to make our affected supporters aware and will continue to investigate how these documents have been misused."It's impossible to know what it will be, but there will be something. It could be a massive storm, a devastating flood or a lethal heatwave.

There will be disturbing images too: drowning children, collapsing ice cliffs or staggering and starving polar bears perhaps. And, of course, there will be the deniers saying it's all a myth.

In one way or another climate change will feature big in 2018. Each time an unusually destructive weather event hits, the arguments will run. Is carbon dioxide pollution from burning fossil fuels to blame, and what should we do about it?

Investments in coal, oil and gas technologies will be questioned, our dependence on cars challenged and our high-energy, high-waste consumer lifestyles put under scrutiny. Is the way we live actually sustainable?

The President of the United States, assuming he's still in office, will take one view - the wrong one - and most of the rest of the world will take another view, the right one. In Scotland ministers will say that their targets to cut climate pollution are world-leading, and environmentalists will push them to go further.

The battle lines have already been drawn. The Scottish Government is currently committed to reducing carbon emissions 90 per cent by 2050, but campaigners want the target to be zero, and by 2040.

They argue this is essential if Scotland wants to live up to the 2015 international Paris Agreement to tackle climate change. "Doing our fair share under the Paris deal would mean we reduce emissions to zero by 2040, along with a 77 per cent cut by 2030," said Dr Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland.

The First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has yet to commit herself. She has promised that her government would be "coming to an early decision on when we will aim to reach net zero emissions". The debates in 2018 will be over what the date should be.

Another key environmental argument will be over fish farming. Two Holyrood committees are planning an in-depth investigation into the industry, which wants to double its business from £1.8 billion in 2016 to £3.6 billion by 2030.

But fish farms around the coast have been plagued with problems, including sea lice, disease and mishaps, often leading to mass mortalities. The industry has admitted to having to throw away up to ten million salmon in 2016, a quarter of its stock.

A series of revelations in the Sunday Herald have also uncovered the so-called 'Slicegate' scandal. Documents released under freedom of information law have shown how the Scottish Environment Protection Agency dropped a plan to ban a toxic fish farm pesticide known as Slice after pressure from the industry and government.

MSPs on the environment and rural economy committee will be furiously lobbied by all sides of the argument, and will have to sift multiple facts and myths. Their job is important, but it will not be easy.

The age-old clash between development and conservation will also be re-run in many forms next year. Communities will oppose new housing estates, waste plants and wind farms, and definitions of what's really in the national interest will widely differ.

As often happens, one particularly controversial development may grab the headlines and characterise the arguments. In 2018 this could be the escalating fight over whether or not to allow a US developer to build a golf course on an endangered system of sand dunes at Coul Links on the Sutherland coast.

The development is backed by some residents, and opposed by others. It has business support, but is opposed by every major environmental organisation. It is shaping up into a major confrontation - and the outcome is very difficult to predict.

Actor Hugh Jackman believes the changing landscape in the TV industry has forced Hollywood filmmakers to do better in order to get people to watch movies in cinemas. The Greatest Showman actor said the TV industry is going through a rapid change with high quality writing and acting.

"There's been now for a while this belief and this commitment to giving people more than they expect, changing things up, taking some risk," Jackman told Collider.

"The landscape in TV has been changing so rapidly and there's such high quality - high-quality writing and acting - and that it's inevitable. If we're gonna convince people to go out to a cinema, we have to give them more than they're gonna get at home," he added.What Did Pearl Jam's Jeremy Look Like?

Minimum wage workers in 18 states will get a pay hike next week when higher wage floors go into effect around the country for 2018.

With the federal minimum wage remaining just $7.25 per hour, more and more states have opted to implement their own, higher rates that local employers must observe. Many of the bumps slated for New Year's Day come courtesy of recent ballot initiatives approved by voters or bills passed by statehouses, in red and blue states alike.

Some of those states have laws requiring that the minimum wage is adjusted each year according to an inflation index, to rise with the cost of living. So several of the raises amount to less than a quarter an hour.

But other states that recently enacted new laws will have more significant increases. Maine's will move a full dollar, to $10. Hawaii's will rise 85 cents, to $10.10. And Colorado's will increase 90 cents, to $10.20.

Here are the states with new minimum wages, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank that tracks minimum wage legislation:

Alaska: $9.84, $.04 increase

Arizona: $10.50, $.50 increase

California: $11.00, $.50 increase

Colorado: $10.20, $.90 increase

Florida: $8.25, $.15 increase

Hawaii: $10.10, $.85 increase

Maine: $10.00, $1.00 increase

Michigan: $9.25, $.35 increase

Minnesota: $9.65, $.15 increase

Missouri: $7.85, $.15 increase

Montana: $8.30, $.15 increase

New Jersey: $8.60, $.16 increase

New York: $10.40, $.70 increase

Ohio: $8.30, $.15 increase

Rhode Island: $10.10, $.50 increase

South Dakota: $8.85, $.20 increase

Vermont: $10.50, $.50 increase

Washington: $11.50, $.50 increase

The institute estimates that the raises will impact 4.5 million workers. (For a map of the increases, go here.)

The federal minimum wage hasn't budged in more than eight years and prevails in any state that doesn't mandate a higher one. The last hike, in 2009, was the result of a series of increases signed into law by President George W. Bush. President Barack Obama stumped for a minimum wage hike throughout his second term, but Republicans in Congress blocked Democratic proposals from coming up for a vote.

Minimum wage bumps tend to be popular with the general public, with support often crossing partisan lines. A HuffPost YouGov poll last year found that more than half of all Americans thought a minimum wage raise would be good for workers, while only a third thought it would be a bad idea. The backing was greatest ― and most bipartisan ― for a modest hike to $10.10, as opposed to a bolder raise to $15.

Buoyed by that support, labor unions and low-wage workers have succeeded in getting raises passed on the state and local levels as the federal rate has stayed stagnant. Voters have approved minimum wage referendums even in more conservative states like Nebraska and South Dakota. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia now require a higher minimum wage than the federal one.

Dozens of cities and counties have also raised their minimum wages beyond the state and federal levels. In some cases, the hikes have gone as high as $15 per hour ― the stated goal of the Fight for $15 campaign, the union-backed movement that began with striking fast-food workers in 2012 but soon spread to other low-wage industries.

All that success by activists has prompted a backlash from Republican state lawmakers seeking to rein in minimum wage hikes. More than two dozen states now have "preemption" laws on their books that block localities from implementing their own raises. Many of these laws were passed in just the last few years to thwart campaigns by workers and unions.

Just this year, Republicans in Missouri passed a preemption law to retroactively kill a minimum wage hike enacted by city leaders in St. Louis. Under the new law, no locality could have a wage floor higher than the one mandated by the state. As HuffPost reported in July, the new law had the effect of reversing St. Louis' minimum wage, taking it from $10 to the current state level of $7.70.Get SOULCALIBUR VI, Yakuza Kiwami, and My Time At Portia when you subscribe for just $12!

Trump is a historically unpopular President. The bills passed by the Republican Congress are hated.

In 2018, the United States will likely see a wave election, with control of the House and possibly the Senate returning to the Democrats.

I remember a similar election, one I followed closely as my job: 2006. The Democrats took the House, and did virtually nothing with it. They did not meaningfully oppose Bush.

Then in 2008, Democrats took the House, Senate, and Presidency and used it to pass an inadequate stimulus, a flawed healthcare plan (which, yes, has helped some people), and some technocratic fixes, while basically running an austerian, neoliberal policy regime: They bailed out bankers, collaborated with banks to take away houses from homeowners through fraud, increased drone murders, and so on.

They then lost control of the House and Senate, lost about a thousand seats at State level, and eventually lost the Presidency to the most unpopular Presidential winner in history (running a candidate who had the second highest negatives of any major party candidate ever).

All of this happened for a simple reason: The Democrats governed badly. Yeah, the worst part of 2008 was patched over (something which would have happened anyway–financial crises and recessions end), but basically the economy never, ever became good for most Americans again. We saw an actual decrease in life span for many Americans, we saw the rise of the opiate crisis, we saw the percentage of people with jobs never recover.

It was catastrophic, and the Democrats didn't fix it.

Yeah, they did some good. But they didn't do much and they did a lot of harm.

Fed up, enough Americans in the right places decided to try the other side.

Now the other side has revealed themselves as even more rapacious and incompetent, and Americans will then go back to Democrats.

Ping.

Pong.

Ping.

This ends ONLY when one party or the other decides to govern to the benefit of a significant majority.

Democrats did this under FDR and they basically controlled DC for 5o years or so, until they fucked it up by failing to handle the oil and inflation crises of the 70s–at which point, they decided to go along with Republicans in getting rid of the economic and political policies which made the previous period of great prosperity possible.

So, there are some signs that Democrats are beginning to get it: increased support for single payer, anger over various internet monopolies, and so on.

But when they win, they have to actually DO IT. Especially once they have a President, they must just ram through the right shit. 51 votes in the Senate is all it takes if you are serious. That's a choice.

Until they do...

The thesis is an attempt to explain why humans have yet to meet or interact with intelligent life outside the planet.

The theory, proposed by MIT radio astronomer John A. Ball, says that aliens out there are smarter than humans, but not yet powerful enough to take over the universe, so they monitor human activity from afar. Ball explains that they are curious enough to stop by once in a while, and that is why there are so many sightings of UFOs and alien crafts, reports the Science Examiner (SE).

Ball likens these intelligent aliens to zookeepers and officers at a nature preserve who watch and monitor animals, but do not interfere with their activities. In a paper published by him, he calls these aliens Extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) and argues that their presence cannot be proven, but they cannot also be disproved. He leads his line of reasoning based on what he calls the "crucial questions".

"Why are we unaware of ETI? A premise of most searches is that ETI are trying to communicate with us, but we are not quite clever enough to see or hear them. I suggest, instead, that if ETI had chosen to announce their presence to us, we would be aware. Since we are not, I presume they have not," reads an excerpt from the paper.

He also squarely dismisses the idea of searching Earth-like planets for life, saying it is akin to looking for birds in empty eggshells. Ball believes that an Earth-like planet is only a good place for ETI to originate from, not exist in. The conditions that harbour life on Earth that is often searched for in other planets like warmth, gravity, and air, could, in fact, be detrimental to ETIs, especially if they are much more advanced than humans, says Ball.

An advanced life form from some other part of the universe, says Ball, could be imagined to have a kind of relationship with humans on Earth similar to the way mankind has with primitive Earth life (PEL). Based on the time scale, he believes that ETI to the human relationship can be likened to the difference between humans and molluscs and trilobites.

"Now I can imagine talking with mammals and birds; indeed I've done it, although the conversation was on a pretty low intellectual level. But oysters? The point is that if this analogy is good for anything, then our relationship with typical ETI is probably nothing like the relationship of a primitive human tribe with technological man, which analogy seems to be in the minds of many who propose ETI searches, but instead is more like the relationship of an animal, a rather primitive animal with mankind," he explains.

The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute had recently outlined a few places in the solar system that could possibly harbour life.

Seth Shostak, senior astronomer with SETI, in an interview with Futurism said that there were "at least seven other places in our own solar system, so kind of next door places you could get to with a rocket, that could have microbial life," and added that it was likely that microbial life was found before intelligent life.

Life on Earth is believed to have been formed based on carbon and other gases and materials found here. So based on the materials that are available in a place like, Enceladus, for example, it could be possible for life to form in ways that are incomprehensible to humans. It could be possible that the life exists in forms that researchers might not be able to recognise.

There is also a prevailing theory that life came to Earth aboard fast-moving space dust.Amid intensifying shareholder pressure on companies to be more transparent about their political spending, Goldman Sachs has moved to prevent its shareholders from voting to force executives to disclose their efforts to influence politicians, according to corporate documents reviewed by International Business Times. The banking behemoth, which has been boosted by taxpayer-financed bailouts and has landed former executives in key government jobs, asked federal regulators to bless its attempt to block the initiative in a letter sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission — an agency now chaired by a former outside attorney for Goldman Sachs whose spouse also worked at the bank.

Goldman's request to the SEC comes in response to shareholders' proposed resolution to require the bank to release an annual report documenting the policies governing the company's lobbying, and disclosing all payments made by the company for direct and indirect lobbying of public officials.

Between 2010 and 2016, Goldman has spent more than $26 million on federal lobbying, on top of what it spent at the state level where "disclosure is uneven or absent," wrote the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA), which represents more than 1,000 religious organizations and has spearheaded the resolution. The group also said the bank does not comprehensively disclose its memberships in and payments to powerful lobbying groups -- even as at least one of those groups has lobbied the National Economic Council headed by former Goldman president Gary Cohn.

"We are concerned that Goldman's lack of lobbying disclosure presents significant reputational risks," wrote UUA in its November 2017 statement justifying the resolution. "Absent a system of accountability, company assets could be used for objectives contrary to Goldman's long-term interests."

On December 28, Goldman Managing Director Beverly O'Toole sent a letter to the SEC telling regulators that it planned to bar the resolution from appearing on its annual proxy statement -- a move that would prevent other Goldman shareholders from voting on the initiative. In asking the SEC to approve such a move, the bank argued that the company already discloses much of its lobbying. It also asserted that the initiative relates to lobbying expenditures that total less than 0.2 percent of the company's annual revenues -- or less than $15 million.

"The company's lobbying expenditures are not significant," O'Toole asserted. "While the company engages in certain lobbying activities, primarily policy advocacy at the U.S. federal level, that it feels may be in the best interests of the Company its clients and shareholders, the company is not a lobbying firm, and its ultimate responsibilities to its clients and its shareholders are to continue to innovate and operate regardless of the result of any particular lobbying effort."

Citing an SEC rule governing what can and cannot be excluded from shareholder proxy statements, O'Toole concluded that "the small amount of expenditures, broadly defined, related to such (lobbying) activities underscores the lack of significance to the company when considered as compare to the standard" in the rule.

Goldman currently has policies in place that limit campaign contributions to an employee-funded Political Action Committee (PAC), according to a 2017 report on corporate political disclosures from the Center for Political Accountability and the Wharton School of Business. The report's authors also note that Goldman prohibited trade associations and 501(c)(4) nonprofits from using the company's payments on election spending. These rules, however, cover contributions to candidates and committees, not money spent on lobbying.

The resolution comes at a time when publicly traded Fortune 500 companies are under intensifying pressure to better disclose all of their political spending. More than 50 Fortune 250 companies have voted on shareholder resolutions regarding the disclosure of lobbying or political spending in 2017, although none have passed, according to Proxy Monitor, a group that tracks shareholder resolution votes. The SEC has also faced pressure to use its authority to require executives to tell shareholders about company spending on politics -- but the agency has argued that Congress has prevented it from acting.

The agency is currently lead by Jay Clayton, a Trump appointee who was previously a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, which the New York Times said was Goldman Sachs' "go-to law firm for more than a century."

Earlier this year Republicans on Capitol Hill moved to make it more difficult for shareholders to file resolutions.

A provision in the House's wide-ranging Financial CHOICE Act, would change the eligibility requirements who could bring a shareholder resolutions to a vote. Under current law, a shareholder needs to control 1 percent of the company or own $2,000 worth of publicly traded stock to submit a resolution. But under the CHOICE Act, the $2,000 threshold would be eliminated, leaving just the 1 percent requirement. Under those proposed rules, Goldman Sachs shareholders would need to own nearly a billion dollars of the company to be eligible to bring a shareholder resolution. The legislation, which also would undue many of the regulations put in place by the 2010 Dodd-Frank legislative package, passed the House in June, but has not been voted on by the Senate.Would Ronald Reagan approve of the tax bill that President Donald Trump signed this month work? In a podcast interview, Bruce Bartlett, a former economic adviser to the 40th president, tells International Business Times what the Republicans' strategy seems to have been, what the bill's repercussions might be, and what Reagan really thought about tax cuts.

Subscribers can listen to the entire podcast by clicking here.

Bartlett traced the history of Republicans' views on taxes and budget issues, and argued that the tax legislation is designed not only to deliver big tax cuts to the wealthy, but also to create large budget deficits. Bartlett says that conservative champions of the bill want to create those deficits as a way to manufacture the budget conditions that will justify cutting larger social programs.

What follows is an excerpt of the podcast discussion.

How historic is this tax bill? Is it a watershed moment for the Republican Party?

Oh, I think this is the culmination of everything the right has been trying to do, literally, for decades. I would compare it to, in terms of the right, to the Great Society, in terms of liberalism. It is they have been talking about these things for a long time, and finally had the votes and presidential leadership that they needed to accomplish what they wanted to accomplish. And of course, one could characterize the right's agenda, since that day, as trying to undo all of that.

The right, a long time ago, figured out that they couldn't assault the welfare state head on. It was too strong. So they've assaulted it through a back door, which is to systematically and consistently drain the government of revenues, and force, even Democratic presidents, such as Obama and Clinton, to do a lot of their dirty work for them by cutting spending, and holding back on new initiatives that are, in many cases, badly needed, and they're simply continuing. The problem is, I think they've gone past the point of sanity. They're simply doing things now that don't even make sense.

House Speaker Paul Ryan has suggested that reducing Medicare spending could be up next on Congress's agenda. Do you see the tax bill as a deliberate step to create more debt, which can then be used as a justification to cut major social programs?

Absolutely. No question about it. You can date the beginning of this strategy to a particular date in history, which was June 6th, 1978, which is the day [California's] Proposition 13 passed. And you have to remember that up until that time, it had been a consistent Republican position that you shouldn't cut taxes, unless you also cut spending because they were opposed to the deficit, they believed in the balance budget.

Many Republican presidents were willing to raise taxes if necessary to reduce the deficit. And Proposition 13 changed their philosophy because they could see that there was very large support from the general public for just slashing taxes and not giving a damn about spending. In fact, the authors of Proposition 13, [Howard] Jarvis and [Paul] Gann, said, "Cutting spending's not our problem. We just want taxes cut. If you care about spending, if you care about government, you fix it."

Immediately after that, Republicans glommed on to the idea that we should just cut taxes anytime, anywhere, anyway. And of course, Milton Friedman and other Republican economists agreed with them on that philosophy, but there was still a problem that some reputable Republican economists, such as Herb Stein and Alan Greenspan, had reservations about cutting taxes, increasing the deficit intentionally, at a time when inflation was high. This was one of the main reasons why they thought spending needed to be cut when you cut taxes because the deficit was inflationary.

They rationalized their party's movement towards rampant tax cutting by inventing this idea that I call starve the beast... When the deficit gets really, really big, then even Democrats have to join in cutting spending to reduce the deficit because of course, Republicans will never support a tax increase.

The last [Republican] president to who supported a tax increase was George H.W. Bush, and his own party destroyed him and intentionally sought to have him defeated in 1992 for that sin. I think this was a very intentional and deliberate strategy on the part of Grover Norquist and Newt Gingrich, in order to purge the last of the responsible Republicans from the party and get total control by what are essentially nihilists.

You were an adviser to President Reagan, who is remembered as an ardent tax cutter. Did you shift your political ideology and if so, how did htat happen?

Well, yes, I pivoted, but I've never pivoted away from my belief that the 1981 tax cut, which I had a personal hand in drafting, was useful and necessary legislation for the time. I think too many people are not now old enough to remember how horrible the inflation problem of the 1970's was. And they've grown up and have lived in so many years of essentially zero inflation, they've forgotten how much that frightened people.

One of the consequences of inflation is that when workers got a cost of living pay raises, they got pushed up into higher tax brackets. So, you had a continuing tax increase going on automatically because of inflation. Because there was no indexing of the tax system. So there was need for a big tax cut just to keep the tax burden from rising.

Furthermore, I would point out that Ronald Reagan himself, reversed course on the tax cut almost immediately in 1982, he supported the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act, which was the largest peacetime tax increase in American history. He supported a very large tax increase for social security in 1983, and lesser tax increases almost every other year of his presidency. By the end of his presidency, he had raised taxes by about half the amount that he cut taxes, you see.

So he took back about 50 percent of the 1981 tax cut, and it was half the size, in terms of its impact on the deficit and revenues, as it was when it was first enacted. I think this was an act of responsibility and courage, and leadership. Most Republicans today, either don't know about it, or just pretend it never happened.

Why do you think that part of Reagan's record is so often forgotten?

I think after a certain number of years, the legend takes the place of reality. And I think very few Republicans care about history, they have no interest in research or analysis, or facts, or data. They live in a fantasy world and in their fantasy world, they have to have some heroes. And so they made Reagan into a hero, and that means that they have to suppress anything about him that runs against their heroic narrative.

I think this is just common in history. It's been done with kings and leaders of the past. I think the further away we get away from the true Reagan, whose remembered by living people, and he becomes just a heroic character. I think of the right term I want to use. It's a myth. That is the myth of Reagan. It's more powerful than the reality of Reagan.

Polls show that right now, this tax cut is very unpopular. Do you believe this could be a turning point in the tax wars — one in which the opponents of this kind of tax cutting are able to use this tax bill to fundamentally change the tax debate in America?

I'm not prepared to say that that's the case. Here's my concern. Once the tax cut is enacted, the Republicans will hold the high ground. It will be very difficult to dislodge them from that position, even if they lose control of Congress. As you know, because of gerrymandering, and the enormous money advantage that Republicans have, it will be extraordinarily difficult for Democrats to even get control of the House next year, and the Senate looks out of reach.

And even if they got control of both, Trump would veto anything, or Pence if that is the case, will veto any effort to raise taxes, and even after 2020, when maybe they'll be a Democratic president, it's highly unlikely that he will have enough, or she, enough votes to really do much except around the edges.

My point is, that they have put fiscal policy to a very large extent, on automatic pilot for many, many years to come, and I think Republicans think long term, in the sense that we're willing to take one step backwards in order to be able to take two steps forward. I think anything Democrats do to fix the fiscal mess, to cut spending, or raise taxes, will be very, very unpopular and help put Republicans back in power. And anything Democrats do to restore a fiscal responsibility, to reduce the deficit, is like putting money into a savings account that Republicans will then use to cut taxes again when they get back in power.

Really, the Clinton years is the perfect example of this. Clinton, to his great credit, had the courage to raise taxes, this led to budget surpluses, which Bush and his party then completely disappointed into ... Completely, economically worthless tax cuts that helped starve the beast and make Obama's life very difficult once he took office.

They know this history. They know that Clinton's 1993 tax increase, led almost directly to the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994. They're thinking, "Fine. Let's have a Democratic Congress and Democratic President in 2021 who will pass big tax increases, and spending cuts, and get the budget under control. We will take control again in 2022 and 2024, and we'll start all over again." Cutting taxes, and doing everything that they're doing right now.

In your opinion, what are the most problematic parts of this tax bill?

There are so many things it's hard to know where to begin. I think getting rid of the personal exemption is pretty terrible, myself. The idea of the personal exemption was that everybody deserved some amount of income, free of tax, that they could live on, as a matter of principle. And Republicans are destroying that principle.

They are basically saying, "All of your income belongs to us, except what we give back to you out of the goodness of our heart. You don't, in principle, have the right to any income that we can't take from you when it suits our purpose." That sounds like a Republican argument, because it's one's Republicans have used, and now they've turned it on its head and are using it to pay for this enormous tax cut for the rich.

I think a lot of people don't understand how much of a tax cut there is in this legislation, because they hear the number $1 trillion, or $1.5 trillion. That's the net number. The gross number is something along the lines of $6 trillion, almost all that going to the wealthy, and to big corporations. Then there is about $4.5 trillion of tax increases of which we just discussed the two biggest ones.

You have described a situation in which Republicans cut taxes, create deficits and Democrats are constantly playing defense. Can the Democrats break that cycle?

Well it will take a long, long time. I mean, Republicans have been working for at least 40 years to get to where they are now. And one of the ways they did this, is by creating a vast number of institutions and outlets for people who think the way they do to create and echo chamber, and really I call itself brainwashing ... Brainwashing among a great many people who vote for them. There's nothing like this on the left. They don't put the resources into long term institutions and programs. They tend to be fireman. We're gonna rush to put out this fire, and once that fire's put out, they sit back and relax.

Meanwhile, the Republicans are setting other fires in lots of other places. I think it's gonna take a long-term mentality, long-term strategy, long-term resources, and if you're lucky you may be able to get something like a replay of the progressive era, where you may have a few decades of time to be able to implement some policies that will undo the harm that is being done, and perhaps do some good. I don't see any beginning of that because the absolute beginning would have to be leadership. And I don't see a leader anywhere on the left, let alone in the Democratic Party, who I think is popular enough to be able to change direction.

I mean, my idea would be somebody like Bobby Kennedy. I don't think people like Bernie Sanders really have the wherewithal to do what needs to be done. It has to be somebody a lot younger, more dynamic, and there have to be resources. There have to be people like the Mercers, and the Kochs, and the Adelsons on the left, who are willing to put serious money, not just into campaigns, but into organizations and institutions that will try to fight the fight on a daily basis.Former state Rep. Brandon Hixon of Caldwell

Former state legislator Brandon Hixon was arrested for the second time this month for driving under the influence.

Hixon, 36, a Caldwell Republican, was arrested Saturday evening by Caldwell Police and placed in the Canyon County jail. He was later released, Canyon officials said.

No more details were available late Saturday.

Hixon was arrested December 9 in Meridian and charged with misdemeanor DUI and resisting arrest. He is scheduled to make his initial court appearance at 3 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 2, at the Ada County Courthouse.

One of the company's most interesting initiatives, Project Aristotle, gathered several of Google's best and brightest to help the organization codify the secrets to team effectiveness.

Specifically, Google wanted to know why some teams excelled while others fell behind.

Before this study, like many other organizations, Google execs believed that building the best teams meant compiling the best people. It makes sense. The best engineer plus an MBA, throw in a PhD, and there you have it. The perfect team, right? In the words of Julia Rozovsky, Google's people analytics manager, "We were dead wrong."

Selected to lead the efforts was Abeer Dubey, Google's director of people analytics (HR). Eager to find the perfect mixture of skills, backgrounds, and traits to engineer super-teams, Dubey recruited statisticians, organizational psychologists, sociologists, engineers, and researchers to help solve the riddle. Included in this all-star lineup was Rozovsky.

Fast forward two years, and Project Aristotle has managed to study 180 Google teams, conduct 200-plus interviews, and analyze over 250 different team attributes. Unfortunately, though, there was still no clear pattern of characteristics that could be plugged into a dream-team generating algorithm.

As described in an article in The New York Times, it wasn't until Google started considering some intangibles that things began to fall into place.

"As they struggled to figure out what made a team successful, Rozovsky and her colleagues kept coming across research by psychologists and sociologists that focused on what are known as "group norms" - the traditions, behavioral standards, and unwritten rules that govern how teams function when they gather... Norms can be unspoken or openly acknowledged, but their influence is often profound."

With a new lens and some added direction from a research study on collective intelligence (abilities that emerge out of collaboration) by a group of psychologists from Carnegie Mellon, MIT, and Union College, Project Aristotle's researchers went back to the drawing board to comb their data for unspoken customs. Specifically, any team behaviors that magnified the collective intelligence of the group.

Through Google's Re:Work website, a resource that shares Google's research, ideas, and practices on people operations, Rozovsky outlined the five key characteristics of enhanced teams.

1. Dependability.

Team members get things done on time and meet expectations.

2. Structure and clarity.

High-performing teams have clear goals, and have well-defined roles within the group.

3. Meaning.

The work has personal significance to each member.

4. Impact.

The group believes their work is purposeful and positively impacts the greater good.

Yes, that's four, not five. The last one stood out from the rest:

5. Psychological Safety.

We've all been in meetings and, due to the fear of seeming incompetent, have held back questions or ideas. I get it. It's unnerving to feel like you're in an environment where everything you do or say is under a microscope.

But imagine a different setting. A situation in which everyone is safe to take risks, voice their opinions, and ask judgment-free questions. A culture where managers provide air cover and create safe zones so employees can let down their guard. That's psychological safety.

I know, not the quantitative data that you were hoping for. However, Google found that teams with psychologically safe environments had employees who were less likely to leave, more likely to harness the power of diversity, and ultimately, who were more successful.In most countries organising an illegal demonstration on Facebook might get you a fine or, if you're unlucky, a short jail sentence.

But there is one place where it can actually help get you the death penalty.

In Saudi Arabia today there are 14 pro-democracy demonstrators who face execution after being caught up in protests against the royal family which turned violent.

One of them, Mujtaba al Sweikat, was on his way to take up a place at the University of Western Michigan when he was arrested at one of the country's airports.

On his charge sheet the teenager, who was just 17 at the time, was accused of "supervising" a group on Facebook and "photographing the demonstrations, which is punishable according to the cybercrime bill".

So he wasn't exactly arrested at the scene, Molotov cocktail in hand.

Another death row juvenile, Ali al Nimr, was convicted of: "Setting up a page on his Blackberry with over 800 people, naming it 'The Liberals', with the goal of inciting demonstrations by way of sending pictures of the demonstrations , their time/locations and inviting people to participate."

Hardly storming the barricades but, again, enough to appear on his charge sheet.

It's a bit like the famous Not the Nine O'Clock News comedy sketch from the time of the Brixton riots when the racist police officer is berated by his sergeant for his over exuberance in arresting black people.

Offences include "wearing a loud shirt in a built-up area", "walking on the cracks in the pavement" and "loitering with intent to use a pedestrian crossing".

Funny if, as in this case, it wasn't so serious.

For not only were these men's, sorry children's, confessions of violence made after prolonged torture but they were also denied access to lawyers and a fair trial.

What's even more disturbing is the fact that British police may have directly helped arrest them.

The human rights group, Reprieve, has warned that training from British officers was equipping Saudi police with skills that could be used to "identify individuals who later go on to be tortured or subjected to other human rights abuses".

Britain's secretive training of foreign regimes with dubious human rights records was heavily criticised in a parliamentary report last year.

The Home Affairs Select Committee found that the College of Policing had generated more than £8.5m in revenue through international work which included training in forensics, child abuse investigations and counter-terrorism.

The trouble is, as we all know, that one man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist.

So those swept along by the Arab Spring who took to the streets of Saudi Arabia in 2011 may seem like romantic musketeers to some of us, but to the authorities there they are terrorists, pure and simple.

MPs were told that hundreds of Saudi Arabian police officers had been trained by the UK, but specific areas were not gone into so as not to identify Saudi "areas of weakness".

However, according to the BBC, there were plans to widen the training from forensics to cybersecurity, mobile phone analysis and CCTV systems.

Does this mean that people like young Mujtaba and 20-year-old Munir al-Adam who was born disabled with an eye and hearing defect, are being spied on through social media with the help of British police?

Munir's charge sheet included the accusation that he had saved messages from rioters onto his mobile phone.

In essence, the Saudi authorities claim the protests turned violent and the men are being executed for "attacks on police".

But the families and campaigners claim confessions were extracted under torture and so are not safe.

As Munir's mother, Um, 50, put it: "Even if we suppose that, hypothetically, Munir is guilty as charged, is it fair and just that he receive a death sentence? Has he shed blood or killed someone?"

Saudi Arabia wasn't the only place to have riots in 2011. We did as well, following a police shooting in Tottenham, North London.

But even the man who went on Facebook urging rioters to "put Manchester on the map" only got three years, much the same as those who actually did the looting.

The families of both Munir and Mujtaba don't deny that they were at the protests. But they do deny that they acted violently.

The United Nations and Human Rights Watch have said the demonstrations at the time were generally peaceful but often erupted into violence when Saudi forces used excessive force against the demonstrators.

Now a group of MPs, including former Labour leader Ed Miliband, have written to Theresa May calling on her to "personally urge" Saudi Arabia's King Salman to halt the executions.

Their letter went on: "We also ask that you take urgent steps to confirm that UK assistance played no role in these individuals' conviction under Saudi Arabia's anti-cybercrime law".

Maya Foa, director of Reprieve, was a bit more blunt when she condemned the Prime Minister's "deafening silence" on the issue.

"When 14 young men face imminent beheading for protest-related offences, simply raising the cases in private doesn't cut it," she said.

Let's hope the PM does something to make a difference before any royal assent to the executions is given. It's currently down to crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, because his father, King Salman, is on holiday.

The things they delegate when they go on a break.

Anthony Harwood is former foreign editor of the Daily MailTheresa May has U-turned on a promise not to carry out immigration checks on Grenfell fire victims, leaving survivors who need help at risk of deportation if they come forward.

The Prime Minister pledged in Parliament not to use the tragedy as an excuse to check residents' immigration status, but ministers confirmed anyone wanting help must register with Home Office officials and be subject to normal immigration rules after 12 months.

Downing Street confirmed to The Independent that what happens to survivors at that point would "depend on their circumstances".

Campaigners had raised concerns victims may not come forward for help because they feared questions being raised about their immigration status, with Labour branding the Government's newly unveiled approach as "grotesque".

It came as police announced 87 discoveries of human remains in the charred tower, but could not say they belonged to the same number of people because of the "catastrophic damage" in the building.

Ministers also announced they would send a task force to take over parts of the beleaguered Kensington and Chelsea Council following heavy criticism of its response to the disaster.

Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis said: "The Government has been clear that our priority is to ensure that victims of this tragedy get the access they need to vital services, irrespective of immigration status.

"This period of leave to remain for those directly affected by the fire will provide survivors with the time to deal with the extremely difficult circumstances in which they find themselves and start to rebuild their lives whilst considering their future options, as well as to assist the police and other authorities with their enquiries about the fire."

Jolyon Maugham QC, a prominent barrister who has volunteered to offer free legal services to Grenfell victims, said: "You can't really call this an amnesty. The Government is offering not to deport you immediately if you give it the wherewithal to deport you later. It's hard to see that it will have the response the Government says it desires."

Karen Doyle, spokesperson for Movement for Justice – an immigration rights group – said: "A 12-month amnesty is like handing over a ticking time bomb to severely traumatised people. Recovery from what happened at Grenfell will be a lifetime process – one that requires people are in a safe and secure environment to make space for that painstaking work.

"Navigating the immigration system, living with constant fear of deportation and being constantly told you are a liar is itself a traumatising process.

"For those who are undocumented, who know what fate awaits them at the end of 12 months, this 'offer' means nothing.

"The only meaningful offer would be a complete amnesty with permanent right to remain. Let these people heal."

Those granted limited leave to remain will have full access to relevant support and assistance, but only for the limited time available.

Diane Abbott, the Shadow Home Secretary, said the possibility of deportation for survivors was "grotesque".

Ms Abbot said: "The partial amnesty is limited to 12 months, which does not go far enough.

"Some victims have literally lost everything in this horrific tragedy: all their possessions, homes and loved ones. The idea that on top of this they could be deported later is grotesque.

"To access all the support they need without fear of deportation, any survivors concerned about their status must be given indefinite leave to remain. Otherwise, they may just disappear off the grid."

Two weeks ago, Theresa May told the House of Commons: "We will not use this tragic incident as a reason to carry out immigration checks on those involved or on those providing vital information to identify victims or those assisting with the criminal investigation.

"We will make sure that all victims, irrespective of their immigration status, will be able to access the services they need, including healthcare and accommodation."

Earlier on Wednesday, the Metropolitan Police said that, even with the team of 250 forensic pathologists and officers that are currently working within the tower, it would still take "many months" for the final death toll to be known.

Commander Stuart Cundy said: "Until formal identification has been completed to the coroner's satisfaction I cannot say how many people have now been recovered."

The last visible human remains were extracted on Monday, and 21 people have been formally identified by the coroner and their families informed.

He added: "This will take us many months, but we will search each and every flat.

"We will use all the information we have, especially what we have been told by survivors and families, to prioritise our search where we believe we may find more human remains.

"We are absolutely determined to do all we can as quickly as we can to return all those who are in Grenfell Tower to their loved ones."

It was also revealed that a government task force will step in to take over the running of certain council services, in the wake of Kensington and Chelsea Council's heavily criticised response to the tragedy.

Communities Secretary Sajid Javid confirmed outside experts will be brought in to manage Kensington and Chelsea Council's housing, regeneration, community engagement and governance services.

It comes just days after leading MPs and campaigners warned The Independent that the Government had to strip the local council of its powers or face possible civil unrest.

They said the Government should impose new commissioners to run the local authority, which was plunged into further turmoil last week after leader Nick Paget-Brown and deputy leader Rock Feilding-Mellen were forced to stand down over their handling of the disaster, which claimed at least 80 lives.

Robert Black, the head of Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, also stood down to "assist with the investigation and inquiry".

Mr Javid said: "The scale of the recovery effort needed on the Lancaster West Estate in the months to come cannot be underestimated. Support to survivors, the families and friends of those who lost their lives and residents in the wider community must and will be ongoing. The challenge of providing that support is and will continue to be significant. I want to help the council meet that challenge.

"The immediate response to the disaster is being coordinated by the Grenfell response team, headed up by John Barradell. He is ably supported by a number of colleagues drawn from London councils, the wider local government sector including the RBKC [Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea], the voluntary sector, police, health and fire services as well as central government. Their expertise and hard work is making a huge difference.

"As well as providing that immediate support, we must have an eye to the future. This intervention is putting in place the foundations that will support the longer term recovery."

At the despatch box in the House of Commons today, new housing minister Alok Sharma fought back tears as he described the suffering of the families of victims he had met since the tragedy occurred.

"'The families which I've met have been through unimaginable pain," he said, before pausing for several seconds. "This is a tragedy which should never have happened, and we are determined to do all that we can to make sure something like this never happens again." When he sat down, he wiped his face with a tissue.

The two comedians Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexei Stolyarov, known as Vovan and Lexus, posted a 22 minute audio clip of their conversation with the ambassador where they get her to comment on the situation in Binomo – a fictional country in the South China Sea.

Posing as the Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, they spoke to Ms Haley in the days after Poland was one of 35 countries to abstain on a UN vote to reject Donald Trump's declaration of Jerusalem as Israel's capital as "null and void".

The UN General Assembly voted 128-9, excluding the abstentions, in favour of the motion.

She said: "Let me start with very much thanking you for the support we received on the vote today. We will never forget it".

Previous Mr Trump suggested he would cut off financial aid to those who voted for the motion.

The pranksters then moved the discussion to the situation in Binomo.

Mr Stolyarov, who was posing as Mr Morawiecki, said: "You know Binomo" to which Ms Haley replied "yes, yes".

"They had elections and we suppose Russia had its intervention", he continued.

Ms Haley then replied: "Yes, of course they did, absolutely.

"We've been watching that very closely, and I think we will continue to watch that as we deal with the issues that keep coming up about the South China Sea."

He then asked her what the US was planning to do about the island to which Ms Haley responded that she needed to "find out exactly what our stance is on that" and get back to them.

The comedians also questioned her about Ukraine, with whom Russia has been engaging in a proxy war since 2014, and expressed support for the former President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, who was arrested in Kiev earlier this month.

Mr Saakashvili has been accused of taking money from a Russia-based oligarch to destabilise the political situation in Ukraine but has dismissed the allegations as "lies".

Poland and Ukraine have traditionally been allies but relations have soured in recent months due in part to a spat over the wartime killing of Poles in Ukraine.

A spokesperson for Ms Haley, John Degory, told The Post and Courier he would not confirm or deny the authenticity of the video. "We have nothing to share on that at this time," he said.

The Russian pranksters are known for impersonating Eastern European officials to mock and undermine Western leaders.

Earlier this year, US Energy Secretary Rick Perry was tricked into thinking he was talking to Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman where he reportedly discussed a new fuel made from manure and alcohol.

A spokeswoman for the department told Bloomberg at the time: "These individuals are known for pranking high-level officials and celebrities, particularly those who are supportive of an agenda that is not in line with their governments. In this case, the energy security of Ukraine."A senior government adviser is facing calls for his sacking after comparing hard Brexit to appeasing the Nazis in the 1930s.

Lord Andrew Adonis, the Labour peer and ex-minister who now chairs the Government's National Infrastructure Commission, said Britain is in "serious danger" of getting Brexit wrong and his party should push to stay in the EU single market.

"My language is usually pretty subdued in politics," he told The House magazine. "But for anyone with a historical sense – and I'm a historian – recognises that leaving the economic institutions of the European Union, which have guided our destiny as a trading nation for half a century, is a very big step and the importance can't be overemphasised.

"To my mind, it's as big a step that we're taking as a country as decolonisation in the 1950s and 60s and appeasement in the 1930s. We got it right on decolonisation; we got it wrong on appeasement and I think we're in serious danger of getting it wrong in the way that we leave the EU."

He added: "If we can't have our cake and eat it then we face a serious relative decline in our living standards compared with France and Germany and I don't believe the British people will put up with that. So we would, in that event, I believe face a crisis. It may be a crisis played out over quite a number of years – which, after all, is what happened with appeasement – but there will be a crisis."

Standing by his remarks in a separate interview with the BBC, he said if the country was to do a hard Brexit, "then I do believe this will be the worst mistake this country has made since the 1930s."

Conservative MPs responded by calling for the former Labour transport secretary's dismissal. Former Tory leader Ian Duncan Smith said he was "astonished and appalled", and found the comments "deeply offensive."

Peter Bone, the Conservative MP for Wellingborough told The Sun Lord Adonis should be "fired" and Andrew Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire said he should be removed "from any advisory role to government."

His view appears to be in line with the majority of those in the UK. Research by King's College London, Rand Europe and Cambridge University found that people were more concerned with trade deals with EU and foreign countries than they were on limiting free movement of labour.

Opinion on the single market is divided in the Commons. Labour MP Stephen Kinnock told The Daily Telegraph that at least 15 Conservative MPs are in talks with to prevent a hard Brexit, meaning the Prime Minister's working parliamentary majority of 12 could be defeated.

Lord Adonis said it was "only a matter of time" before Jeremy Corbyn backs the single market.

However, the Labour leader recently sacked three shadow ministers who wanted to amend the Queen's Speech to reflect support for keeping Britain in it.

But in a briefing to journalists, the Prime Minister's spokeswoman refused calls from her colleagues to sack Lord Adonis despite "completely disagreeing" with his comments on Brexit. The spokeswoman added: "Andrew Adonis is not a member of the Government, it's for him to explain his remarks but the PM as you can imagine disagrees with them.

"He's not a Conservative peer, his job is to provide independent advice to the Government on infrastructure. It doesn't have anything to do with the views he expressed on Brexit today. She completely disagrees with those views."

Asked why the PM sacked Lord Heseltine, the former Deputy Prime Minister, for his outspoken intervention on Brexit, the spokeswoman added: "It's not comparable. Lord Heseltine is a Conservative peer. Lord Adonis is not a Conservative peer, he is not a member of the Government. He provides advice to the Government on infrastructure.

In March, Lord Heseltine was sacked from five roles as a Government adviser after rebelling on a parliamentary vote in the Lords on Brexit. At the time, he said "sometimes in politics there are issues which transcend party politics".Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said citizens are "absolutely free to criticise the government" amid the fourth day of nationwide protests.

Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated across the country since Thursday against the Islamic Republic's unelected clerical elite, a weak economy and Iranian foreign policy in the region. They have also chanted slogans in support of political prisoners.

"The government will show no tolerance for those who damage public properties, violate public order and create unrest in the society," Mr Rouhani said.

"People are absolutely free to criticise the government and protest but their protests should be in such a way as to improve the situation in the country and their life."

"Criticism is different from violence and and damaging public properties," he added.

The Iranian president also acknowledged the public's worries extended beyond the economy to corruption allegations and government transparency.

Iranian authorities temporarily blocked mobile phone access to Instagram and the messaging app Telegram to "maintain peace" amid anti-government protests, state TV reported.

The reported move to stifle internet access drew a rebuke from Donald Trump, who has regularly criticised Iran's leadership. He described the clampdown as "not good'.

At least two people were killed on Saturday in the country's biggest protests since 2009. Many of the demonstrations have been started and promoted using Telegram.

Iran's interior minister, Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazil, said authorities would respond to the "spreading of violence, fear and terror".

As the Iranian government stepped up efforts to clamp down on the demonstrations, Mr Trump tweeted: "Big protests in Iran. The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. Looks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations!"

Pavel Durov, Telegram's chief executive, confirmed access to the app had been restricted.

He wrote on Twitter: "Iranian authorities are blocking access to Telegram for the majority of Iranians after our public refusal to shut down [one of the main channels] and other peacefully protesting channels."

The company did agree to close one channel on Saturday after Iranian authorities claimed people were using it to incite violence.

Iranian state news website Irib News quoted an unnamed source as saying: "With a decision by the Supreme National Security Council, activities of Telegram and Instagram are temporarily limited."

Facebook, which owns Instagram, is yet to respond to the shutdown.

Protests began on Thursday and had included tens of thousands of people, although appeared to have died down on Sunday.

The initial clashes were over economic difficulties, rising food prices and alleged corruption among the elite, but there were also demands for the country's unelected supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to resign.

Videos posted on social media showed demonstrators chanting: "Mullahs, have some shame, leave the country alone."

As protests continued, at least two people were killed in clashes in the city of Doroud, 200 miles south-west of the capital Tehran.

The province's security chief, Habibollah Khojastepour, denied they had been shot by police.

"No bullets were shot from police and security forces at the people," he said.

"We have found evidence of enemies of the revolution, [militant] groups and foreign agents in this clash.

"The gathering was to be ended peacefully, but due to [their] presence, unfortunately this happened."

The UK's Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, said he was "watching events in Iran with concern".

He wrote on Twitter: "Vital that citizens should have the right to demonstrate peacefully."

In an attempt to appease public concerns, the Iranian government scrapped plans to raise fuel prices, agreed to increase cash payments to the poor and pledged to create at least 830,000 new jobs in the next year.As you gear up to down a g&t or two during tonight's New Year's Eve celebrations, bear in mind what your tipple of choice may say about your personality.

Gin drinkers are more likely to be psychopaths and sadists, according to study

A new study from Innsbruck University in Austria has revealed that people who enjoy bitter flavours like gin are more likely to exhibit antisocial personality traits including sadism, narcissism, psychoticism and Machiavellianism.

In the Austrian study, 953 people were asked to rank various types of food and drink with flavours ranging from bitter to sour, salty and sweet, on a six-point scale.

They were also asked questions related to personality which were designed to measure their levels of emotional stability and tendency towards everyday sadism.

The perfect gin & tonic

The two sets of results were compared and it showed that people who prefer bitter tasting food and drink like black coffee or gin also exhibited more antisocial tendencies.

Dr Christian Sagioglou and Dr Tobias Greitemeyer, who conducted the study, wrote, "The results of both studies confirmed the hypothesis that bitter taste preferences are positively associated with malevolent personality traits, with the most robust relation to everyday sadism and psychopathy.

"Regression analyses confirmed that this association holds when controlling for sweet, sour and salty taste preferences and that bitter taste preferences are the overall strongest predictor compared to the other taste preferences.

"The data thereby provide novel insights into the relationship between personality and the ubiquitous behaviours of eating drinking by consistently demonstrating a robust relation between increased enjoyment of bitter foods and heightened sadistic proclivities."

Given gin is the fastest-growing spirit drink in Ireland the results are a little worrying for Irish society.

How to make the perfect Gin and Tonic this Christmas

Online EditorsIt was only last week that the MSM tried to convince people that President Trump looking to walk away from the Iran deal was uniting the Iranian people against the United States and behind the regime. Today, CNN is trying to convince the American public that the reason the people are upset is because of the sinking economy as a result of some sanctions not being lifted and more being added.

That's not true. The fact is the Iranian regime used the money they've gotten from the Iran deal to build up Hezbollah, one of Obama's favored terrorist groups. He appears to have let them build their drug and trafficking business here in the United States.

CNN is like a counter intelligence operation working in opposition to the United State's interests.

CNN quoted an Iranian State front group – National Iranian American Council (NIAC) – to support their hypothesis:

While restrictions on financial, energy and transportation sectors were removed, hundreds of Iranian entities were not taken off the blacklists. And the United States has moved to create new sanctions over other violations, including a rocket launch this past summer.

Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, and other experts say endemic economic mismanagement and corruption have left Iranians disenchanted.

Government policies have brought about higher unemployment and inflation. And there's a lack of sturdy international investment, Parsi added

NIAC pushed the Iran deal among other pro-Iran initiatives.

The only article CNN had this morning was one that matched the Iranian news service: Iran Protests: Government Supporters Join Counter Rallies. The photo they used was from the Tasnim News Agency as Mike Cernovich pointed out.

There were only about 2,000 in that rally and far more throughout the nation rallying against the regime and tearing down Khamenei's posters.

The last several CNN articles are making the protests about Trump. They have a one track mind. It's not about Trump, it's about the corruption of the regime.

All the neverTrumpers are also out against freedom for Iranians because Trump supports it.

I told you this would happen. Never Trumpers are OPPOSING freedom for Iranians just because Trump supports it. Let that sink in. https://t.co/SOUc2G4f8W — Raheem 🇬🇧🇺🇸 (@RaheemKassam) December 31, 2017

Sohrab Ahmari, a former WSJ writer and currently at Commentary Magazine, said these protests are real, not scattered uprisings. As he tweeted, this is a regime that uses rape and acid attacks, yet thousands are in the streets throughout the country.

Don't buy the claim that #iranprotests are "scattered": 10,000 came out in Mashhad, my sources say. In Mashhad—a conservative and pious city—that's huge! And these people aren't braving a mild autocrat like Mubarak in Egypt. This is a regime that uses rape and acid attacks. — Sohrab Ahmari (@SohrabAhmari) December 30, 2017

Yesterday, in the city of Hamadan, protesters chanted: "Death to Russia, Death to Russia!"

This is from the Islamic State of Iran Crime Research Center:

Rightside Broadcasting has up-to-date information:Alcides Pacífico Hilbe tiene las marcas de décadas de trabajo en una metalúrgica impresas en su cuerpo. No lo dejan vivir tranquilo. Un dolor punzante le inmoviliza uno de sus hombros. Y todo el tiempo, todos los días, escucha un zumbido en los oídos, como si llevara en auriculares la máquina que operó durante los 30 años de su vida laboral. Su jubilación no es ni un premio ni un descanso. Parece más un padecimiento al que, durante un tiempo, encontró una salida. Fue gracias a su peluquero. El hombre, experto evidentemente en la cabeza humana, le regaló una semilla de cannabis. "Esto te podría ayudar", le avisó sin muchas más explicaciones. Hilbe buscó la data que faltaba en Internet, tiró la semilla en el jardín de su casa de Villa Constitución, Santa Fe, aprendió a cuidarla, a quererla y a cortarla en el momento justo y al cabo de unos meses fumó por primera vez marihuana de su jardín. Su cuerpo lo sintió enseguida: el hombro se relajó y el ruido interior bajó su volumen hasta ubicarse en un segundo plano.Esa misma amiga, demostró su indignación con lo sucedido también en las redes sociales: "Me da vergüenza decir que fuiste mi amiga durante años, saber que para Navidad me dijiste que te había matado a palo, donde hiciste que te agarre cuando yo venía así me peleaba con él. Sos una hija de puta, no te mereces nada, solo pudrirte en la cárcel por asesina", afirmó la amiga que había participado en esa agresión.Protesters in Iran who have staged three days of demonstrations over economic hardship and alleged corruption should pay a high price if they break the law, the government said on Sunday.

The wave of anti-government demonstrations in several cities are the biggest challenge to Iran's leaders since unrest in 2009 that followed the disputed re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad went on for months.

Police in Tehran fired water cannon on Sunday to try to disperse demonstrators gathering in Ferdowsi Square in the centre of the capital, according to video footage posted on social media. Video posted online also showed a clash between protesters and police in the city of Khoramdareh in Zanjan province in the country's northwest. There were also reports of protests in Sanandaj and Kermanshah cities in western Iran.

Two protesters were shot dead in the western town of Dorud on Saturday night. The deputy governor of Lorestan province blamed foreign agents for the deaths.

"No shots were fired by the police and security forces. We have found evidence of enemies of the revolution, Takfiri groups and foreign agents in this clash," Habibollah Khojastehpour said in an interview on state television on Sunday. Takfiri is a term for Sunni militants especially the Islamic State.

State media also quoted Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli as saying: "Those who damage public property, violate law and order and create unrest are responsible for their actions and should pay the price."

Brig-Gen Esmail Kowsari, the Revolutionary Guards' deputy security chief in Tehran, said the situation in the capital was under control and warned protesters would face "the nation's iron fist" if unrest persisted.

"If people came into the streets over high prices, they should not have chanted those (anti-government) slogans and burned public property and cars," he said.

Ahmad Khatami, a hardline cleric who leads Friday prayers in the capital Tehran, said the protests were similar to those in 2009 over alleged electoral fraud.

He called for capital punishment for those chanting slogans against the values of the Islamic Republic.

The protests have included chants and slogans against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the clerical leadership in power since 1979 revolution.

Videos posted on social media showed people chanting: "Mullahs, have some shame, let go of the country."

Protests defied the police and Revolutionary Guards who have used violence to crush previous unrest because they are motivated by economic grievances and have no clear leader.

They are also difficult for the government of President Hassan Rouhani because he was elected on a promise to guarantee rights to freedom of expression and assembly.

Mr Rouhani's main achievement, a 2015 deal with world powers that curbed Iran's nuclear program in return for a lifting of most international sanctions, is yet to bring the economic benefits the government promised.

Unemployment rose to 12.4 per cent this fiscal year up 1.4 percentage points, according to the Statistical Centre of Iran.

Saturday's protests coincided with state-sponsored rallies staged across the Islamic Republic to mark the final suppression of the 2009 unrest by security forces, with mass pro-government events in Tehran and Mashhad, Iran's second city. –ReutersNo final do ano passado, a Polícia de Segurança Pública (PSP) tinha 14 sindicatos, mas este ano o número já aumentou para 15 e em marcha está já a criação do décimo sexto.

A quantidade de sindicatos existentes na PSP constitui uma forte ameaça à operacionalidade desta força policial, tendo em conta o número crescente de dirigentes e delegados que têm direito por lei a dispensa de serviço pela actividade sindical, avança o "Jornal de Notícias" na edição deste domingo, 31 de Dezembro.

Daí que, devido ao período crítico do Natal e Ano Novo, o Sindicato dos Profissionais de Polícia (SPP) tenha decidido, de acordo com a informação constante no seu site, proibir os seus associados de usarem as "dispensas de serviço para actividade sindical entre 22 de Dezembro de 2017 e 2 de Janeiro de 2018".

No ano passado, refere o mesmo diário, foram registadas 31.153 folgas justificadas para actividades sindicais, com base numa legislação desajustada da realidade.

"Não faz sentido a forma como as coisas se encontram", pelo que "é preciso alterar rapidamente a legislação anterior", alerta Mário Andrade, presidente do SPP, em declarações ao "JN".

"Como a lei está, até uma simples esquadra pode criar um sindicato, E claro que, correspondentemente, surgem os dirigentes e os delegados sindicais. Isto descredibiliza a actividade sindical", reconhece Paulo Rodrigues, presidente da ASPP, o maior sindicato na PSP.

A lei permite que os dirigentes tenham quatro dias por mês e os delegados 12 horas mensais para o desempenho destas funções.

A proposta para a nova legislação que poderá alterar este cenário está parada há mais de um ano na Assembleia da República.

A "Proposta de Lei 46 XIII" chegou ao Parlamento em Novembro do ano passado, pela mão da anterior ministra da Administração Interna, Constança Urbano de Sousa, mas não tem ainda sequer debate agendado.

Essa proposta de lei prevê a criação de uma fórmula de proporcionalidade em que o gozo dos quatro dias fica limitado a um dirigente por cada 200 associados.Success!

Volunteers put up the fencing at Kirkland's Lake Washington United Methodist Church. The church runs a "Safe Parking" program, where 40-50 women and families stay in cars in the parking lot.

"Huge deal," said Cheryl, one of the church's guests. (She asked we not use her last name.) She and her dog, Shiloh, live in the backseat of her VW Jetta.

Cheryl said health issues make it difficult for her to keep up with Shiloh. The off-leash area helps.

"To be able to get her out of the back seat, to have her be able to romp and play and run free for a while," beamed Cheryl.

The dog park is the latest feature of the Safe Parking program. The women can use the church's kitchen and Wi-Fi daily. Church members donate food and toiletries. If temperatures outside get below freezing, the women can sleep inside on the church's pews. The guests said they needed to pass a background check to become a part of the Safe Parking program.

Fences for Fido is a Portland-based non-profit that has an Olympia chapter.

"The fact that the church has stepped up and is utilizing their facilities to help these women makes it even more important that we step up and help them keep their pets because their pets are their family and their friends," said Michele Coppola of Fences for Fido.

The non-profit hopes they can open a chapter in King County soon.

Ocurrió ayer, después del mediodía, en las oficinas de Sarmiento y 25 de mayo. Un grupo de delincuentes que vestían como si fueran empleados de una empresa de seguridad sonora ingresaron a la Bolsa de Comercio, redujeron a la vigilancia y tras abrir algunas cajas fuertes se hicieron con el botín. Aún se desconoce de cuánto es el faltante y no hay novedades de los delincuentes.

De acuerdo a la Policía de la Ciudad, el asalto ocurrió alrededor de las 14, cuando "dos personas con ropa de la empresa encargada del sistema de alarmas del edifico de la Bolsa de Comercio de la Ciudad redujeron al personal de seguridad". "Inmediatamente ingresaron a dos oficinas propias del organismo y a otras tres que se alquilan a empresas privadas", se describió.

Una vez que los vigiladores fueron atados con precintos y alojados en una oficina, sin sufrir lesiones, se presume que habrían ingresado al inmueble otros ladrones más - en total serían unos seis - con elementos para violentar cajas fuertes, indicaron las fuentes consultadas por La Nación. Interviene la Unidad Criminalística y de Investigaciones de la Policía porteña.We were driving east out of Otay Mesa when my phone buzzed with a text message from T-Mobile. "Welcome to Mexico!" it read. I slid the phone back into my pocket. The wide street we were on, Via de la Amistad, soon turned into a dirt road. The SUV I was riding in, with a pair of officers from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, bumped along for another five minutes or so before we pulled into a long, open field.

We hadn't actually driven into Mexican territory, as I far I knew. Yet my phone's confusion seemed to mirror my own. Lined up in the middle of the expanse of dirt where we'd stopped, now visible in a perfect row, were eight prototypes of the border wall that President Trump has promised to build between the United States and Mexico.

I'd been working for a few days to arrange a visit to the prototypes, which are being tested and evaluated by the federal government through early next year. They were designed and fabricated by six firms — not engineering giants like Bechtel or AE Com but for the most part homegrown companies including W.G. Yates & Sons of Mississippi and Fisher Sand & Gravel of Arizona. (One entry is by the North American arm of ELTA, an Israeli defense contractor.) To get permission to see them, I'd had to convince a CBP public-affairs officer that my interest in the subject was genuine — and my professional experience germane.

The opening line of his email reply to me had taken the form of a question: "What is an architecture critic?" I'd sent back a long and I'm sure insufferably earnest definition of my job, explaining that I see my beat as including nearly every part of the built environment. This corner, I added, is a whole lot more politically and symbolically potent than most.

Yet as I climbed out of the SUV and began walking toward the eight sections of wall, each about 30 feet wide and 30 feet high, I wondered if he'd been right to be surprised by my interest. All of a sudden my critical instincts seemed divided against themselves. The slabs in front of me seemed at once the most and least architectural objects I'd ever seen. They were banal and startling, full and empty of meaning. Here were the techniques of Land Art, medieval construction, marketing and promotion, architectural exhibition and the new nativism rolled uncomfortably if somehow inevitably into one.

From the start, Trump's presidential campaign and his pledge to build the border wall were so intertwined as to be nearly synonymous. He made his first official version of the promise during the news conference announcing his White House bid, which took place in the windowless lowest level of Manhattan's Trump Tower on June 16, 2015. (According to the Hollywood Reporter and other news outlets, at least some of the people cheering the announcement had been paid to be there, provided to the campaign by a casting company called Extra Mile.) After some opening boasting that will now strike most Americans as familiar — "Wow. Whoa. That is some group of people. Thousands. ... This is beyond anybody's expectations. There's been no crowd like this." — Trump vowed to "build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words."

Fairly quickly, as Trump rose in the polls, that promise began to bump up against some real-world limitations. Mexico wasn't going to pay for the wall, no matter how many times Trump announced it would. Nor, since he took office, has Congress seemed inclined to fund anything close to the whole project, which carries an estimated price tag of somewhere between $12 billion and $70 billion. (The House, but so far not the Senate, has passed a 2018 budget that includes $1.6 billion in border-wall funding.) There are long stretches of territory — along the Rio Grande and in areas where most borderland parcels are in private hands, to name two — where erecting a wall would be practically if not literally impossible.

In Trumpworld, that hardly mattered. What mattered was the brilliant battering-ram simplicity of the wall as political weapon — a blunt idea for a blunt candidate. After eight years of coolly detached rhetoric from Barack Obama, a politician whose perspective could seem Olympian to a fault, Trump's advisors guessed that the electorate was ready for something more direct, even more tribal. Something far closer to the ground.

The slabs seemed at once the most and least architectural objects I'd ever seen. They were banal and they were startling, full and empty of meaning.

The wall became the marker of that shift in tone. The monosyllabic phrases Trump's crowds chanted at various rallies — "Lock her up," taunting Hillary Clinton, as well as "Build that wall" — made up a rhetorical foreshadowing of the prototypes themselves. The point in both cases was to suggest something drastic or even shocking in the plainest of terms. Not to gild the quotidian but the opposite: to make the outlandish, the improbable or the hostile sound like the most routine, achievable thing in the world.

It's often said that the most basic form of architecture is shelter. There's a famous illustration on the frontispiece of Marc-Antoine Laugier's "Essay on Architecture," a staple of Architecture 101 college syllabi, showing two tree branches lashed together to form a pitched roof: the so-called Primitive Hut. Yet it's possible to pare the idea down further. In the simplest sense, human beings build two kinds of things in the world. We build connective things and we build protective things. We build tunnels and we build walls.

Tunnels suggest connection but also rule-breaking and escape. Walls suggest not just division but authority and control. Tunnels are about expanding the number of paths in the world. Walls are about limiting that number. Tunnels are stateless; walls give shape to statehood. Each is made in a fundamental sense out of a desire to outsmart the other.

It was hardly surprising, then, that the CBP's guidelines for the prototypes included the requirement that they be strong enough to repel attempts to tunnel beneath them to a depth of 6 feet. Each also had to be able to withstand a half-hour of attack by "sledgehammer, car jack, pick ax, chisel, battery-operated impact tools, battery-operated cutting tools, oxy/acetylene torch or other similar hand-held tools." CBP had divided the wall samples by material: There were walls made of concrete and walls made of something, as the guidelines put it, "other than concrete."

As for their looks? This was the most surprising thing of all. When I first caught sight of them from the SUV, I worried about making even basic distinctions among them. They looked virtually identical. But as I spent more time in this odd open-air architecture gallery, it became clear that the aesthetic spectrum the prototypes covered was very wide.

The one furthest east, by Fisher Sand & Gravel, was the idea of a wall stripped to its essence, suggesting a kind of accidental minimalism, a section of a Peter Zumthor facade after a trip through the federal bureaucracy. Made of three panels that matched almost perfectly the color of the dirt at its feet, it was the simplest of the group and also — at $365,000 — among the least expensive to produce.

A very different sensibility was evident in the slab designed by ELTA. Its bottom half was concrete, its upper half metal. The concrete section (though only on the side facing the U.S., per the official guidelines) was painted white and blue, as if it were covering a split-level ranch house outside Phoenix.

Also in this decorative vein was the concrete wall by Texas Sterling Construction, which featured a white faux-brick pattern stamped into its American side. The argument these two walls made was pragmatism à la HGTV: that any piece of construction could be humanized, even made cheerful, with some measured, cost-effective ornament.

Adding to the strangeness of the setting was the fact that these prototypes for a new border wall overlooked the imperfect real thing. Running along the southern edge of the field where they were arranged was a genuine stretch of border fence, a sagging, pockmarked barrier made of rusting corrugated metal.

I'm sure that section of wall, built in the 1990s, looked shiny (and maybe even robust) when it was new. But time and nature had taken their toll. If the three-panel concrete prototype by Fisher Sand & Gravel looked as though it had risen straight from the earth, the existing fence seemed to be slowly returning to it.

As I kept examining the prototypes, more variety emerged. There were perfectly straight walls and humpbacked ones. Some were solid. Others had vertical metal bars along the base, making it possible to see easily through them.

What the prototypes didn't resemble, in any practical sense, was a wall. (A swatch of fabric is not a shirt; a lone panel from an umbrella won't keep you dry when it rains.) It wasn't just that they suggested Potemkin slices, architectural stand-ins to match the human ones Trump's campaign invited to the news conference kicking off his White House bid.

Because they'd been put up with gaps between them — the better to appreciate the differences from one design to the next — they offered no sense of enclosure or completeness. This gave the whole display a surprising and ironic twist: the way the prototypes were arranged struck me as emblematic of the limits of Trump's border-security aspirations. They were prototypes of a wall that will likely, for practical reasons as well as political ones, always be as notable for its gaps as for its consistent protection.

What is an architecture critic? Maybe an architecture critic is somebody who goes to see slices of concrete and steel in a big field and comes back to report what's so self-evident, even obvious, that it threatens to remain unsaid: that these sections of wall are better understood for their collective symbolism than as competing entries in a genuine design competition.

That as a group — eight slabs and seven spaces-between-slabs — they enact, with surprising precision, the southern border wall that we already have and probably always will, the one we're eternally displeased with and yet condemned to keep building. That what we're producing is a strange hybrid of wall and tunnel, just as I was in the United States while my phone told me I was in Mexico: something that both frustrates and enables connection, that makes plain that a border is at once the place where we're separated from another country and where we're joined to it.

A barrier made of alternating bands of substance and absence, aspiration and impossibility. Here wall, here no wall. Here something, here nothing. And on and on across the desert.

The Hogwarts Effect: College buildings look straight out of Harry Potter's worldLive

Here's our look at the Trump administration and the rest of Washington.In 2017 my husband, Ralph, and I moved 23 times. It wasn't difficult because our house has wheels.

Two years ago, we decided to buy a 28-foot motor home and hit the road full-time, but our lifestyle change really began in 2009, when we realized that we couldn't hold on to our home in San Diego. My husband was semi-retired, and I was working in the increasingly beleaguered newspaper business.

First we moved to Washington state, where I procured a job at a paper in a tiny town in the east Cascades. We got tired of the snow and isolation and headed back to California. We found house-sitting and caretaker gigs, and I was freelancing when we decided we needed a place of our own. Buying a house, even renting an apartment in California was financially out the question. But a used motor home was within our budget.

We were both AARP members. We'd already jettisoned the stuff you build up over living for a long time in one place. We were prepped for something completely different. Our kids were all for it; our friends, not so much. More than one thought we were a little crazy. But as it turns out, living full time in an RV is not all that unusual. Now we're sort of homeless, and we love it.

It's better to be counting your pennies on the road than in what passes as an affordable house or apartment in almost any U.S. city.

The Recreation Vehicle Industry Assn. estimates that there are between 100,000 and 200,000 full-time or extended-stay RVers on America's roads at any one time, but it's tricky to calculate. Some people are pure vacationers, in and out of RV parks. Others are stationary in their motor homes. I don't consider them RVers exactly because they are using their motor homes as shelter and nothing more.

Plenty of young families are on the move, like we are. They're towing 1960s Airstreams or piloting brand new Winnebagos (RV sales are at record highs). But the people who are usually our fellow travelers are in their 50s, 60s or beyond: retired or something close to it, but not exactly living a leisure life.

According to Wand'erly, an RV magazine I follow on Instagram, nearly half of us who travel more or less full time live on less than $30,000 a year. We work freelance jobs or do "work camping" — picking up $7 to $12 an hour packing boxes at a nearby Amazon warehouse or making change behind the counters at national parks. Some work at the RV park for a discount on daily fees. I know RVers who time their travels to pick sugar beets during the harvest along the border of North Dakota and Minnesota.

My husband and I have a routine that's common. We find a place we like that is affordable and stay for a few months at a time. On average, a spot at an RV park anywhere other than the West Coast costs about $500 a month. In San Diego, the prices are about $1,000 a month, still about half the rent of a small apartment. If need be, we head for the hills and camp off the grid, as "boondockers," until some money comes in.

When the weather turns cold, most RVers pull in their awnings and drive to a park full of amenities along the Colorado River, or to Florida, to spend the winter. Thousands head to Quartzsite, Ariz., where there are inexpensive ($20 a night) and very basic campsites, or boondock at Bureau of Land Management desert sites. We park at Elks Clubs quite often, which offer basic hookups for not much money. It's a short walk to the club bar and very safe. The point is, when you live in an RV, as long as you have money for gas, you can move on down the road.

This sounds ghastly to a lot of people, but I don't know why. On a small budget, I can drink my morning coffee beneath the red cliffs of Utah or on the beach at Santa Barbara. I can chat with travelers from all over the world. And from one week to the next, I can be hiking in the Colorado Rockies or strolling through a redwood grove. I may not be at the apex of the career ladder, but they don't call this semi-retirement for nothing. Besides, sitting on the couch watching my stocks dive up and down on CNN all day, or going on a cruise or two before I die, isn't for me.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the over-65 set is expected to be the fastest-growing demographic in the workplace by 2024. So why shouldn't our work require just a few hours each day moving boxes in a warehouse or raking leaves or cleaning a toilet or two at the RV park? I recently met an 87-year-old man who has been moving from campground to campground as a host/maintenance man — greeting guests as they check in, making minor repairs on buildings and keeping restrooms in working order — for 20 years. He was about to finish a gig at Santee Lakes in San Diego County and looking forward to the next one at the Red River Ranch Campground in New Mexico, where he planned to live and work until summer.

For some RVers, it's a difficult life of scrimping and saving. I've been there a few times myself, but when you wake up surrounded by pines trees and catch sight of an eagle overhead, you realize it's better to be counting your pennies on the road than in what passes as an affordable house or apartment in almost any U.S. city.

I still write to make money about six hours every day, and I hope to be doing it for a very long time because I love it. My husband, at 70, receives Social Security and works as a handyman for friends and family when we are in their vicinity. Otherwise he bikes and hikes and kayaks until the sun sets.

We have a small nest-egg saved for whichever one of us goes into a nursing home first, and we don't touch it — not for new tires, engine repairs or wine. The full-time RV life isn't always easy, and things don't always go as planned, but living on the fly has brought us closer together and given us an opportunity to wake up to something new every day.

Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and FacebookThe debate over eliminating the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes — a linchpin of the Republican tax cut plans now working their way through Congress — has focused on the economic and political effects of the change. But that may be the wrong discussion. The question is whether eliminating the deduction is even constitutional. History suggests that it's not.

The most cogent analysis of this issue comes to us from the grave — specifically, from the late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.). Moynihan addressed the issue in a 1985 speech, later published in the political science journal Publius.

Leaders of states that rely on state and local income taxes for a large share of their revenue, including California, have threatened to bring a legal challenge to a tax bill that eliminates the deduction. They would do well to take their lead from Moynihan.

There are arenas of government that must not be invaded by other governments. The late Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, 1985

At the time of his speech, the state and local tax deduction was under attack by the Reagan administration, which like today's GOP, was looking for ways to pay for a tax cut for the rich. Moynihan labeled the idea "a profound constitutional error."

Moynihan drew his argument from the principle of federalism enshrined in the Constitution, the essence of which is that "there are arenas of government that must not be invaded by other governments." He observed that the notion that this applied to taxation had been understood dating back to the origins of the federal income tax, enacted under Abraham Lincoln to finance the Civil War.

The Revenue Act of 1862, Moynihan noted, provided that federal tax liability was to be calculated only after state and local taxes were first deducted, "and this under the most pressing emergency conditions ever faced by our country." The deduction was enshrined in the Revenue Act of 1913, which created the modern federal income tax.

A few contemporary commentators have noticed that eliminating the SALT deduction, as it's known today, invades local prerogatives. Progressive pundit John Stoehr wrote recently that the change would be "a violation of the states' rights the Republicans say they alone represent." At the other end of the ideological spectrum is Stan Veuger, a fellow of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who called the deduction "a linchpin of the federalist system," which "expresses our preference for local solutions to local problems."

But that's definitely a minority approach. Virtually the entire debate over the current tax cut bills has treated the SALT deduction as just another loophole, akin to the mortgage interest deduction, that favors the wealthy. The political component of the discussion relies on the fact that the states with the highest percentage of residents claiming the deduction — such as California, New York, New Jersey and Maryland — tend to vote Democratic. In our denatured political discourse, the idea that Republicans in Congress would turn their gun sights on Democratic states is seen as sort of adorable.

It's also commonly argued that, insofar as the deduction is most heavily concentrated in big, urban states, it's tantamount to a "subsidy" of blue states by their poorer red neighbors.

Moynihan, a New York Democrat, albeit one who wasn't averse to taking a conservative stance on issues from time to time, had little regard for these arguments. He thought it inaccurate to label the deduction a "tax expenditure" — a term used to describe giveaways to favored groups through the tax code. "I do not think we should let the Treasury Department get away with calling it a federal 'subsidy,' " he added. "In diplomacy, this is known as semantic infiltration: if the other fellow can get you to use his words, he wins."

In any event, the notion that other states "subsidize" big blue states through the SALT deduction happens to be wrong. As New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli demonstrated in a 2016 study, the "subsidy" generally goes in the other direction: The states with the largest state and local tax burdens typically paid out more to the federal coffers than they received in return. The states with the biggest outflow were those on the West Coast and Northeast, and those receiving the largest inflows tended to be Southern states with low state and local taxes.

Another principle Moynihan discussed was the issue of "double taxation." Interestingly, an aversion to "double taxation" is frequently cited by Republicans and conservatives to justify reducing or eliminating taxes on dividends — dividends already are taxed once as corporate income, so why should they be taxed again when they're received by shareholders.

Big states with high state and local taxes tend to be net contributors to federal coffers, shown here in red. The majority (green) get more from the federal government than their residents pay. (New York State Comptroller )

But eliminating the SALT deduction would be a more far-reaching example of double taxation, Moynihan said, citing a resolution by the National League of Cities calling the deduction "a fundamental statement of the historical right of state and local governments to raise revenues and of individuals not to be double taxed." As it happens, the Supreme Court has spoken on the issue of double-taxation: It's wrong. In a 2015 decision written by Justice Samuel Alito, the court ruled that a Maryland provision denying its taxpayers credit for taxes paid to other states was unconstitutional. Expect the states' challenges to the GOP tax bill to cite that ruling (Comptroller vs. Wynne) prominently.

In 1862, Moynihan noted, Rep. Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont, then chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, warned that eliminating the SALT deduction would "perplex and jostle, if ... not actually crush, some of the most loyal States of the Union." Moynihan called it a "huge and final irony" that eliminating the deduction would transfer more resources to the federal government, allowing it to grow larger — exactly the outcome that the advocates of "small government" in the Republican congressional caucus say they don't want.

Moynihan and his colleagues managed to defeat the Reagan administration's effort to eliminate the SALT deduction. Subsequent efforts also failed. At this moment, the GOP plan to take an ax to the SALT deduction looks like a juggernaut. But history and the Constitution may say otherwise.

Return to Michael Hiltzik's blog.D'emblée, on affirme qu'il n'y a pas de statistique sur le nombre de jeunes faisant appel aux cliniques canadiennes, et que l'idée qu'il existerait des enfants transgenres n'est qu'une mode nourrie par des activistes LGBTQI qui font appel à l'idéologie plutôt qu'à la science. La réalité est tout autre et ce type de propos souligne le manque de connaissances du psychologue. Rappelons que les ordres professionnels exigent de la part de leurs membres qu'ils aient une connaissance approfondie du sujet afin de se prononcer publiquement. Dans ce cas, M. Dallaire démontre une méconnaissance des recherches canadiennes des dix dernières années ainsi que celles en cours, menées par plusieurs des signataires de cette lettre. De plus, ces projets sont subventionnés par les grands conseils de recherche aussi bien fédéraux que provinciaux.

L'âge

L'entrevue insinue également que l'identité de genre ne deviendrait certaine que vers l'âge de 20-25 ans, même plus tard durant «l'adulescence», terme employé par M. Dallaire, et que les enfants vivent beaucoup de pression pour «changer de sexe» rapidement. Nous tenons à corriger cette idée. Le jugement professionnel, les données probantes et l'éthique sont au cœur des interventions et personne ne fait pression sur ces enfants pour aller dans un sens ou dans un autre. Par contre, le bien-être de l'enfant est au cœur de nos interventions.

D'ailleurs les recherches les plus récentes sur le sujet indiquent que l'identité de genre se manifeste beaucoup plus tôt que ce qui est énoncé durant l'entrevue, soit vers 3-4 ans, et se précise vers l'âge de 7-8 ans. De plus, les traitements médicaux qui pourront être offerts à l'adolescence sont considérés comme sécuritaires, et sont totalement réversibles afin de justement permettre aux jeunes d'explorer plus librement leurs besoins au niveau de leur identité de genre.

Le travail se fait aussi avec les parents. En effet, notre expérience clinique et la recherche confirment qu'il n'est pas rare pour un parent de vouloir retarder l'intervention médicale, et non la précipiter, comme semblait le suggérer l'entrevue. Les recherches sur l'expérience des parents d'enfants trans nous permettent d'affirmer qu'au contraire, les parents vivent souvent un choc lorsqu'ils découvrent la situation, et prennent parfois des années avant d'accepter la différence que présente leur enfant.

L'environnement

Lors de l'entrevue, il a été mentionné que les jeunes trans sont beaucoup plus à risque de vivre de la détresse, de l'anxiété, ou de se suicider. En effet, les études confirment que les jeunes trans vivent une importante détresse. Par contre, ces risques ne sont pas associés à l'identité de genre, mais sont causés par des environnements non accueillants, par le manque d'acceptation sociale, la transphobie, et la violence.

Par exemple, les jeunes qui vivent aux Pays-Bas ont une meilleure santé mentale que leurs voisins de la Belgique, du Royaume-Uni et de la Suisse; les auteurs de cette étude attribuent cette différence à l'ouverture à la diversité de genre qui influencerait positivement leur bien-être. Mais peu importe où l'enfant vit, les recherches démontrent aussi très clairement que lorsque les jeunes peuvent compter sur le soutien de leurs parents et que les parents respectent l'identité de genre de leur enfant, le taux de suicide diminue de 93 % et leur santé mentale rejoint celle des jeunes cisgenres (non-trans). En d'autres mots, la recherche montre que de permettre aux enfants de vivre dans une société qui les accepte, de les soutenir et les aimer, peu importe leur genre affirmé, sont des facteurs de protection importants.

La chirurgie

Si l'entrevue avec M. Dallaire semblait soutenir que les personnes trans qui décident d'avoir recours à des chirurgies sont souvent insatisfaites après l'intervention, l'ensemble des études sérieuses sur le sujet démontre le contraire. Le mythe de l'insatisfaction après la chirurgie est véhiculé par des groupes d'extrême droite qui ont été condamnés par la majorité des groupes professionnels autant en Amérique du Nord qu'ailleurs au monde. La preuve scientifique n'est plus à faire: l'accès aux traitements médicaux visant l'harmonisation du corps à l'identité de genre de la personne trans est essentiel au maintien d'un bien-être, menant à une réduction importante de la détresse et des taux de suicide chez ces populations.

L'orientation

L'entrevue avec M. Dallaire fait référence à un «lobby» de militants qui influencerait les pratiques cliniques auprès des jeunes trans. Cet énoncé n'a aucune validité et une fois de plus ignore les données scientifiques qui indiquent que, tout comme l'orientation sexuelle, l'identité de genre, qui se précise bien avant la puberté, ne peut être modifiée. Aujourd'hui, de nombreux regroupements professionnels reconnaissent le danger des thérapies dites «correctives», qui nient ou tentent de modifier l'identité de genre de la personne. Des associations telles l'Association américaine des psychologues, l'Association américaine pédiatrique, l'Association canadienne des travailleurs sociaux, l'Association canadienne de psychologie, et le World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) encouragent plutôt les interventions qui visent à soutenir les jeunes et leur famille dans un processus d'acceptation, et soulignent que d'essayer de modifier l'identité de genre d'une personne représente une importante faute éthique, car cette démarche n'est pas soutenue par la science.

La majorité des jeunes qui ont affirmé une identité de genre différente de celle assignée à la naissance ne «changent pas d'idée», pas comme le mentionnait l'entrevue. Par exemple, une étude européenne confirme que sur 70 jeunes dont l'identité trans a été confirmée par des professionnels en début de puberté, 100 % de ces jeunes ont poursuivi avec la transition à l'âge adulte. L'accès à l'intervention psychosociale et médicale affirmative agit encore une fois comme facteur de protection important pour ces jeunes.

Une idéologie

En conclusion, et à la lumière des recherches actuelles sur le sujet, il nous apparait que plusieurs informations rapportées dans cette entrevue ne sont pas conformes aux données probantes les plus récentes sur le sujet et paradoxalement, les idées proposées semblent davantage reposer sur l'idéologie que la science. À titre d'experts reconnus dans le domaine, nous tenions à corriger ces informations qui peuvent grandement nuire aux familles qui tentent de soutenir leurs enfants, et aux jeunes qui ne veulent que s'épanouir dans la société québécoise.

Dre Françoise Susset, psychologue et thérapeute conjugale et familiale, cofondatrice de l'Institut pour la santé des minorités sexuellesΜετά το τουρκικό υπουργείο Εξωτερικών, βαριές κουβέντες κατά της Ελλάδας απηύθυνε ο αντιπρόεδρος της τουρκικής κυβέρνησης Χακάν Τσαβούσογλου με αφορμή την παροχή ασύλου στον έναν από τους οκτώ Τούρκους αξιωματικούς που ήρθαν στη χώρα μας με ελικόπτερο μετά το πραξικόπημα της 15ης Ιουλίου 2016.

Με μηνύματα που ανέβασε στο Twitter, ο τούρκος αντιπρόεδρος αφήνει σαφείς απειλές. Στο ένα γράφει ότι «δεν έχουν αντιληφθεί πόσο μεγάλος κίνδυνος είναι για την Ελλάδα και τον ελληνικό λαό κάθε μέλος της FETÖ που αφήνεται ελεύθερο», προσθέτοντας πως «δεν ωφελεί κανέναν μια εικόνα της Ελλάδας στην οποία συνωστίζονται οι τρομοκράτες».

Σε άλλο ο κ. Τσαβούσογλου αναφέρει πως, «εμείς έχουμε χρέος να τους προειδοποιήσουμε από τώρα φιλικά, αλλά η απόδοση ασύλου δεν είναι καθόλου φιλική στάση» και κλείνει λέγοντας, «οι τρομοκράτες που αφήσατε ελεύθερους σήμερα είναι σαν δυναμίτης έτοιμος να εκραγεί και όταν εκραγεί μπορεί να μην μείνει χώρα για να προστατεύσετε».Justice Department officials should launch a "serious investigation" of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private server and email address to conduct official U.S. business, according to Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. The probe should include the "obvious violations of law" by her top aide, Huma Abedin, he also said.

The violations to which Fitton refers were the five emails marked "classified" that were found among 2,800 work-related emails by the FBI on a laptop owned by Abedin and her now disgraced and estranged husband, former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.).

The emails were made public Friday in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit Judicial Watch filed in March 2015. The 2,800 emails were among thousands found by the FBI that spurred the bureau to reopen its investigation in October 2016 and raise new questions about the Clinton team's mishandling of classified information on the private server.

[lz_ndn video=33354374]

"This is a major victory," Fitton said in a statement. "That these government docs were on Anthony Weiner's laptop dramatically illustrates the need for the Justice Department to finally do a serious investigation of Hillary Clinton's and Huma Abedin's obvious violations of law."

He added, "After years of hard work in federal court, Judicial Watch has forced the State Department to finally allow Americans to see these public documents. It will be in keeping with our past experience that Abedin's emails on Weiner's laptop will include classified and other sensitive materials."

After Weiner found himself at the center of a sexting investigation, Abedin filed for divorce.

The classified and heavily redacted emails discovered on Weiner's computer concerned discussions about Hamas, the Palestine Liberation Organization, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and United Arab Emirates officials. Other emails emphasized Clinton's continued interest in politics while she served as the country's top diplomat.

A State Department spokesperson said it "carefully reviews the content of records requested through FOIA to determine whether any information is sensitive or classified" when it noted Friday that several of the Abedin emails contained "classified information that has been redacted," Politico reported.

The 2,800 emails released Friday returned the spotlight to the FBI's handling of the Clinton email investigation during the 2016 presidential election. Former FBI Director James Comey closed the bureau's Clinton investigation in July 2016, while noting that the failed Democratic candidate and her aides had been "extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information."

Earlier in December, President Donald Trump told reporters that "it's a shame what's happened" with the FBI and the results of its "really disgraceful" investigation into Clinton's private email server usage.

"We're going to rebuild the FBI. It'll be bigger and better than ever, but it is very sad when you look at those documents, and how they've done that is really, really disgraceful, and you have a lot of very angry people that are seeing it," Trump said.

Veganism thrived in 2017 with extraordinary jumps in interest, availability, innovation, and sales, all over the world. There were documentaries like What the Health and films like Okja that shook people to the core. Social media was abuzz with vegan food tutorials and cruelty-free beauty. It's clear that people are happy and willing to make positive changes, especially given that Veganuary — a charity that aims to inspires folks to eat vegan in January and onwards— has received, already, over 100,000 sign-ups.

A post shared by Veganuary (@weareveganuary) on Dec 30, 2017 at 10:30am PST

They've got a vegan starter guide, they dispel common myths about veganism, they'll help you shop vegan at the supermarket, and even make sure you're good to eat out at restaurants and fast food joints. With over 100,000 people currently signed up, this will be the biggest Veganuary yet... and there's still more people signing up all the time.

In fact, they've reported that 1 person is signing up every 6 seconds! Veganism is no longer niche. Rather, it's something that more and more people are willing to embrace, especially as plant based foods become increasingly accessible.Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says Gabriel Jesus is likely to be missing for between one and two months after he suffered an injury in the 0-0 draw with Crystal Palace.

The Brazilian pulled up inside 20 minutes and tried to play on before being replaced by Sergio Aguero soon after.

But the City boss had better news on Kevin De Bruyne, who was stretchered off during added time after going down under a heavy challenge from Jason Puncheon.

Guardiola says the Belgian's injury isn't as bad as perhaps was initially feared but admits he is unlikely to play against Watford in two days' time.

"Hopefully he [Gabriel Jesus] will be one month, maybe two months he will be out," he said. "With Kevin we have been lucky in the past with what has happened from the same actions. I don't know what will happen in the future.

"He may not be ready for Watford in a few days."

Guardiola added that he wants to see players better protected by referees.

"Please, referees, they have to protect players," he said. "We were lucky against Tottenham and against Newcastle. Today we were not lucky.

"Referees have to protect. We know how strong physically it is England but teams miss big players, not just Manchester City. The replay speaks for itself. We have to protect players."

We will bring you more information on Gabriel and Kevin as we get it right here on mancity.com in the coming days.

Meanwhile, Guardiola says his focus now is on breaking our own record for consecutive Premier League wins.

The draw with Palace brought to an end our 18-match winning run, one short of equalling the best sequence in top-flight European history, currently held by Pep's Bayern Munich side.

It's a staggering run that has seen City establish a 14-point lead going into the new year – and Guardiola wants to see it bettered in 2018.

"We set a record in Premier League but next one we will try to beat," he said. "We are in December, there are lots of games to play."

The time has come for Marco Asensio at Real Madrid, and Zinedine Zidane knows it after a turning point in the Clasico on December 23.

Whilst some will remain untouchable in his team, others could lose their spot, and the French coach knows that he must make changes to the role that some players have in his squad.

Upcoming Copa del Rey fixtures will give fringe players a chance to shine after limited chances in the first half of the season, and Asensio could be one of those to benefit.

A large proportion of Madrid fans are calling for him to be given more minutes.

The former Mallorca sensation had been brought in to be a superstar of the present and future for Real Madrid, and his end to the previous campaign and start to this season looked as though he was ready to deliver.

However, it hasn't quite happened and he has, instead, found himself watching on from the bench, something which has left both fans and the player bewildered.

Hopes for the Spaniard are so high that directors have stopped any potential move for Chelsea's Eden Hazard.

"Why would we bring in the Belgian if we have Asensio?" one senior board figure said in a meeting.

Hazard is a player that Zidane likes, and he has done ever since he played in Lille.

Now, the Chelsea man is even offering himself to Los Blancos.

However, Real remain focused on the development of Asensio, who they believe must play in the most important games, something which he may have less chance of doing with Hazard in the ranks.

Asensio himself is calm, his feet are on the ground and that has helped him to handle his rise to fame.

He wants to play more, but he knows his role in the squad and he is convinced that his time will come.

That could be now.President Donald Trump speaks at tool manufacturer Snap-on Inc. in Kenosha, Wis., Tuesday, April 18, 2017. Trump visited the headquarters of tool manufacturer Snap-on Inc., and later signed a an executive order that seeks to make changes to a visa program that brings in high-skilled workers. AP

The Department of Homeland Security is considering new regulations that would prevent H-1B visa extensions, according to two U.S. sources briefed on the proposal. The measure potentially could stop hundreds of thousands of foreign workers from keeping their H-1B visas while their green card applications are pending.

The proposal, being drafted in memos shared between DHS department heads, is part of President Donald Trump's "Buy American, Hire American" initiative promised during the 2016 campaign.

The administration is specifically looking at whether it can reinterpret the "may grant" language of the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act to stop making the extentions. The act currently allows the administration to extend the H-1B visas for thousands of immigrants, predominantly Indian immigrants, beyond the allowed two three-year terms if a green card is pending.

"The idea is to create a sort of 'self- deportation' of hundreds of thousands of Indian tech workers in the United States to open up those jobs for Americans," said a U.S. source briefed by Homeland Security officials.

Officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is under DHS, said they can't discuss "any part of the pre-decisional processes."

"The agency is considering a number of policy and regulatory changes to carry out the President's Buy American, Hire American Executive Order, including a thorough review of employment-based visa programs," said Jonathan Withington, chief of media relations for USCIS.

The proposal is part of a series of new regulations the Trump administration is taking at the same time a bipartisan group of lawmakers moves forward on legislation to tighten rules that award visas to H-1B holders. The administration also has announced plans to end work eligibility for spouses of H-1B holders. In addition, the administration is considering changes to the allocation of H-1B visas to give priority to more highly educated and skilled workers.

While the H-1B issue doesn't draw the same attention as other immigration-related policy deliberations, such as building a wall across the southern border, it is significant to American employers. Tech giants such as Facebook and other big companies, from Bank of America to Caterpillar, have long argued that the 85,000 annual cap on these visas is too low and that they need to bring in more foreign tech workers because they can't find enough highly-skilled American workers.

On the other side, critics of the program say H-1B visas are increasingly being abused and that American workers are being laid off as U.S. companies send work to outsourcing companies that employ thousands of H-1B workers.

Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order calling for a review of the H-1B program in order to suggest changes to ensure the most skilled and highest–paid applicants receive H-1B visas. "This historic action declares that the policy of our government is to aggressively promote and use American-made goods and to ensure that American labor is hired to do the job. It's America first, you better believe it," Trump said in April when announcing the executive order.

John Miano, a lawyer who represents American workers who say that they have lost jobs unfairly to low-skilled H-1B visa holders, said Trump can only do so much to fix H-1B program, which he said should be scrapped.

"You can throw a dart at a random provision in H-1B and delete and probably improve the problem," he said.

Miano said he would welcome limits to the number of years. He has proposed pulling back the number to even three years. But expected that ultimately Congress would need to approve such a change.

The H-1B visa is typically issued for three to six years to employers to hire a foreign worker. But H-1B holders who have begun the green card process can often renew their work visas indefinitely.

The proposed changes would have a dramatic effect particularly on Indian visa holders considering more than half of all H-1B visas have been awarded to Indian nationals, according to the Pew Research Center.

Lawyers who represent the workers and companies expect lawsuits to be filed if changes to the program were sought without Congressional approval.

"This would be a major catastrophic development as many people have been waiting in line for green cards for over a decade, have U.S. citizen children, own a home," said Leon Fresco, who served as a deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department in the Obama administration who now represent H-1B workers.

Fresco estimates more than 1 million H1-B visa holders in the country are waiting for green cards, many of whom are from India and have been waiting for more than a decade.Longtime volunteers Luke and Hudson Elegant, right, greet diners at the Miami Rescue Mission's Great Thanksgiving Banquet. The brothers have been committed to helping others through the organization every since they were just 9 and 6 years old. Photo provided to the Miami Herald

Brothers Luke and Hudson Elegant have been volunteering for the Miami Rescue Mission for eight years. That's a long time for anyone to give back to one organization. But these guys are shining examples of how children can learn early to help others.

They began their commitment when they were just 9 and 6 years old.

Luke is now 17 and a junior at Ransom Everglades School. Hudson is 14 and a freshman at Phillips Academy Andover. Each Thanksgiving, they lead a team of volunteers to raise money and serve meals to the homeless.

This year, through generous contributions and participation from other volunteers they were able to raised a record-breaking $11,739.22 for the Miami Rescue Mission.

That contributed to the nearly 3,000 meals served at the Nov. 23 Great Thanksgiving Banquet, healthcare, haircuts, hygiene products and 9,000 articles of clothing for the hungry and homeless.

And, perhaps best of all, a reported 70 men and women decided to get off the streets and enter the Miami Rescue Mission's life-changing program, the brothers said in their thank-you message to volunteers.

"I am so proud of my sons' [longtime] commitment to helping others and would love to build awareness and inspire others to volunteer," said their mom Jennifer Elegant in an email. "Their commitment to this organization has made such an impact on their lives, especially given how young they were when they started."

The brothers' volunteering began as a one-day commitment in 2009 but evolved into an annual Thanksgiving tradition that they share with more than 40 family members and friends, as well as the thousands of strangers they help.

The Miami Rescue Mission assigns eight Thanksgiving team captains each year and they were the youngest team members when they started. Now, they are the youngest team captains.

Luke and Hudson begin by recruiting volunteers each summer. Over the past few years they have supervised more than 150 volunteers and raised over $25,000. This year, they were also selected to be captains of the Dec. 22 Christmas event.

"I volunteer to create positive change," said Luke in an email. "People are faced with different obstacles throughout their lives, but I vehemently believe that these challenges should not define them."

"I think a person who is homeless should not be ostracized or looked down upon, but rather be embraced and given the chance to succeed and find happiness. Doing community service gives me the opportunity to improve the lives of others in my community, something that I have always prioritized and felt extremely passionate about."

The Miami Rescue Mission cares for the homeless every day of the year by providing shelter, clothing, toiletries, showers, haircuts, medical care, counseling, job training, and free Miami Dade College classes. It truly is a life-changing organization. Jennifer Elegant said it has also changed her family.

"Thanksgiving for Luke and Hudson, and now for our whole family and many of our friends, has become much more than a one-day celebration," she said. "Sharing Thanksgiving with the Miami Rescue Mission over the years has transformed Thanksgiving into a year-round passion for giving back. As a result, Luke and Hudson truly believe in and support the Miami Rescue Mission's vision that 'no one is homeless.'"

Gifts for Boys & Girls Club

Miami Beach resident Timothy Sykes surprised 200 children at the Boys & Girls Club of Miami-Dade with gifts and a $25,000 donation for the center's after-school program.

The entrepreneur visited dressed in his blue "Hanukkah Harry" costume and greeted each child with a special toy to celebrate the season. This is the second year Sykes has given back to the Boys & Girls Club during the holidays.

"For me, the holidays are about giving back," Sykes said in an email. "I work with a lot of charities around the world year-round, but it's also important to support your local community, especially during the holiday season when it's difficult for a lot of families to be able to afford gifts for their children. The look on these kids' faces is heartwarming. I am honored to support Boys & Girls Clubs of Miami-Dade and all of the great work they do to support our youth."

"It's a great day when you can see the smile on the kids' faces and the excitement that one toy can bring to them," said Ronny Vera, Unit Director of Boys & Girls Club of Miami-Dade in an email. "I know they are going to remember this day for a long time to come."

As a philanthropist Sykes has helped build schools in Cambodia, Bali, Laos, Ghana, Thailand and Nepal, and is dedicated to "providing and improving education opportunities to people living in third-world countries." He has also worked with the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

Milepost 31 was located in Seattle's Pioneer Square Historic District from December 2011 to November 2017. The center provided an inside look at the history of the neighborhood and the engineering behind the SR 99 tunnel. It was created as part of an agreement to address Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, which requires agencies to take into account the effects of their projects on historic properties, such as those in the Pioneer Square neighborhood.

Start the tour above or jump to a section in the exhibit at one of the thumbnails below. You can also check out a couple of videos at the bottom of the page.Ahed Tamimi, a 16-year-old Palestinian girl, was recently arrested in a night-time raid on her home. The Israeli authorities accuse her of "assaulting" an Israeli soldier and an officer. A day earlier she had confronted Israeli soldiers who had entered her family's backyard. The incident happened shortly after a soldier shot her 14-year-old cousin in the head with a rubber bullet, and fired tear-gas canisters directly at their home, breaking windows.

Her mother and cousin were arrested later as well. All three remain in detention.

There has been a curious lack of support for Ahed from Western feminist groups, human rights advocates and state officials who otherwise present themselves as the purveyors of human rights and champions of girls' empowerment. Ahed, like Malala, has a substantial history of standing up against injustices.











Their campaigns on empowering girls in the global South are innumerable: Girl Up, Girl Rising, G(irls)20 Summit, Because I am a Girl, Let Girls Learn, Girl Declaration.

When 15-year-old Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai was shot in the head by a member of Tehrik-e-Taliban, the reaction was starkly different. Gordon Brown, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, issued a petition entitled "I am Malala." The UNESCO launched "Stand Up For Malala."

Malala was invited to meet then President Barack Obama, as well as the then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and addressed the UN General Assembly. She received numerous accolades from being named one of the 100 Most Influential People by Time magazine and Woman of the Year by Glamour magazine to being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2013, and again in 2014 when she won.

State representatives such as Hillary Clinton and Julia Gillard as well as prominent journalists such as Nicholas Kristof spoke up in support of her. There is even a Malala Day!

But we see no #IamAhed or #StandUpForAhed campaigns making headlines. None of the usual feminist and rights groups or political figures has issued statements supporting her or reprimanding the Israeli state. No one has declared an Ahed Day. In fact, the US in the past has even denied her a visa for a speaking tour.

Ahed, like Malala, has a substantial history of standing up against injustices. She has been protesting the theft of land and water by Israeli settlers. She has endured personal sacrifice, having lost an uncle and a cousin to the occupation. Her parents and brother have been arrested time and again. Her mother has been shot in the leg. Two years ago, another video featuring her went viral – this time she was trying to protect her little brother from being taken by a soldier.

Why isn't Ahed a beneficiary of the same international outcry as Malala? Why has the reaction to Ahed been so different?

There are multiple reasons for this deafening silence. First among them is the widespread acceptance of state-sanctioned violence as legitimate. Whereas hostile actions of non-state actors such as the Taliban or Boko Haram fighters are viewed as unlawful, similar aggression by the state is often deemed appropriate.

This not only includes overt forms of violence such as drone attacks, unlawful arrests, and police brutality, but also less obvious assaults such as the allocation of resources, including land and water. The state justifies these actions by presenting the victims of its injustices as a threat to the functioning of the state.

Once declared a threat, the individual is easily reduced to bare life – a life without political value. Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben has described this as a time/place sanctioned by sovereign power where laws can be suspended; this individual can therefore now be made a target of sovereign violence. Terrorists often fall within this category. Thus, the execution of suspected terrorists through drone attacks without due judicial process ensues without much public uproar.

The Israeli police have deployed a similar strategy here. They have argued for extendingAhed's detention because she "poses a danger" to soldiers (state representatives) and could obstruct the functioning of the state (the investigation).

Casting unarmed Palestinians like Ahed – who was simply exercising her right to protect her family's wellbeing with all the might of her 16-year-old hand – in the same light as a terrorist is unfathomable. Such framings open the way for authorising excessive torture – Israel's education minister Naftali Bennett, for instance, wants Ahed and her family to "finish their lives in prison."

Ahed's suffering also exposes the West's selective humanitarianism, whereby only particular bodies and causes are deemed worthy of intervention.

Anthropologist Miriam Ticktin argues that while the language of morality to alleviate bodily suffering has become dominant in humanitarian agencies today, only particular kinds of suffering bodies are read as worthy of this care.This includes the exceptionally violated female body and the pathologically diseased body.

Such a notion of suffering normalises labouring and exploited bodies: "these are not the exception, but the rule, and hence are disqualified."

Issues of unemployment, hunger, threat of violence, police brutality, and denigration of cultures are thus often not considered deserving of humanitarian intervention. Such forms of suffering are seen as necessary and even inevitable. Ahed, therefore, does not fit the ideal victim-subject for transnational advocacy.

Relatedly, girls like Ahed who critique settler colonialism and articulate visions of communal care are not the empowered femininity that the West wants to valourise. She seeks justice against oppression, rather than empowerment that benefits only herself.

Her feminism is political, rather than one centred on commodities and sex. Her girl power threatens to reveal the ugly face of settler-colonialism, and hence is marked as "dangerous". Her courage and fearlessness vividly render all that is wrong with this occupation.

Ahed's plight should prompt us to interrogate our selective humanitarianism. Individuals who are victims of state violence, whose activism unveils the viciousness of power, or whose rights advocacy centres communal care, deserve to be included in our vision of justice.

Even if we don't launch campaigns for Ahed, it is impossible for us to escape her call to witness the mass debilitation, displacement and dispossession of her people. As Nelson Mandela said, "We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians."

Labour is warning of a fresh Universal Credit crisis next year.

Its analysis shows the number hit by deductions is 20 times higher than for other benefits.

Department for Work and Pensions statistics show the number with a Universal Credit deduction reached 6.9% in March this year.

For Employment and Support Allowance and Jobseeker's Allowance, the deduction rate was 0.3% and 0.4%.

Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Debbie Abrahams said the crisis will worsen as the credit roll-out quickens next year.

Then hundreds of thousands of working people must meet criteria to be eligible for the benefit.

"The Tories should fix Universal Credit before it causes even more misery for families," she insisted.

"It is shameful that the sanctions rate for Universal Credit is now 20 times higher than for other forms of social security.

"With more and more low-paid workers becoming subject to conditionality, this is a crisis that is only set to deepen if the Tories continue to press ahead with their botched roll out of Universal Credit."Get the biggest politics stories by email Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email

Theresa May is reportedly planning to axe up to a quarter of her Cabinet in the next few weeks as she tries to cling to power.

Five of her 21 Cabinet ministers have been tipped for the sack and others could be shunted to new roles, it is claimed.

She repeatedly held on to her current line-up this year amid fears a shake-up would destabilise her vulnerable position.

But her leadership has been buoyed by securing a first-round Brexit deal with the EU.

And she will be forced to act because the Cabinet Office position she sacked ally Damian Green from is still vacant.

Now Education Secretary Justine Greening, Tory chairman Patrick McLoughlin, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling are all tipped for the chop.

The four ministers are named by both the Sun on Sunday and the Sunday Times. The latter adds Business Secretary Greg Clark is tipped to lose his job.

It's also reported that Boris Johnson could be asked to take up a 'supercharged Brexit delivery job' in the business department.

But his allies told the Sunday Times this would be a demotion that he would fight.

Those tipped for promotions include Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who could take Damian Green's place.

Others who could reportedly be promoted include Dominic Raab, Damian Hinds and Brandon Lewis.

Sources told the two newspapers a reshuffle is due in January 2018.

The ministers involved have serious controversies to their name.

Mr Grayling has faced calls to quit today from former infrastructure tsar Lord Adonis over a "bailout" to private firms running the East Coast rail line.

Ms Leadsom, who stood for the leadership against the PM, has been accused of positioning herself prominently including turning up to the site of the Grenfell Tower fire when Mrs May failed to.

The briefings themselves could spark a damaging battle in Mrs May's Cabinet just as they resume talks on the 'end state' of Brexit.

David Cameron 's former spin doctor Craig Oliver warned: "Aides briefing on reshuffles causes mayhem - angry ministers start demanding private reassurances and counter-briefing begins.

"Soon someone asks: are we sure we *really* want to do this?"PESHAWBESTOWN, MI - Visibility was near zero today as parts of Grand Traverse and Leelanau counties got socked with snow. But some people near Suttons Bay got to see a winter waterspout form over Grand Traverse Bay.

James Lawson took these shots behind the casino near Peshawbestown.

It was an unusual sight Saturday afternoon, amid the lake effect snow storm.

Some who saw the pictures on social media were calling it a "snow tornado."

Water spouts can form over big bodies of water in the winter. The conditions need to be right, with colder air blowing over the warmer water beneath it, creating instability. Add some rotation to this warm air rising, and you've got a water spout.Policiales

Asesinaron de 5 disparos a un policía en el Cordón

Dos hombres en moto abordaron al policía, que se encontraba en la puerta de un comercio hablando con otra persona.

Un efectivo policial fue asesinado de cinco disparos por dos individuos que descendieron de una moto y fueron directamente a atacarlo.

Fuentes policiales informaron a Montevideo Portal que el policía se encontraba en la puerta de un comercio ubicado en Mercedes y Gaboto dialogando con una persona cuando se detuvo frente a ellos una motocicleta con dos hombres.

Uno de ellos descendió del vehículo e intentó abordar al policía, que intentó resistirse y forcejeó con el atacante.

Finalmente, el asaltante logró hacerse del arma y efectuó cinco disparos al agente.: uno impactó debajo de su clavícula, tres en su axila izquierda y otro en el brazo derecho.

El policía, de 45 años e iniciales L.E.M.N., fue trasladado al Hospital Policial, donde falleció minutos después.

En tanto, la mujer que conversaba con el agente también recibió dos disparos. Fue trasladada a un centro asistencial pero se encuentra fuera de peligro.

Los investigadores procurarán analizar las imágenes captadas por las cámaras de seguridad en la zona para intentar identificar a los atacantes.

Montevideo Portal2018. Angela Washko (b. 1986, Reading, PA. Lives in Pittsburgh, PA.)

The Game: The Game takes the form of a dating simulator, pitting you against six men who are aggressively vying for your attention at a bar. These characters are based on real-life "seduction coaches" who offer tips and techniques—ranging from confidence building to psychological manipulation—that teach men how to interact with women for the primary purpose of quickly engaging in sexual encounters.

Composed entirely of scenarios, techniques, and language from texts and instructional videos created by these seduction coaches, The Game: The Game flips the script on the iterative processes of some of the world's most prominent pick-up artists. If their techniques are systematically manipulative, The Game: The Game allows you to tactically explore, expose, and defuse them. But it also makes you complicit in their frequently dehumanizing behavior: refusing their advances results in a brief game. Only by actively consenting to participate in your suitor's methods—which can range from cheesy to violent—will you be able to more fully understand them. The game is at turns funny and alarming, an experience heightened by a disorienting original score from Xiu Xiu.

The Game: The Game is the product of several years of research by artist Angela Washko in the pick-up artist (PUA) community. Sorting through this often troubling material, she rejects the polarizing language that frequently surrounds PUAs, offering a nuanced view of power and desire in the complex world of contemporary sex and dating by giving players the opportunity to experience these systems firsthand. The world premiere of the complete The Game: The Game arrives at a galvanizing moment as the United States engages in a wide-ranging public conversation about the pervasiveness of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace and state house.

The Game: The Game is exhibited with The Game: The Game Research Reel (2018), a compilation of hidden camera footage, instructional videos, and conference recordings by seduction coaches that highlights some of the actual techniques, scenarios, and language that were included in the game.As 2017 comes to a close, let's look back at the year for the Islanders and forward to an exciting 2018.

A New Head Coach Is Named

In the first few weeks of 2017, the Islanders said goodbye to Jack Capuano and hello to Doug Weight, who took over behind the bench as the interim head coach. The team finished out the season winning six straight games, but came up one point short of getting into the playoffs.

When the season ended, the Islanders announced that Weight would remain the team's head coach and it's been fun to watch him continue to mold his team.

He's had a strong relationship with many of the players for several years and seems to really connect with them. Weight is straightforward and expects a lot from the team. He is emotional, smart and has surrounded himself with a coaching staff full of former NHLers carrying invaluable playing experience.

It has been a strong start to the season, and as the Isles approach the halfway point, there are high expectations for 2018.

Anders Lee Is On Fire

Anders Lee hit his stride in December 2016 and hasn't looked back since. The Isles' top line winger is thriving and will ring in the New Year with 24 goals through 38 games. Yes, you read that correctly! What's even more impressive is that he's scored a total of 44 goals in 2017 AND that's more than John Tavares! Lee shows no sign of slowing down and the combination of him with Tavares and Josh Bailey is rock solid for the Islanders.

An Early Gift for Islanders Fans

For much of 2017, Isles fans have worried about the future of the blue-and-orange. Specifically, where would their team play long-term? Well, that big question was answered the week before Christmas. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the Islanders won the bid to build a brand-new arena at Belmont Park. I think it's a win for everyone!

[Fischler: Islanders Win Race Back 'Home']

The players will be taking the ice closer to where they live, and closer to their state-of-the-art practice facility. The fans will be able to get to and from the arena by driving or taking the train. This makes it an easier commute for those that live out in Suffolk County, many who have missed out on going to games in Brooklyn because of the distance.

The new location will still make it easy for fans living in the New York metro area, too.

I had faith that Jon Ledecky and the Islanders would find a way to get a deal done. Now, the anticipation of the new arena will keep us occupied in 2018!

Now lets look ahead for what to watch in 2018.

Barzal-Arama

Mathew Barzal burst onto the NHL scene in October but in 2018, I think we will see the rookie at his best. He is dazzling to watch and knocked off several NHL firsts already. Barzal's hat trick and an overtime game-winner in back-to-back games have many shaking their heads in wonderment.

[Ranker: Barzal's Greatest NHL Firsts]

But he's also one of the most competitive players I've encountered. I know they all have to be competitive to make it at this level, but there's something special inside Barzal. He won't be satisfied until he wins the Calder Trophy and helps the Isles to a long run in the playoffs. I feel as if we are watching a superstar develop right in front of our eyes.

Metro Showdown

Speaking of the 2018 playoffs, I know it's a few months away but I don't expect the race to loosen up at all. If you take a look at the standings, it's tight with just a few points separating first and fifth in the Metropolitan Division. That's without the Penguins in the picture.

My good friend and colleague Stan Fischler, predicts the Pens will be the team to fear in the second half of the season. I agree they will shift into high gear, but I think it will be a battle to the final game to solidify who's in and who's out of the playoffs. I have a good feeling the Isles will stay on course and make it to the postseason this go around.

O Captain! My Captain!

With the Belmont decision made the next big question for Isles fans is John Tavares. People ask me almost daily if I think he will stay or go. My answer has been the same since last season. I'm not worried at all.

Tavares has said time and time again that he likes playing for the Isles and hopes to work something out with the organization he was drafted by. I did speak with him at the Belmont Park press conference and had an even better feeling that he was in it for the long haul. I would be surprised if the captain made a decision public before the summer, but don't sweat Isles fans. I think he wants what we all want ... to win a fifth Stanley Cup for this storied franchise.

On a personal note, I'll always look back at 2017 as one of the most exciting times in my life. I got engaged to my best friend, Brendan Gorey, at the end of March. We met at an Islanders game just two years before our engagement and my life will never be the same. We are looking forward to many years of happiness together and plan to get married in Ireland, July 21, 2018. I can't wait to say YES! YES! YES!Sometimes, there is a certain element that can take a song to another level, and according to Pusha T, Kanye West had a very specific idea about the secret ingredient needed to make "Runaway" a memorable track. The G.O.O.D. Music MC recently revealed to MTV News that 'Ye was adamant about packing as many "douche bags" into their collaboration as possible.

"I'm writing a verse, and I come back to the table, and it's something that I'm feeling, and he's like, 'Naw, but I need more douche bag.' And I'm like, 'All right, man, c'mon.' So I go back, and he's like, 'Naw, more douche bag!' He's screaming at me 'more douche bag' at this point," Push said during his "RapFix Live" interview Thursday (November 18) about crafting the douche-bag-toasting standout from 'Ye's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. "I just really had to, like, take myself out of it a little bit and then put ... the perspective of the guy ... who thinks he can fix it, but he's not being preventative."

Push said the song developed organically but that Yeezy had unexpectedly stumbled upon a subject the Clipse MC was very familiar with: the art of douche-baggery.

"It starts from a conversation. We're talking, and he's like, 'I like your perspective on that. Put a verse to that.' What he didn't know was [that] I was going through my own relationship turmoil at the time," Push revealed. "I was being a douche bag," he said, adding, vaguely, that he was doing "whatever wrong you can do" in a relationship.

Although the concept arose naturally enough, Push said 'Ye was relentless about making the final product just right.

"I've never worked with anybody like him," Push said. "He just pushes you and pushes you and pushes you. With 'Runaway,' I think I wrote that four times."

While Yeezy lab sessions had their moments of intensity, Push said developing a partnership with the G.O.O.D. Music impresario easily grew out of an excursion to West's tropical outpost.

"It started from a three-day trip to Hawaii," he said of becoming a part of the G.O.O.D. Music fold. "It was supposed to be a three-day trip, [and] it ended up being a month, just collaborating on his album. The 'Runaway' song was done, a couple of the G.O.O.D. Friday joints were done. 'So Appalled' was done. It was just a vibe thing. We got in there, and we just started vibing."

Push said Yeezy was also confident that joining forces with the Virginia spitter would be a partnership with the potential to shut down the game — or at least the 2010 MTV VMA stage, where the pair premiered the record.

"He was just [like], 'You know we about to kill this, right? It's about to be a real problem. This is gonna be, like, one of the biggest moments right now,' " Push remembered. "He was like, 'C'mon, the record's crazy, I'm debuting it here. When people see us together, we about to shock. We about to hurt some people.' "

Some problem occurred. Try Again!A fleet of Uber self-driving cars at a technology demonstration in September 2016. (Aaron Josefczyk/Reuters)

Autonomous vehicles are about to collide with the American way.

Editor's Note: The following piece first appeared in the December 18, 2017 issue of National Review.

At some point in the future, be it years, decades, or a century hence, the federal government will seek to ban driving.

This, I'm afraid, is an inevitability. It is inexorably heading our way. The dot sits now on the horizon. As is common, the measure will be sold in the name of public health. "Now that robots can do the work," its bloodless advocates will explain, "there's no need for human involvement." And from then: On, the snowball will roll.

Each time there's a bad accident, the utilitarians will squeal: about the stupidity of the American people; about the enormity of theretofore innocuous groups — "F*** AAA!"; about the antediluvian "fetish" that is costing American lives. "In Sweden," they will gripe, "they already . . . " Besides, we regulate trains and airplanes. Why can't we outlaw the driver's license?

Our debate will rest largely upon charts. The American Medical Association will find "no compelling reason to permit the citizenry to drive," and Vox will quote it daily. Concurring in this assessment will be The New England Journal of Medicine, the Center for American Progress, and the newly rechristened Mothers against Dangerous Driving, for which outfits "dangerous" will have become a lazily supplied synonym for "human." Atop this endless statistical beat will be a steady stream of mawkish anecdotes. "Joey was just 17." "Sarah had three kids." "Not a day goes by in which . . . " And pushed into the corner, as "flacks" and "extremists" and the owners of bloodstained hands, will be the dissenters. "But what," they will ask, "about liberty?"

As usual, the opponents of prohibition will be correct. Indeed, the threat to individual freedom that the driverless car is set to pose is at this stage hard to comprehend. For a century, the automobile has been a bastion of liberty, freeing up almost everybody from the tyranny of other people's schedules. Trains, planes, and even taxis are run to their owners' clocks: I cannot tell Amtrak to pick me up at 9; Delta won't stop in Fayetteville if I ask nicely; yellow taxis have a habit of disappearing in the rain. But the car — oh, the car. The car is mine. I can get in my car when I want, and get out when I want. I can oversleep or undersleep, and still it sits there waiting, as might a Labrador or a loyal slipper. My car has no luggage restrictions, and I know exactly what it'll fit. In my car, I may play what I want on the radio. And, best of all, I may choose the other passengers.

Advertisement

Crucially, I need no special permission to drive my car — at least not beyond a basic license and a plate screwed into the back. At my choosing, I can go around the block, or I can go to California. Nobody cares. There are no tickets, no inspectors, no medallions to subsidize. If I want, I can use a satellite or a map to help me find my way, or recruit my smartphone to the cause of cutting traffic. But I don't have to. In fact, I don't have to have a clue where I'm going, or a clue when I'll get there, or to remember where I've been. I can get happily, gloriously, deliriously lost — a weekender shuffling toward nowhere. My car, God bless it, has no logbook, and no timetable. It is a steel extension of my feet.

Advertisement

Will it remain these things if I am no longer allowed to drive it? The answer, of course, is "No." For starters, I would likely not own one in such circumstances. Why would I, when it would sit unused for most of the time without any of the benefits that currently attend? Where would be the advantage in my having one, as opposed to calling an Uber or a taxi or a Lyft? To be reliant upon a computer in the sky is to be reliant upon someone else. After a while, only the rich would justify the luxury.

Regardless, everyone will suffer from the catastrophic loss of privacy. Any network of self-driving cars would, by definition, necessitate total and unceasing tracking of their occupants. I may know how to get to the local liquor store without a map, but my car most certainly does not. To make it there in a driverless model, I'd first have to tell it where I was going, and then it would have to ask the Internet, and the satellites, and, probably, my credit card. To the existing framework we would thus be adding a planet-wrapping exoskeleton with a perfect digital memory. The car, far from serving as a liberator, would become a telescreen on wheels — an FBI-approved bug, to be slipped beneath the chassis in plain sight of the surveilled. At a stroke, my autonomy would be gone. Without permission from the Web, I would be lost in space. A mere server glitch could render me immobile. The government, should it so choose, could stop me dead in my tracks. Yet again, I would be handing over my self-reliance to the government and to the corporations, and asking, plaintively, "Please sir, may I move?"

I refuse. The poet Richard Brautigan longed for "a cybernetic ecology where we are free of our labors and joined back to nature, returned to our mammal brothers and sisters, and all watched over by machines of loving grace." I refuse to be so co-opted, or to be forced under the peering eyes of a machine, however "loving" or "graceful" its acolytes might believe it to be. Indeed, I do more than refuse: I propose a legal prophylactic against this nightmare, to be adopted now, before it can come to fruition. As soon as possible, it must be illegal for the state to take steps in this direction. We must amend the Constitution to ensure as much.

The Constitution of the United States is not there to ossify much-disputed social rules, or to settle more permanently what is better resolved in statute. That, inter alia, was the grand lesson of the failure of Prohibition. But this, I'd venture, does not fall into either category. This is more fundamental. The genius of the Bill of Rights lies in its protection of broad categories of human conduct, and, by extension, whatever tools are necessary for their exercise. By design, there is no reference to Twitter or to typewriters or to churches in the First Amendment, no mention of muskets or AR-15s in the Second, nor to filing cabinets or hard disks in the Fourth. Those are the mere details — the flesh on the bone. What matters in each case is the act in question: speech, dissent, and conscience in the First; self-defense in the Second; privacy in the Fourth, and so on.

The root question is whether free people are to be permitted to move themselves around without needing somebody else to agree to the transaction, or whether the government may interpose itself.

So it is here. In truth, the coming debate over driving is not really about driving at all, but about movement, autonomy, and reliance upon one's self. Which is to say that the root question is whether free people are to be permitted to move themselves around without needing somebody else to agree to the transaction, or whether the government may interpose itself. This, naturally, is a perennial inquiry, not a contingent one. It would have been as pertinent in 1790 if there had been an anti-horse movement, and it will be necessary when the car has been replaced with the jetpack, or the rotocopter, or whatever is coming our way. May I move myself, or may I not?

There is no Ludditism embedded in this instinct, nor is there any intolerance. Those who choose to abandon their licenses and surrender to Brautigan's "cybernetic ecology" would absolutely be free to do so. Legal, too, would be cars capable of being driven and of driving themselves. The amendment would merely protect the rights of those who will inevitably dissent from the Borg. "Congress shall make no law," it might read, "restricting adults from driving licensed vehicles."

Such a modification would have no bearing on the "shall issue" licensing regime that currently obtains in all 50 of our states, nor would it impugn the safety regulations that attach to self-driven automobiles. It is reasonable to test competency before permitting drivers on the public roads, and it is fair for the state to ensure that wheels are wheels and engines are reliable and airbags work upon request. Rather, the amendment would merely prevent the in toto prohibition that is inevitably going to be floated. It is not the role of government to force a free people into a dependency that they had happily escaped, or to radically alter their capacity for rapid movement in a culture that everywhere presupposes it. The designer Raymond Loewy recorded that "the American automobile has changed the habits of every member of modern society." So it has — and vastly for the better. Uncle Sam, and SkyNet, must back the hell away.

Getting together with friends and neighbors is an essential part of our democratic society

'Americans of all ages, all conditions, all minds constantly unite."

When French historian Alexis de Tocqueville visited the United States in the 1830s, he came away fascinated with the non-political community organizations Americans had created:

Not only do they have commercial and industrial associations in which all take part, but they also have a thousand other kinds: religious, moral, grave, futile, very general and very particular, immense and very small; Americans use associations to give fêtes, to found seminaries, to build inns, to raise churches, to distribute books, to send missionaries to the antipodes; in this manner they create hospitals, prisons, schools.

These groups, clubs, and organizations, de Tocqueville noted, played a role in society that was unique to the United States. While other countries relied on the government, Americans relied on each other.

"Everywhere that, at the head of a new undertaking, you see the government in France and a great lord in England, count on it that you will perceive an association in the United States," he wrote.

That grand tradition of forming associations and building strong communities continued for more than a century. Americans created organizations such as Kiwanis, supper clubs, Shriners, churches, bowling leagues, the PTA, the Elks, ladies' associations, and countless others.

Each year, groups like these raised thousands of dollars for local charities and volunteered countless hours. They met needs and worked for change far more efficiently than any government program ever could. Associations were essential to limited government, as de Tocqueville pointed out.

They also brought politically diverse individuals together to form close-knit communities. It's hard to believe that everyone with different political views than your own is evil when you go bowling with some of them on Friday nights.

It's hard to believe that everyone with different political views than your own is evil when you go bowling with some of them on Friday nights.

But attend one of those clubs' events today and you'll immediately notice something: Their members are getting older, and no one is replacing them.

Since the height of social clubs and civic organizations in the 1960s, membership has more than halved. The Elks boasted 1.6 million members in 1976. By 2012, there were around 800,000 Elks nationwide. In 1964, the Parent Teacher Association boasted 12 million members. By 2016, membership had plummeted to fewer than 4 million.

Political scientist Robert Putnam first raised the alarm about this trend in his 2000 book Bowling Alone. He named the book after discovering that participation in league bowling had dropped 40 percent in just over a decade.

Putnam conducted exhaustive research on Americans' socializing habits, and his findings are deeply concerning. Americans, he concluded, are isolating themselves.

In the 25 years before Putnam published Bowling Alone:

‐The number of Americans who had attended a club meeting had dropped nearly 60 percent.

‐The number of people who had family dinners had dropped more than 40 percent.

Advertisement

‐The number of people who had friends over had dropped by more than 30 percent.

Our communities are coming apart at the seams, and for freedom-lovers, that should be alarming. Community is one of the key institutions in society, along with government, business, and education. A healthy, vibrant community of connected individuals is essential to freedom.

When voluntary community associations begin to fail, government grows. Tocqueville believed that if government steps in to play the role communities once did, "it will exercise an insupportable tyranny even without wishing to." But an ever-growing government won't be able to effectively replace the "innumerable multitude of small undertakings that American citizens execute every day."

This fracturing of community organizations has helped increase political polarization. In the past, neighbors with competing political views could meet at the Elks Lodge for beers, come together on the PTA to raise money for the local school, or worship together in church.

Today, most Americans have few or even no friends with worldviews that differ from their own. Distrust and even loathing of people with opposing political views is rapidly growing, and people are reading and watching their own side's news almost exclusively.

People cut friends and family members out of their lives because of their political views. The communities we do join — such as social-media groups and political clubs — are filled with people who think, act and live much like us.

Sharing freedom and changing hearts and minds, which depend on forming real relationships with people who disagree with us, is almost impossible in a climate like this. You can't convince people that freedom is the answer if you don't know any of them.

As 2018 approaches, let's make a recommitment to our communities. Let's find that social club, civic organization, or bridge game, that PTA or softball team, and make an effort to step outside our comfort zone and build relationships with the people who live down the street. After all, being together is so much better than bowling alone. And it just might help you build a stronger community and save the country.

One of the mottos of the Navy SEALs is "the only easy day was yesterday." Retired SEAL Jeff Bramstedt, a 13-year veteran of the teams, has clearly taken the quote to heart.

Bramstedt, who owns Skydive San Diego, saw a plea on Facebook from the relative of a friend in Colorado who had a life-threatening disease and required a liver transplant.

"I stopped many years ago living my life for me and constantly looking for a way I can be a blessing for someone else, a miracle for someone else and this seemed to fit that really well," he told NBC 7.

Earlier in December Bramstedt flew to Aurora, Colorado to meet Melinda Ray, a mother of three, with whom he had no connection beyond the Facebook post.

During a 10-hour surgery at the University of Colorado Hospital, doctors removed 30 percent of his liver and transplanted it inside Ray.

"I love her with everything I have, we share an organ at this point, so it's kind of the closest thing you can have to a blood sister," Bramstedt explained. "I'd do anything for her, I'd do anything for that family. We've become really close over the past few weeks."

Doctors expect both of their livers to regenerate into fully functioning organs.

Bramstedt hopes his story inspires others to consider giving of themselves in this extraordinary way.Access Denied

Senate Bill 539 was strongly opposed by the drug and pharmacy representatives. It requires the state Health and Human Services Department compile a list of drugs essential to treat diabetes and the drugs on that list that have seen significant price increases in the past two years. That list would be public.

It also requires the manufacturer of those drugs to submit to the department an annual report about the cost of the drugs, list those that have significantly increased in price and the reason for the increase.

It further requires organizations that advocate for patients or medical research to provide information about what payments, donations and other things of value they've received from drug makers and pharmacy benefit managers.

Also effective Monday is SB474, a sweeping attempt to deal with the opioid addiction crisis.

The bill would limit initial opioid pain prescriptions to just a 14-day supply, require doctors and other professionals who prescribe pain medications to have solid reasons for prescribing, conduct an assessment of the patient's vulnerability to addiction and develop an evidence based diagnosis and treatment plan.

SB474 further says no patient should be prescribed those drugs for more than a year and requires a documented explanation why they're exceeding 365 days if necessary.

Backers of the plan, which Gov. Brian Sandoval listed as one of his priority measures in the 2017 Legislature, say it doesn't prevent patients from getting appropriate medications but establishes good practices for prescribing them.

Several laws revamping and strengthening controls over guardianships are taking effect this year. SB360 imposes stiff penalties for the abuse, neglect, exploitation, isolation or abandonment of an older or vulnerable person by guardians who are supposed to protect them. Acts that result in bodily harm would be a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison. In AB130, the state tightens restrictions on the ability of guardians to dispose of or sell a ward's property and requires court approval to pay attorney fees from an estate.

That law also created the State Guardianship Compliance Office headed by an officer appointed by the Supreme Court.

That officer would have the ability to hire two accountants and two investigators to audit and investigate complaints and other abusive conduct. Authors of the law say there have been cases where guardians essentially emptied the bank accounts and other assets of the person they were charged with protecting.

The bill appropriates just under $1 million over the biennium to run the office.

AB249 and SB233 both mandate that public and private health plans cover access to contraception. Both, however, allow an organization an exemption based on religious beliefs. AB249 would require the state to pay the federal share of Medicaid family planning services and supplies.

In addition, SB122 provides for access to family planning services in the state. But the bill contains no funding, relying instead on gifts, grants and donations.

Similarly, SB91 establishes the HIV/AIDS and Cancer Drug Donation programs allowing people or governmental entities to donate to programs that provide drugs for those conditions. The bill specifically rejects the idea of donating medical marijuana.

SB201 prohibits health care professionals from providing sexual orientation, gender identity conversion therapy to minors. It states the Legislature declares there's a compelling need to protect children from, "harmful and destructive effects of conversion therapies."

SB194 prohibits the purchase, sale or possession with intent to sell any item made from shark fin, lion, elephant, rhinoceros, tiger, leopard, cheetah, jaguar, pangolin, sea turtle, ray, mammoth, narwhal, walrus or hippo.

SB361 expands protections for victims of domestic violence and enhances penalties including requiring a minimum two year prison term in cases involving strangulation by someone who has previously been convicted of felony domestic battery.

SB19 expands Carson City's highly successful dual enrollment program to the rest of the state. That program allows high school students to get dual credit for classes taken both at the high school and Western Nevada College.

AB482 creates the State Board for Career and Technical Education to oversee those programs statewide and grants the board the power to make state funds available for CTE programs.Skip to:

Newegg.com - Computer Parts, Laptops, Electronics, HDTVs, Digital Cameras and More!The anti-government protests targeting government and religious leaders sweeping across Iran took a bloody turn Sunday as overnight reports surfaces of two protestors being killed at the hands of the corrupt government. Disgustingly, the deaths didn't trigger much air on the three major American networks. ABC's Good Morning America had a blackout of the deaths and protests all together while NBC only found 24 seconds for them. CBS finally discovered the protests, as they continued into their fourth day, dedicating a meager 16 seconds.

Instead of allowing serious time for the brutal murders of Iranian civilians and the protests, whose marchers have been chanting "Death to Rouhani" and "We don't want an Islamic republic," NBC's Sunday Today ran a four minute and 37 seconds long highlight reel of the media slamming and smearing President Trump from this past year.

Fill-in host Hallie Jackson's news brief on the protests was pitiful and made it seem as though they were isolated to the country's capital city:

A semi-official news agency in Iran is reporting that two people have been killed in overnight protests there. These are the first deaths being attributed to the demonstrations which started Thursday. Thousands of people took to the streets of Teheran Saturday. Protesting the country's stagnant economy, alleged corruption and their government's involvement in conflicts in the region. President Trump on Twitter says the world is watching what happens there.

The ridiculousness of Jackson's brief could only be outdone by what could arguably be called a terrible joke by Jane Pauley on CBS News Sunday Morning. "Thousands of protesters have taken to streets in cities across Iran. At least two people were killed after some protests turned violent. It's the biggest display of dissent since pro-reform rallies in 2009," was all Pauley had to say after CBS had ignored the protests for three days.

These "reports," or lack thereof, from the major networks, were an absolute mess and did a tremendous disservice to the people literally putting their life on the line in Iran to protest their government. They made the deaths sound almost accidental when the Iranian government meant to kill them. What they failed to mention was the Iranian government's warning that protesters would "pay the price" for standing up and speaking out.

What else are the networks hiding from their viewers? The Iranian government had shut down parts of the internet, particularly social media sites, to curb the organization of dissenters. During the uprising in Doroud city, Iranian citizens stormed the local governor's office and set it ablaze. There, local security forces fired their weapons at them and hit five people. And all across the country protestors are tearing down images of Ayatollah Khamany.

And while all of the liberal networks previously fawned over an image from a Black Lives Matter protest showing a girl in a sundress being arrested by officers in full riot gear as some sort of profound statement, they callously omitted the viral video of an Iranian girl who took off her hijab in protest of the treatment of women in Iran to wave it like a white flag.

The big three networks have a very disturbing history in backing Iran over the United States. They almost never report when the Iranian Revolutionary Guard harasses our navy at sea and the ignored the sentencing of an American citizen there on trumped-up charges. When President Trump issued new sanctions on Iran, CBS sympathized with the rogue regime. NBC recently sat down with President Hassan Rouhani, the man many Iranians are now calling for the death of, and bemoaned the Trump's rhetoric with him. NBC also suggested Iran wasn't really a threat to the region and it was only a ploy by Trump.

8:12:15 AM Eastern HALLIE JACKSON: A semi-official news agency in Iran is reporting that two people have been killed in overnight protests there. These are the first deaths being attributed to the demonstrations which started Thursday. Thousands of people took to the streets of Teheran Saturday. Protesting the country's stagnant economy, alleged corruption and their government's involvement in conflicts in the region. President Trump on Twitter says the world is watching what happens there.

...Two protesters taking part in demonstrations roiling Iran were killed at a rally overnight, a semi-official news agency reported Sunday, the first deaths attributed to the ongoing protests.

President Donald Trump, meanwhile, dramatically upped his show of support for the economic protests in Tehran, saying the "entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change."

Trump tweeted Saturday that Iran's leaders fear their own people. He said "Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice." He added: "The world is watching!" Trump says that apart from U.S. military power, the Iranian people are what Tehran fears the most.

The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.... pic.twitter.com/W8rKN9B6RT — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2017

In the second tweet, Trump's comment to the UN that "oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice" was shown in a video clip and tweeted, followed by the warning that the "world is watching."

Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. The world is watching! pic.twitter.com/kvv1uAqcZ9 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2017

And on Sunday morning, he tweeted his support for the protesters again:

Big protests in Iran. The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. Looks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2017

Trump tweeted again amid his New Year's tweets later Sunday, slamming Iran for shutting down social media amid the protests:

Iran, the Number One State of Sponsored Terror with numerous violations of Human Rights occurring on an hourly basis, has now closed down the Internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. Not good! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2017

Anti-government protesters massed again on Sunday afternoon in defiance of a warning by the authorities of a tough crackdown, extending for a fourth day one of the most audacious challenges to the clerical leadership since pro-reform unrest in 2009.

Police in the centre of Tehran fired water cannon to try to disperse demonstrators, according to pictures on social media.

Video posted online also showed a clash between protesters and police in the city of Khoramdareh in Zanjan province in the country's northwest. Reuters was unable immediately to verify the authenticity of the footage.

There were also reports of demonstrations in the cities of Sanandaj and Kermanshah in western Iran as well as Chabahar in the southeast and Ilam and Izeh in the southwest.

Tens of thousands of people have protested across the country since Thursday against the Islamic Republic's unelected clerical elite and Iranian foreign policy in the region. They have also chanted slogans in support of political prisoners.

Demonstrators initially vented their anger over economic hardships and alleged corruption but they took on a rare political dimension, with a growing number of people calling on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down.

Giving his first public reaction to the protests, President Hassan Rouhani said Iranians had the right to protest and criticise the authorities.

But he warned, according to official media: "The government will show no tolerance for those who damage public properties, violate public order and create unrest in the society."

"People are absolutely free to criticise the government and protest but their protests should be in such a way as to improve the situation in the country and their life."

"Criticism is different from violence and and damaging public properties," he said.

The protests are the biggest since unrest in 2009 that followed the disputed re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Videos showed protesters in central Tehran chanting "Down with the dictator!", in an apparent reference to Khamenei.

Protesters in Khorramabad in western Iran shouted "Khamenei, shame on you, leave the country alone!".

The government said it would temporarily restrict access to the Telegram and Instagram messaging apps, state television quoted an informed source as saying.

An Iranian reached by telephone, who asked not to be named, said there was a heavy presence of police and security forces in the heart of the capital.

"I saw a few young men being arrested and put into police van. They don't let anyone assemble," he said.

In the northwestern city of Khoy, a video showed a protester being arrested by police while a crowd shouted "Police, go and arrest the thieves!". Video on social media showed people in the city of Dorud set fire to a bank building. The authenticity of the video, like others, could not immediately be verified.

Demonstrators also shouted: "Reza Shah, bless your soul." Such calls are evidence of a deep level of anger and break a taboo. The king ruled Iran from 1925 to 1941 and his Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown in a revolution in 1979 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic's first leader.

Demonstrators have denounced high prices, alleged corruption and mismanagement. Youth unemployment reached 28.8 percent this year.

Economic indexes have improved under Rouhani's government and the economy is no longer in dire straits. However, growth has been too slow for an overwhelmingly youthful population, far more interested in jobs and change than in the Islamist idealism and anti-Shah republicanism of the 1979 revolution.

The demonstrations are particularly troublesome for Rouhani's government because he was elected on a promise to guarantee rights to freedom of expression and assembly.

Rouhani's main achievement is a deal in 2015 with world powers that curbed Iran's nuclear program in return for a lifting of most international sanctions. But it is yet to bring the economic benefits the government promised.

Ali Asghar Naserbakht, deputy governor of Tehran province, was quoted as saying by ILNA news agency that 200 protesters had been arrested on Saturday.

Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi said some of the arrested protesters had confessed "they were carried away by emotions and set fire to mosques and public buildings", and said they would face heavy punishment.

"After giving thousands of martyrs for the Revolution, the nation will not return to dark era of Pahlavi rule," he said.

Police and Revolutionary Guards have in the past crushed unrest violently. These protests could be worry authorities more because they seem spontaneous and lack a clear leader.

And yet analysts say Iran's leaders believe they can count on support from many of the generation that took part as youths in the 1979 revolution because of their ideological commitment and the economic gains they have made under the government.

In apparent response to the protests, the government backed down on plans to raise fuel prices, promised to increase cash handouts to the poor and create more jobs in coming years.

"We predict that at least 830,000 jobs will be created in the new year," government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said on state television on Saturday night. He gave no details. Around 3.2 million Iranians are jobless.

Protesters also expressed anger over costly interventions in Syria and Iraq, where Iran is engaged in a proxy war for influence against regional rival Saudi Arabia.

Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said: "The Iranian government is being tested by its own citizens. We pray that freedom and human rights will carry the day."

Rouhani rebuffed Trump's comments, saying he had no right to sympathise with Iranians since he "called the Iranian nation terrorists a few months ago".

Trump refused in October to certify that Tehran is complying with its 2015 nuclear deal and said he might terminate the accord. British foreign minister Boris Johnson tweeted it was vital citizens have the right to demonstrate peacefully.

Protesters have attacked banks and government buildings and burned police vehicles. Two demonstrators were shot dead in the western town of Dorud on Saturday night. The deputy governor of Lorestan province blamed foreign agents for the deaths.I got Theresa May right

It's easy to forget now, but at the start of the year, there was a narrative around that Theresa May was a safe pair of hands who wouldn't do anything risky or politically dangerous.

"Far from being risk-averse, Theresa May is prone to a fight," I declared in January, adding, "in this case, she's merely suffered delay, rather than disaster."

I added: "It may be that far from being undone by caution, it will be her hotblooded streak that brings about the end of Theresa May". Which, given her decision to call an early election and her conduct of it – largely ran as a series of grudges against members of the Cabinet and the David Cameron approach rather than designed to win over any, actual, y'know, voters – held up pretty well.

...but I didn't expect her to call an early election

I predicted more times than I care to count that Theresa May wouldn't go to the country early unless she suffered some unexpected defeat that forced her hand. Even on the morning of the decision itself, I was predicting that she wouldn't do it.

In a way, the important thing was to predict that May is a politician prone to doing crazy shit that was, sooner or later, gonna come back to bite her, rather than to specifically identify in advance what the crazy shit would be. However, my rationale for why there wouldn't be an early election has aged particularly badly:

"An early election is in the gift of Parliament not the Prime Minister," I intoned less than a month before May announced her intention to go the country early, "She needs not just a majority vote but a two-thirds one for a dissolution. It may be that Theresa May has something up her sleeve to convince a) the DUP to vote to give up its position of influence over the government b) enough Conservative backbenchers to vote for irrelevance and c) enough Labour MPs to vote for electoral annihilation. But I'm at a loss as to what exactly that could be."

It turned out that the answer to this was simple: "ask for one". Hindsight is 20:20, but looking back, it is impossible to see how the main opposition party can ever refuse an election if the government wants one. The idea that Jeremy Corbyn could ever have said anything other than "Alright, come and have a go if you think you're hard enough" once May called for an early contest is obviously stupid now I think about it. And once Labour were on board, the two-thirds majority was locked in.

A useful lesson here is: if you can't articulate how a politician or party will defend a decision, then it won't happen. I'm not saying that the rationale has to be sensible, but it does need to exist.

I predicted that the election would not go well for Theresa May

An early election could "damage the PM's 'steady-as-she-goes' brand," I warned in March. "Although the polls are with her and the pattern from local and parliamentary by-elections suggests that she will be rewarded with a big majority, there is potential for disaster," I wrote the afternoon that Theresa May called the election.

"Theresa May will not have a good campaign by any objective standard," I declared shortly before the contest kicked off properly, "Her interviews will be halting, if she does come into contact with any actual voters they will go badly."

It was all going well. But then I added: "but it won't matter".

...but I didn't think it would matter

The biggest mistake I made during the election campaign was that my reading of elections past was that the campaign period didn't really matter all that much.

That coloured basically everything I got right in the election campaign: that Jeremy Corbyn was fighting a very good one, particularly for broadcast, that Theresa May was fighting a very bad one, because at every stage I allowed my belief that campaigns didn't really change very much to dictate my conclusions.

That lay behind my mistaken final conclusion: that Labour was surging, that the party was doing better, that Corbyn would emerge from the contest strengthened...but that first-past-the-post would mean that Labour would lose seats. Looking back, this was a terrible attempt to reconcile what I knew was happening with what I believed about election campaigns.

This is especially maddening as I wrote down a list of things I assumed about election campaigns partially so I could be aware of those biases.

It is true that it took several weeks of Labour doing almost everything right and the Conservatives doing almost everything wrong for the campaign to have an impact. I also think it's true that some Tory MPs are taking too much comfort in the ability of a campaign to turn things around, and are therefore more relaxed about what they see as May's mistakes than they should be. Nonetheless, while the circumstances of 2017 may not be repeated at the next election or indeed ever, in the future, I am going to try to be more alive to what I believe about a contest, and to think more about how that is influencing how I analyse what I know.I can think of only two times it's happened to me: I read a news story, or even a series of stories, and thought that it contained such extreme exaggerations that it had to be, essentially, false. I could enumerate my reasons, which were similar both times: the stories came from the Russian media, which is unreliable (even in the independent media outlets, reporting standards are often lax); the stories described awful, nearly unthinkable violence that came so neatly, so horrifyingly packaged, that it defied belief. I have known violence to be insidious, messy, trivialized by all participants, even as it happens, and these stories seemed to paint the exact opposite picture. These stories were preposterous—the word Hannah Arendt used in explaining why the world was so slow to understand the murderous threats posed by Hitler and Stalin.

The first story emerged in Russia about four years ago. Reports claimed that organized groups of young men were entrapping gay men, torturing them on camera, and posting the videos. I had a hard time believing that the effort was as well organized and widespread as the reports claimed. I have since learned that it was much more widespread than initially reported. Vigilante groups continue to entrap gay men in several Russian cities.

This spring, I didn't believe a story that claimed that authorities—no longer vigilantes but actual police—in Chechnya were rounding up and torturing gay men, and that some of these men had apparently been killed, while others were released to their relatives, who were instructed to kill the men themselves. I tried to latch onto the things that weren't true. There were rumors of special concentration camps for gay men—human-rights researchers said that this didn't check out. The original article in the muckraking Novaya Gazeta blamed the wave of arrests on a Moscow activist's effort to organize a Pride march somewhere in the North Caucasus. This was a classic case of blaming the victims, and also false. Yet the rest of the story was true.

I flew to Moscow in late May to report the story of the men who had been able to flee Chechnya, and at that time I still couldn't quite imagine the scale of the purges. I dropped my bag at a hotel and immediately headed to one of the safe houses. It had been difficult to get people to agree to talk with me, and I feared giving them time to change their minds. I spent the rest of the evening and half of the night talking to victims of the Chechen attacks, and went back again the next day, and the day after that. In my head, though, the stories began to run together after a couple of hours. This happens when you listen to accounts of extreme violence: bare suffering is a monotonous experience. I developed short-hand notations for the executioners' repertoire: electrocution, solitary-confinement cells, beatings, dunking in a vat of cold water, starvation.

Back in New York, I sorted through my notes on the men's personal tragedies. There was the guy whose name had been given up by someone he seemed to have loved—and who was now presumed dead. There was the man who had left his lover behind. And there were several men who were married to women, and had children they adored, who were struggling to figure out how to save their own lives and keep their families. There were several very young men who desperately missed their mothers but also knew that their families would probably kill them if they made contact.

They were all men. This was not because lesbians faced less danger in Chechnya but because they faced more. The men, at least, were free to leave the region on their own; women's lives were controlled entirely by their fathers, brothers, and husbands. The activists who were helping the men had sheltered one young woman, but, by the time I got to Moscow, she had disappeared. I learned bits of her story from recordings of two conversations with her on someone's phone. A few days later, she was dead, apparently killed by her family.

For security reasons, I couldn't write about the rescue effort in much detail, but I bet that, if I had read a story about it, I wouldn't have believed it. I could not have imagined that in Russia, where civil society has been trampled by the authorities with such force, queer people, who have been the government's scapegoat of choice for several years, would be able to pull off an effort as ingenious and sustained as the one I observed. By the end of the year, the Russian L.G.B.T. Network and the Moscow L.G.B.T. Community Center had succeeded in getting a hundred and six people out of Chechnya and then out of Russia altogether. A handful of people with no special training and very little funding at the start managed to save a hundred and six people from certain death.

Toward the end of the summer, my contacts in Moscow told me that they were wrapping up their effort. They thought that they were about to send the last of their charges out of the country. But then people kept coming.

So far, most of the men they have helped have gone to Canada. A few have landed in Latin America and in Europe. Many of them fear going to countries with large Chechen diasporas, where they are likely to be targeted again in exile. None of the men appear to have made it to the United States. In general, the U.S. has been one of the half-dozen countries that are reasonably likely to grant asylum to people persecuted on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity—a small subset of the very small number of countries that welcome asylum seekers at all. (Other countries in the select group that grant asylum to L.G.B.T. people include South Africa, Belgium, Argentina, the Netherlands, and Sweden). For now, L.G.B.T. asylum seekers are still faring well in the U.S., but the application process takes years, and, with the Trump Administration reshaping this country's immigration landscape, it's hard to imagine this country welcoming many Muslim gay men, even when they are fleeing mortal danger.The regular season comes to a close on Sunday. For 12 of the NFL's 32 teams, the journey will continue into January. Personnel from the other 20 teams will head off to the golf course/night club/comic convention/reality television series of their choosing. Treat yourselves, guys.

Sunday also marks the final opportunity for this year's top MVP candidates to make an impression on voters. Truth be told, we wish more of the top MVP hopefuls were actually, you know, playing in Week 17, but you can't control these things. At least you can bemoan them.

Here's how the MVP race looks from where we stand. Just a reminder: 2016 MVP Matt Ryan will place the diamond tiara atop the head of the 2017 winner at midnight of Super Bowl Eve. (That's not actually how it works, but you can't deny that would be a way more entertaining scenario.) Anyway, let's get to it.

THE FAVORITES

Why he'll win:

Historically, this is an award for the guy behind center. Recent trends suggest that won't change: Quarterbacks have won the MVP in nine of the last 10 years. This makes sense, considering quarterback is, by far, the game's most important position. Brady is the clubhouse leader for three reasons: 1) He's had another stellar season statistically 2) The Patriots are (still) the NFL's best team and 3) Several of Brady's greatest threats to the hardware have been knocked out of contention by injuries (more on that later). Don't discount the saucy narrative at play, either. Brady is doing all this at 40 years old, which is literally unprecedented. Peyton Manning, Brady's greatest rival, was a shell of his former self by his 39th birthday. An MVP vote for Brady is like landing an uppercut against Father Time -- and who wouldn't want to do that?

Why he won't:

Brady is the consensus pick for the greatest quarterback of all-time. If that's true, how can he only have two MVP awards in 18 seasons? It makes you wonder if voters find reasons not to vote for poor Tommy Boy. I'd guess it's probably less a far-ranging conspiracy and more the simple fact that voting Tom Brady as MVP is just, well, boring. If you're looking for a real reason to snub 12, you can fairly shine a light on some middling production of late. Over the past four weeks, Brady has thrown just four touchdown passes with five interceptions. His passer rating is a mundane 81.8 over that stretch, which includes a true primetime stinker against the Dolphins in Week 15 (and, to be fair, a game-winning drive to beat the Steelers the following Sunday). Shredding the Jets this weekend may be the final lift Brady needs for MVP No. 3.

Why he'll win:

The narrative that a running back can't win MVP unless records are crumbling at his feet is overblown. Yes, this is generally a QB award, but six running backs have claimed the trophy in the last 20 years. So let's not act like Gurley has no chance just because he didn't run for 2,000 yards like Adrian Peterson in 2012. Gurley actually compares quite favorably to All Day in '12 when you put their numbers side by side. Then there's this from our NFL Media Research Department: Gurley is the third player in NFL history with 2,000-plus scrimmage yards, 10-plus rushing touchdowns and six-plus rushing touchdowns in a season. Marshall Faulk and O.J. Simpson are the only other guys to do it. I mean, that's pretty historical, right? Faulk and the Juice both won MVP awards, by the way.

Why he won't:

No one will argue that Brady is the engine that makes the Patriots go on offense. You can probably say the same for Gurley and the Rams, but the remarkable turnaround in Los Angeles has many fathers -- Jared Goff and Sean McVay included. The Rams are on pace to become the first team in NFL history to go from last in scoring (14.0 in 2016) to first the following year (31.0 through Week 16). That is amazing, and it's the product of a near-perfect recalibration of the entire machine. Also not helping the MVP cause: Gurley won't play against the 49ers on Sunday, a shame considering the man has been on an absolute tear over the past month. One more week of obscene numbers might have been enough to give Gurley a slight edge of Brady. Instead, he'll stand where he is.

STRUCK DOWN BY THE GODS

If Wentz didn't blow out his knee, I believe there was a very strong chance he would have won this award going away. He was that good. And this was only his second season! All is not lost, denizens of Philadelphia.

How great was Brown before that blasted calf injury early in the Patriots Bowl? He'll end up missing essentially the final three games of the regular season and still has an excellent shot to lead the NFL in receiving (DeAndre Hopkins trails Brown by 155 yards entering Sunday). A healthy Brown could have sniffed 125 catches, 2,000 yards and 15 touchdowns -- video game production that would've warranted serious consideration regardless of the wide receiver bias of MVP voters. Alas.

STILL ALIVE WITH A WILDLY HISTORIC WEEK 17 PERFORMANCE

Wilson is ground zero in the "What does 'most valuable player' really mean, mannnnn?" debate that will rage until the sun burns out. No team in the NFL has leaned harder on a single player than the Seahawks have on their star quarterback. Seattle has asked Wilson to do everything this year, and he pretty much went, "OK."

I did some math (truth be told, I asked someone to do the math for me): @DangeRussWilson accounts for 87% of @Seahawks total yards (rushing + passing) and 97% of touchdowns - for love of ice cream, wowee. ��� Amy Trask (@AmyTrask) December 27, 2017

If this compromised Seahawks team finds a way into the playoffs this weekend, consider it one of Wilson's greatest career achievements. That said, his MVP candidacy officially died for us when the Rams went into Seattle in Week 15 and sucked out the soul of the perennial NFC West powerhouse. That's one of my (previously) unwritten rules: Once you lose soul ownership rights, you cannot win an Associated Press trophy.

Keenum won't land the tiara (there is no tiara), but how cool is it that his name has been surfaced at all in this conversation? Sports, man. Don't be stunned if a couple of voters get frisky and show the likable journeyman quarterback some love. Like I wrote earlier, narrative matters and Keenum is a great story. Maybe Keenum ends up being the Ross Perot of this MVP race: He won't seriously contend for the big chair, but he could shake up the establishment enough to swing the election.

FEATURESUpdate: Injured firefighter is a 10-year veteran

A firefighter was seriously injured in a blaze at a building in Newark's North Ward late Saturday, officials said.

The firefighter was hospitalized in critical condition, according to Newark Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose, who was at the hospital.

Emergency crews remained at the scene, near Park and Bloomfield avenues, shortly before 11 p.m. The blaze was not yet declared under control, a public safety department spokeswoman said late Saturday night.

The building that burned was listed online as Velez Tire and Auto Repair.

Wind chill values reached between zero and 5 degrees as crews worked at the scene.

The new firmware comes without any surprises and includes picture-in-picture mode, improved notifications, and more.

The Moto Z2 Force by Lenovo has been around since August when it arrived on the market with Android 7.1.1 Nougat onboard. In the meantime, this interesting modular smartphone received Android Oreo as well. However, not all carrier versions got the refresh at the same time. About a week ago, Verizon Wireless became the first US carrier to roll out the Oreo firmware to the Moto Z2 Force units on its network. Now, the time has come for T-Mobile to do the same.

According to the screenshots shared online by one of those who already got the update, the new firmware includes the security patch dated December 1, 2017. The list of changes includes the usual Oreo goodies, such as picture-in-picture mode or the ability to snooze notifications separately, not to mention the overall performance and autonomy improvements.

Although the competition in the high-end sector of the mobile market is fierce these days, the 5.5-inch Moto Z2 Force remains a flagship still worthy of attention, since it features a high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 4 GB or 6 GB RAM, and 64 GB or 128 GB internal storage, not to mention the dual camera setup on its back and the ability to improve its capabilities or add new ones thanks to the modules simply known as Moto Mods.Welcome to today's Nottingham Forest live blog.

What will you be drinking to celebrate the new year? We asked you to send us your weirdest cocktail recipes.

LAUREN FRAYER, HOST:

It's New Year's Eve, and we wanted to know, what will you be drinking to ring in 2018? We asked you to send us your strangest, your most unique, least usual cocktail recipes, and you obliged. Nicholas Hilborn (ph) sent us a recipe for a super fruity Belgian lambic beermosa (ph) as an alternative to a champagne mimosa. Jeffrey Smith (ph) suggested a Filipino invention - a beer-gin-Coke (ph). Yes, that's beer, gin and Coke. And Anthony Pusateri (ph) said he'd be drinking straight Malort because he says it tastes about as good as this year has been.

We decided to pick one especially odd cocktail to taste test from Juleep Rangul (ph) called a Red Mocho Kooler. And a little known fact is that WEEKEND EDITION executive producer Sarah Oliver used to be a bartender. So a bunch of us picked up some ingredients and wheeled out the trusty WEEKEND EDITION bar cart. It usually resides in regular host Lulu Garcia-Navarro's office.

She doesn't mind if we use this while she's gone, does she?

SARAH OLIVER, BYLINE: I don't think so. She'll never know.

(LAUGHTER)

FRAYER: And started our New Year's Eve celebrating a wee bit early.

All right.

OLIVER: All right.

FRAYER: Now, we didn't specify that our listeners send us good recipes, only weird ones. Sarah, I'll let you do the honors of explaining what's in a Red Mocho Kooler.

OLIVER: So this drink has Kalua, chocolate syrup and red Kool-Aid. OK? Yum.

FRAYER: (Laughter).

OLIVER: First, we start with the Kalua. She didn't specify how much to put in of each ingredient, but since it is the middle of the day, we'll just use the small jigger.

FRAYER: So we've got liquid, we've got syrup, and we've got powder.

OLIVER: All right, guys.

FRAYER: Resist the urge to stir.

OLIVER: Yeah.

FRAYER: Here goes.

OLIVER: Oh, my God.

FRAYER: Oh, oh, yeah.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: OK.

OLIVER: Yeah, she did say that it's disgusting.

FRAYER: So Sarah, our executive producer, used to be a bartender. Did you ever tend bar on New Year's Eve?

OLIVER: I did not tend bar on New Year's Eve. No, I was usually out at a bar on New Year's Eve. But I can tell you what I think makes a perfect New Year's Eve cocktail. And that is one, first of all, that you do not have every day; second of all is some sort of crazy color or texture - maybe we'll go with color rather than texture - and that has an impressive presentation. So I brought one for you today. And the secret ingredient...

FRAYER: Egg, oh, oh, my.

OLIVER: ...Is an egg. And what I am going to make for you is something my dad used to make very often on New Year's Eve. And it's called a Pink Lady. It's a very old-fashioned cocktail.

FRAYER: Wow, sounds glamorous.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yeah.

OLIVER: So it has the egg white.

FRAYER: OK.

OLIVER: It has a little bit of grenadine. It has some half and half, some gin.

FRAYER: So it's like a Shirley Temple with raw breakfast and gin.

OLIVER: And you add some...

FRAYER: All the food groups here.

OLIVER: ...Crushed ice to this one.

FRAYER: OK.

OLIVER: And this is probably one of my most vivid holiday memories from my dad, which is...

(SOUNDBITE OF COCKTAIL SHAKER)

OLIVER: And for this, you need to use a chilled glass.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Oh, it's beautiful.

FRAYER: Beautiful. It's like a fluorescent pink milkshake.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Oh, it looks like all my hopes and dreams for 2018.

(LAUGHTER)

OLIVER: All right, you guys drink up.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Thank you, Sarah.

FRAYER: That's Sarah Oliver, executive producer of WEEKEND EDITION, and our resident excellent mixologist.

OLIVER: Happy New Year.

FRAYER: Happy New Year.

OLIVER: Cheers.

The bash is supposed to span four floors and will ring in the New Year by dropping 50,000 balloons.In a photograph by Sara Hylton, a confident woman stands in profile for a portrait. Wearing a patterned shirtdress and gleaming brass jewelry, she exudes style. What is not immediately apparent is that the picture was shot in South Sudan, a young, war-torn country where even carrying a camera in public is dangerous.

In this moment, though, the conflict is quiet; commanding the frame is Akuja de Garang's self-possession, her unbroken spirit. What you see and what surrounds the subject are two seemingly contradictory stories, raising the question of how content and context inform each other."This is slave labor," said Agnes Jongerius, a Dutch member of the European Parliament, who has urged European authorities to force Poland to stop admitting North Korean workers.

Ms. Kowalska scoffed at allegations of abuse and said the North Koreans she managed enjoyed "a normal life."

"They asked us for advice on what to buy their wives and kids," she said. "They liked to buy lingerie for their wives. It was a popular gift, and they would ask us about inexpensive shops."

She said her company paid the workers about $780 per month. She acknowledged at first that Armex sent a portion of their wages to a North Korean company, but later said she had misspoken and no one took a cut.

As international scrutiny has intensified, the State Labor Inspectorate has vowed to investigate claims of abuse. So far, the agency has found "no signs of forced labor," said Dorota Gorajska, an official responsible for companies that employ foreign workers.

Officials acknowledged, however, that inspections have generally been confined to paperwork and that when interviews are conducted, investigators typically rely on translators provided by employers.

Given North Korea's reputation, does that not taint their findings? An official at the inspectorate, Michal Tyczynski, took a deep breath.

"It's a tricky question," he said. "There is no good answer to this question."Mr. Rouhani's failure to improve people's livelihoods has been further aggravated by recent price spikes in staples like eggs, coupled with the government's plans to sharply reduce subsidies that many Iranians are accustomed to receiving. So resentment toward the government over economic issues is not unexpected.

While the Iranian authorities appear to have been surprised by the spontaneity and speed of the demonstrations, outside analysts have little doubt that Ayatollah Khamenei and his subordinates would use force to suppress them if they felt it necessary. And there is little to suggest that the protesters have leaders or a cohesive message, like those in the 2009 uprising.

"The ongoing protests, by contrast, show no well-defined demands, no leadership or organization, and are diffuse around Iran," Cliff Kupchan, the chairman of the Eurasia Group, a Washington-based political risk consultancy, said in an advisory emailed to clients on Sunday.

But he also cautioned: "unrest is admittedly unpredictable — coming days could take unexpected turns. Signposts of a surprise include; a leader or small group of leaders emerging, a defined manifesto, and much larger protests."

Mr. Trump doubled down on his frequent criticism of the Iranian government on Sunday. He posted on Twitter: "The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. Looks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations!"

In an apparent response to Mr. Trump on Sunday, Mr. Rouhani said: "This man who today in America wants to sympathize with our people has forgotten that a few months ago he called the Iranian nation terrorist," according to PressTV. "This person who is against the Iranian nation from head to toe has no right to feel sorry for the people of Iran."

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he had talked to Mr. Trump on the phone on Sunday morning to urge him to be more forceful with the Iranian government. "It's not enough to watch," Mr. Graham said on CBS's "Face the Nation." "President Trump is tweeting very sympathetically to the Iranian people. But you just can't tweet here. You have to lay out a plan."I'm on vacation, keeping vague track of the news but basically taking a break and spending a lot of time communing with nature. But I've also been thinking a bit about economics, taking advantage of psychological distance to ruminate on stuff that isn't closely connected to the news. And one of the areas I've been chewing over goes back to my old stomping ground of economic geography.

In particular, I've been trying to clarify my thoughts after reading Emily Badger's stimulating piece on how megacities seem to have less and less need for smaller cities. I found myself asking what might seem like an odd question: what, in the modern economy, are small cities even for? What purpose do they serve? And this question leads me to a chain of thought that's a bit different from Badger's, although not necessarily contradictory.

Once upon a time, it was obvious what towns and small cities did: they served as central places serving a mainly rural population engaged in agriculture and other natural resource-based activities. The rural population was dispersed because arable land and other resources were dispersed, and so you had lots of small cities dotting the landscape.

Over time, however, agriculture has become ever less important as a share of the economy, and the rural population has correspondingly declined as a determinant of urban location. Nonetheless, many small cities survived and grew by becoming industrial centers, generally specialized in some cluster of industries held together by the Marshallian trinity of information exchange, specialized suppliers, and a pool of labor with specialized skills.Neymar tirou uma folga de 10 dias nesta época do ano e não perdeu tempo para viajar ao Brasil e passar as festas de final de ano e, principalmente, os jogos beneficentes que ele sempre participa.

Ao ser questionado sobre seus desejos para o próximo, Neymar contou:

"Sobre 2018, a única coisa mais importante na minha vida é conquistar a Copa de 2018. Eu sempre oro e peço a Deus para que nos coloque no caminho certo para que essa conquista venha".Identity politics has been nothing but a bane to modern day gaming. Everything is about identitarianism, so much so that all Western games these days have become bogged down with some sort of speech, quest, theme, or orientation around gender politics in some form, fashion or way. It's become so pervasive that some gamers have opted out of supporting some of their favorite franchises due to the overt politicization that have overtaken them, such as Mass Effect: Andromeda or Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus.

Well, the upcoming Catherine: Full Body is expected to release in Japan next winter, and a Western release is scheduled to arrive shortly thereafter for the PS4 and PS Vita. However, the game is already being labeled as "transphobic" by some, and some of the typical Social Justice Warriors are drumming up non-troversies on social media in order to tinder the flames of sociopolitical outrage that has done nothing but ruin video games for many a gamer in recent times.

So what's going on and where did it start? Well, it started with the trailer below.

The trailer plays on the concept of Vincent, the main character, sleeping with the new character, Rin.

SJW gaming journalists have immediately assumed that Rin has a penis, and therefore when Vincent saw that he actually slept with a man, he was shocked and appalled. This led to Kotaku's Laura Kate Dale complaining about it on Twitter, as chronicled by the Daily Dot, where Dale writes...

"They use a god damn trans symbol as the website icon for the official new site. All the key art is her lifting her dress to reveal her crotch. Gender neutral name. I don't see how people are reading this as "oh he's just shocked the same as every route in the game. "Further allussion to Rin being a trans woman with a penis, the teaser site for the game has a huge image of her lifting her dress, fading before you see the crotch. Everything here screams trans woman route." [sic]

The full image on the website does fade before you see Rin's genitals, otherwise if they did show the full thing the website would need an age gate and would likely be considered pornography.

Complaining about it on Twitter wasn't enough, however. Not-so-subtle jabs were taken at Atlus, with Dale claiming in the Kotaku article that the company has a "poor track record with trans representation". The most upvoted comment on the article takes jabs at Dale and questions the credibility of Kotaku's writers, since the comment claims that they likely never played the original Catherine.

Nevertheless, Polgyon took a similar angle to Kotaku, attempting to shame Atlus into improving "queer representation" in their games. Polygon's comment section reinforced the SJW mindset.

Attack of the Fanboy attempted to approach the situation as a moderate, but actually still fell on the side of wanting Atlus to essentially approach Catherine: Full Body in similar tone and fashion to what Kotaku and Polygon are asking for.

Many also pointed out that people on Twitter getting outraged at Vincent having a shocked face while looking at Rin's crotch isn't any different than Vincent's reaction to finding out he slept with the blonde-haired Catherine, as evidenced with the screenshot below.

Some gamers even took this opportunity to criticize Kotaku for attempting to create outrage bait based on a teaser trailer and Vincent's reaction, which was similar to how he reacted during the original Catherine.

No, Kotaku, this controversy is only engineered by your own writer. pic.twitter.com/f2OyWoARTF — (((R🎃r👻n_St☠️hl))) (@Roran_Stehl) December 22, 2017

But it wasn't just Polygon and Kotaku who tactically positioned themselves to pressure Atlus into adopting Social Justice Warrior antics for Catherine: Full Body. The Leftist media outlets mobilized their followers to also go after Atlus, attempting to use social media as a battleground to impose their ideological representation of gender politics and gender identity onto the upcoming Catherine: Full Body.

Sites like TheGG and Dangerous caught wind of the tweets, and shared a few, including one from an autistic CPTSD pansexual fictionkin.

Get a job at Atlus, then lobby for gay options and female protagonists in the Persona games. Also, add more female protagonists in general to MegaTen games. Also also, stop all the transphobia going on. — Momcubus (@FairlyLip) December 19, 2017

A UI designer and translator who happens to be Japanese, part of RPGSite and Nova Crystallis, and part of the LGBTQIA community, also implored gaming websites to reach out so that those representing the alternative lifestyle in Japan could have their voices elevated.

I would actually like to see gaming outlets speak or consult Japanese people who are part of the LGBT+ scene about this issue because watching people who are unfamiliar with this constantly gloss over the issue of representation of LGBT+ in popular Japanese media is exhausting. — kazuma (@MadAdam_) December 19, 2017

Atlus managed to weather the storm when the SJW media came after them for the localization of Persona 5, but the pressure, criticisms, and attacks from the Social Justice Warriors is becoming increasingly sodden with the weight of wailing voices. Unless anti-SJWs can counter the complaints, it may just be a matter of time before Atlus eventually caves in and begins altering their games to suit the sensibilities of SJWs.

If you feel compelled to do so, you can contact Atlus directly through their Japanese Twitter account, and let them know how much you support their creative ingenuity and originality, possibly in hopes of drowning out those who would attempt to use their social media clout to further dilute gaming into a battleground of gender identity politics and sociopolitical embitterment.On Dec. 22, 2017, the Friday before Christmas, the new helipad at Mar-a-Lago was used for only the second time. A private business helicopter with the corporate Trump logo landed and took off from there a few hours before President Trump's arrival in the area via Air Force One. The only other time the new helipad has been used was on April 8, 2017. In that instance it was also a private business helicopter with the corporate Trump logo that landed and took off.

Helicopter takeoff and landing in the town of Palm Beach is strictly regulated, as one might expect. Essentially, it is limited to only emergency helicopters such as Trauma Hawk.

So when President Trump moved to have the federal government build a helipad at Mar-a-Lago for him, he had to seek a waiver from normal town rules to allow for helicopter take off and landing. The issue was taken up at the Jan. 10, 2017, Town of Palm Beach Town Council meeting. Under the advisement of long-serving Town of Palm Beach legal counsel John "Skip" C. Randolph, the Town Council voted 5-0 to grant the waiver with the caveat that it only be for government, not personal or private sector, use. Specifically, it designated Mar-a-Lago for the "take-off and landing of helicopters pursuant to the provisions of Section 14-34 of the Town Code of Ordinances during the term(s) of office of the President-elect Donald J. Trump for business related to the Presidency only."

Given that both times the helipad has been used a private business helicopter with the corporate Trump logo landed and took off, it would seem to violate the waiver allowing "for business related to the Presidency only." This is not an issue of politics and has nothing to do with whether one does or does not agree with President Trump's policies. This is an issue of the rule of law and no one — not even the President of the United States and not even in Palm Beach — should or can be above it.Writing for Religion News Service, Jonathan Merritt makes a not-so-stunning observation that evangelical churches are lacking in three critical areas of diversity: sexuality, race, and gender.

Merritt's findings come from a project called Church Clarity, an organization that reports evangelical churches' stances (or lack thereof) on LGBT equality. (We posted about them a couple of months ago when they launched.) Their most significant report yet reveals troubling, yet unsurprising, data about America's 100 largest churches.

For starters, none of them are overtly LGBTQ-affirming:

None of [America's megachurches] have policies affirming same-sex people and relationships. This staggering statistic will doubtlessly provide firepower to conservative Christians who claim that LGBTQ+ affirmation is a slippery slope to liberalism and a congregation killer. And yet the data also provides progressives a counterargument. According to CC's analysis, a paltry 35% of these mega-churches have clear LGBTQ+ policies, and 54% actually hide their positions (e.g. sermons and blogposts) deep inside their websites. This seems to indicate that many non-affirming mega-churches are not as boldly opposed as one might assume, and some of these large congregations may be currently reconsidering their positions and policies.

For a community that prides itself on having ownership of The Truth, the lack of clarity about this is intriguing. If churches feel strongly about their stance on homosexuality, why not own it? The fact that it's deliberately hidden suggests that there's underlying shame about their beliefs.

Next, the report finds, the vast majority of megachurches (93%) are led by white pastors, and only one (literally one) is lead by a female pastor:

... despite the Christian calls to diversity, equality, and justice, America's mega-churches are still lagging in the race department. These churches may preach a Gospel of inclusion, but they disproportionately prefer white men for their top leadership positions. ... Female pastors are on the rise in America, but not so for the largest mega-churches. Only 1 of the 100 largest churches on Outreach's list cites a female pastor.

Even that female pastor, Merritt notes, shared the title of "co-pastor" with her husband.

These statistics are troubling (especially given that a historic Jesus was likely a brown-skinned man who respected women more than the average man did back in the first century). Either these church leaders are not reading their bibles, or — more likely than not — they are selectively interpreting Scripture based on narrow, prejudiced agendas, excluding a lot of potential members and leaders in the process.

When you hear all that, it makes a lot of sense why more than 80% of white evangelicals voted for both Donald Trump and Roy Moore. They won't ever call themselves racists or sexists or homophobes, but their actions make clear that they're perpetuating all of those problems.

Breaking News: The Suit is Back!





April 2005



"Suits make a corporate comeback," says the New York Times. Why does this sound familiar? Maybe because the suit was also back in February, September 2004, June 2004, March 2004, September 2003, November 2002, April 2002, and February 2002.



Why do the media keep running stories saying suits are back? Because PR firms tell them to. One of the most surprising things I discovered during my brief business career was the existence of the PR industry, lurking like a huge, quiet submarine beneath the news. Of the stories you read in traditional media that aren't about politics, crimes, or disasters, more than half probably come from PR firms.



I know because I spent years hunting such "press hits." Our startup spent its entire marketing budget on PR: at a time when we were assembling our own computers to save money, we were paying a PR firm $16,000 a month. And they were worth it. PR is the news equivalent of search engine optimization; instead of buying ads, which readers ignore, you get yourself inserted directly into the stories. [ 1 ]



Our PR firm was one of the best in the business. In 18 months, they got press hits in over 60 different publications. And we weren't the only ones they did great things for. In 1997 I got a call from another startup founder considering hiring them to promote his company. I told him they were PR gods, worth every penny of their outrageous fees. But I remember thinking his company's name was odd. Why call an auction site "eBay"?



Symbiosis



PR is not dishonest. Not quite. In fact, the reason the best PR firms are so effective is precisely that they aren't dishonest. They give reporters genuinely valuable information. A good PR firm won't bug reporters just because the client tells them to; they've worked hard to build their credibility with reporters, and they don't want to destroy it by feeding them mere propaganda.



If anyone is dishonest, it's the reporters. The main reason PR firms exist is that reporters are lazy. Or, to put it more nicely, overworked. Really they ought to be out there digging up stories for themselves. But it's so tempting to sit in their offices and let PR firms bring the stories to them. After all, they know good PR firms won't lie to them.



A good flatterer doesn't lie, but tells his victim selective truths (what a nice color your eyes are). Good PR firms use the same strategy: they give reporters stories that are true, but whose truth favors their clients.



For example, our PR firm often pitched stories about how the Web let small merchants compete with big ones. This was perfectly true. But the reason reporters ended up writing stories about this particular truth, rather than some other one, was that small merchants were our target market, and we were paying the piper.



Different publications vary greatly in their reliance on PR firms. At the bottom of the heap are the trade press, who make most of their money from advertising and would give the magazines away for free if advertisers would let them. [ 2 ] The average trade publication is a bunch of ads, glued together by just enough articles to make it look like a magazine. They're so desperate for "content" that some will print your press releases almost verbatim, if you take the trouble to write them to read like articles.



At the other extreme are publications like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. Their reporters do go out and find their own stories, at least some of the time. They'll listen to PR firms, but briefly and skeptically. We managed to get press hits in almost every publication we wanted, but we never managed to crack the print edition of the Times. [ 3 ]



The weak point of the top reporters is not laziness, but vanity. You don't pitch stories to them. You have to approach them as if you were a specimen under their all-seeing microscope, and make it seem as if the story you want them to run is something they thought of themselves.



Our greatest PR coup was a two-part one. We estimated, based on some fairly informal math, that there were about 5000 stores on the Web. We got one paper to print this number, which seemed neutral enough. But once this "fact" was out there in print, we could quote it to other publications, and claim that with 1000 users we had 20% of the online store market.



This was roughly true. We really did have the biggest share of the online store market, and 5000 was our best guess at its size. But the way the story appeared in the press sounded a lot more definite.



Reporters like definitive statements. For example, many of the stories about Jeremy Jaynes's conviction say that he was one of the 10 worst spammers. This "fact" originated in Spamhaus's ROKSO list, which I think even Spamhaus would admit is a rough guess at the top spammers. The first stories about Jaynes cited this source, but now it's simply repeated as if it were part of the indictment. [ 4 ]



All you can say with certainty about Jaynes is that he was a fairly big spammer. But reporters don't want to print vague stuff like "fairly big." They want statements with punch, like "top ten." And PR firms give them what they want. Wearing suits, we're told, will make us 3.6 percent more productive.



Buzz



Where the work of PR firms really does get deliberately misleading is in the generation of "buzz." They usually feed the same story to several different publications at once. And when readers see similar stories in multiple places, they think there is some important trend afoot. Which is exactly what they're supposed to think.



When Windows 95 was launched, people waited outside stores at midnight to buy the first copies. None of them would have been there without PR firms, who generated such a buzz in the news media that it became self-reinforcing, like a nuclear chain reaction.



I doubt PR firms realize it yet, but the Web makes it possible to track them at work. If you search for the obvious phrases, you turn up several efforts over the years to place stories about the return of the suit. For example, the Reuters article that got picked up by USA Today in September 2004. "The suit is back," it begins.



Trend articles like this are almost always the work of PR firms. Once you know how to read them, it's straightforward to figure out who the client is. With trend stories, PR firms usually line up one or more "experts" to talk about the industry generally. In this case we get three: the NPD Group, the creative director of GQ, and a research director at Smith Barney. [ 5 ] When you get to the end of the experts, look for the client. And bingo, there it is: The Men's Wearhouse.



Not surprising, considering The Men's Wearhouse was at that moment running ads saying "The Suit is Back." Talk about a successful press hit-- a wire service article whose first sentence is your own ad copy.



The secret to finding other press hits from a given pitch is to realize that they all started from the same document back at the PR firm. Search for a few key phrases and the names of the clients and the experts, and you'll turn up other variants of this story.



Casual fridays are out and dress codes are in writes Diane E. Lewis in The Boston Globe. In a remarkable coincidence, Ms. Lewis's industry contacts also include the creative director of GQ.



Ripped jeans and T-shirts are out, writes Mary Kathleen Flynn in US News & World Report. And she too knows the creative director of GQ.



Men's suits are back writes Nicole Ford in Sexbuzz.Com ("the ultimate men's entertainment magazine").



Dressing down loses appeal as men suit up at the office writes Tenisha Mercer of The Detroit News.



Now that so many news articles are online, I suspect you could find a similar pattern for most trend stories placed by PR firms. I propose we call this new sport "PR diving," and I'm sure there are far more striking examples out there than this clump of five stories.



Online



After spending years chasing them, it's now second nature to me to recognize press hits for what they are. But before we hired a PR firm I had no idea where articles in the mainstream media came from. I could tell a lot of them were crap, but I didn't realize why.



Remember the exercises in critical reading you did in school, where you had to look at a piece of writing and step back and ask whether the author was telling the whole truth? If you really want to be a critical reader, it turns out you have to step back one step further, and ask not just whether the author is telling the truth, but why he's writing about this subject at all.



Online, the answer tends to be a lot simpler. Most people who publish online write what they write for the simple reason that they want to. You can't see the fingerprints of PR firms all over the articles, as you can in so many print publications-- which is one of the reasons, though they may not consciously realize it, that readers trust bloggers more than Business Week.



I was talking recently to a friend who works for a big newspaper. He thought the print media were in serious trouble, and that they were still mostly in denial about it. "They think the decline is cyclic," he said. "Actually it's structural."



In other words, the readers are leaving, and they're not coming back.



Why? I think the main reason is that the writing online is more honest. Imagine how incongruous the New York Times article about suits would sound if you read it in a blog: The urge to look corporate-- sleek, commanding, prudent, yet with just a touch of hubris on your well-cut sleeve-- is an unexpected development in a time of business disgrace. The problem with this article is not just that it originated in a PR firm. The whole tone is bogus. This is the tone of someone writing down to their audience.



Whatever its flaws, the writing you find online is authentic. It's not mystery meat cooked up out of scraps of pitch letters and press releases, and pressed into molds of zippy journalese. It's people writing what they think.



I didn't realize, till there was an alternative, just how artificial most of the writing in the mainstream media was. I'm not saying I used to believe what I read in Time and Newsweek. Since high school, at least, I've thought of magazines like that more as guides to what ordinary people were being told to think than as sources of information. But I didn't realize till the last few years that writing for publication didn't have to mean writing that way. I didn't realize you could write as candidly and informally as you would if you were writing to a friend.



Readers aren't the only ones who've noticed the change. The PR industry has too. A hilarious article on the site of the PR Society of America gets to the heart of the matter: Bloggers are sensitive about becoming mouthpieces for other organizations and companies, which is the reason they began blogging in the first place. PR people fear bloggers for the same reason readers like them. And that means there may be a struggle ahead. As this new kind of writing draws readers away from traditional media, we should be prepared for whatever PR mutates into to compensate. When I think how hard PR firms work to score press hits in the traditional media, I can't imagine they'll work any less hard to feed stories to bloggers, if they can figure out how.







Notes



[ 1 ] PR has at least one beneficial feature: it favors small companies. If PR didn't work, the only alternative would be to advertise, and only big companies can afford that.



[ 2 ] Advertisers pay less for ads in free publications, because they assume readers ignore something they get for free. This is why so many trade publications nominally have a cover price and yet give away free subscriptions with such abandon.



[ 3 ] Different sections of the Times vary so much in their standards that they're practically different papers. Whoever fed the style section reporter this story about suits coming back would have been sent packing by the regular news reporters.



[ 4 ] The most striking example I know of this type is the "fact" that the Internet worm of 1988 infected 6000 computers. I was there when it was cooked up, and this was the recipe: someone guessed that there were about 60,000 computers attached to the Internet, and that the worm might have infected ten percent of them.



Actually no one knows how many computers the worm infected, because the remedy was to reboot them, and this destroyed all traces. But people like numbers. And so this one is now replicated all over the Internet, like a little worm of its own.



[ 5 ] Not all were necessarily supplied by the PR firm. Reporters sometimes call a few additional sources on their own, like someone adding a few fresh vegetables to a can of soup.



Thanks to Ingrid Basset, Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, and Aaron Swartz (who also found the PRSA article) for reading drafts of this.



Correction: Earlier versions used a recent Business Week article mentioning del.icio.us as an example of a press hit, but Joshua Schachter tells me it was spontaneous.



Former Super Bowl-winning head coach Jon Gruden may be planning on returning to coaching in the near future, but he isn't coming back to the Buccaneers.

That became clear when veteran Tampa Bay Times beat writer Rick Stroud broke the news that Dirk Koetter had received assurances from the Glazers that he would be back in 2018.

I'll be honest. My first reaction was that I'd heard this all before.

The Glazers assured Gruden that he would return in 2009 before firing him two weeks after the 2008 season. And in 2013, both former general manager Mark Dominik and former head coach Greg Schiano were told they would return prior to the season finale before being fired after losing at New Orleans, 42-17.

But I knew Stroud's reporting was correct because I the latest information I received on Thursday pointed to Koetter's return. That's why I wrote about the likelihood of Koetter seeing a third season as Tampa Bay's head coach at 9:15 a.m. ET in my latest SR's Fab 5 column – Koetter or Gruden? – over six hours before Stroud got confirmation and broke the story.

Here is what I wrote Friday morning:

Because of how hard the team has played and the amount of injuries the team has sustained, it is not a foregone conclusion that Koetter will be fired after Sunday's game.

Unless the Glazers want to pursue former head coach Jon Gruden, offer him the job and he accepts, I don't necessarily believe Koetter may be fired.

I don't see a clear-cut upgrade out there aside from Gruden, and perhaps the Glazers don't either.

Gruden may be putting feelers out there that he wants to coach again, and that his preference would be the Buccaneers, but would he actually pull the trigger and come back to the sidelines after nine years? We'll have to wait and see. We'll find out by next week.

And would the Glazers want Gruden back? Despite the victories he produced, Gruden wasn't the easiest coach to work with the first time around with high-profile spats with former general manager Rich McKay and wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. Perhaps they feel Gruden belongs in the Bucs Ring of Honor at the stadium rather than on the sidelines.

Or perhaps the Glazers know that bringing Koetter back after a disappointing 4-12 or 5-11 season would be a very tough sell to the fan base in the offseason and that Raymond James Stadium certainly wouldn't be more full in 2018 as a result. Heck, even the Stick Carriers are off the Koetter bandwagon.

Gruden's return would electrify the fan base and likely raise the level of play among the Buccaneers players, too. He's a master motivator and I have little doubt that he could take the Bucs to the next level. I'm not sure Koetter can.

But if Gruden doesn't come back to coach in Tampa Bay either because he wasn't asked, or he said no, then prepare for Year 3 of the Koetter regime.

So what happened?

Was PewterReport.com's reporting faulty all along? No.

Before the Bucs' playoff game in Philadelphia in 2001, Stroud broke the story that Tony Dungy would be fired and replaced by Bill Parcells. Dungy was fired, and the Glazers had discussions about Parcells replacing him, but it didn't happen. Something changed.

As it turns out, Parcells was advised at the last minute that the Bucs' salary cap situation was a mess, which it was, and that he would literally have a year or two to win a Super Bowl before the team had to purge some aging, high-paid stars. Parcells ended up turning down the Bucs after Dungy was fired, but that didn't mean what Stroud wrote was wrong just because Parcells ultimately didn't replace Dungy. It's just that things changed.

Here's what I do know. There were discussions between the Bucs and Gruden's representatives during the 2017 season to gauge interest in a possible return as Tampa Bay's head coach. PewterReport.com knew that and reported the interest and I discussed his possible return in several SR's Fab 5 columns and 2-Point Conversion columns.

NFL Network's Mike Silver, who has good connections with the Raiders organization, reported on Sunday that "the Bucs made an unsuccessful run at Gruden."

One reason I am not reporting that it's a done deal is... wait for it... the fact that it's not a done deal. I am adding a report that the Bucs made an unsuccessful run at Gruden. I think we all know what likely happens next. https://t.co/Klwi4h0fhe — Michael Silver (@MikeSilver) December 31, 2017

That contradicts what Stroud reported last night on Twitter, that he was told by Bucs officials and Gruden representatives that discussions did not take place about a possible return. I believe that's what Stroud was told, and that's what he reported in good faith. And it's obvious why he was told that – because Koetter is staying on as head coach and the Glazers don't want it to be made public that they were considering replacing him with Gruden.

Yet I know for a fact that there was interest on both sides and some discussions, but ultimately it was not going to happen for several reasons.

The first is over value. A few weeks ago I'd gotten wind of Gruden's potential contract demands, which are rumored to be $10 million per year over 10 years – fully guaranteed. Gruden makes $6.5 million annually from ESPN and another $2 million per year from endorsements. So it would take more than $8.5 million for Gruden to maintain his current value in the NFL. But I don't think this is necessarily about money to Gruden.

I think the desire for the 10-year guarantee is because of what happened to him during his final coaching stops in Oakland and Tampa Bay. First, he never got to finish the job of taking the Raiders to the Super Bowl as he was traded in the middle of the night because former owner Al Davis didn't want to give him the lucrative contract extension he was seeking following the 2001 season.

A 10-year, guaranteed contract literally buys the time Gruden – or any head coach – would want to build a program and sustain it in a league where the patience of owners and fans is short, and there are at least five head coaching vacancies every year.

The second reason is trust. In Tampa Bay, Gruden got fired after he became the franchise's all-time winningest coach in 2008 during a 9-7 season, and that came on the heels of signing a five-year contract extension with the Bucs in the same year. Gruden felt like his firing, which came out of the blue on January 19, was totally unjustified, and if he was going to return to the Bucs he would want a contract that would make him virtually unfireable for a decade.

The Glazers fired him once before, and after seeing them roll through four coaches in nine years since his departure I don't think Gruden fully trusted the Glazers. He and the Glazers have mended fences over the years, but I believe Gruden still carries a grudge over being fired. That's obvious every time Gruden puts on an FFCA (Fired Football Coaches Association) visor or shirt. A mammoth, long-term, guaranteed contract would be the only way to buy the Glazers' trust and commitment.

I don't think there is any way the Glazers would make a $100 million commitment to Gruden, if that indeed was his contract demand, and I don't blame them for it. There is no guarantee that Gruden's second voyage with the Buccaneers would be as successful as it was the first time with three NFC South division titles and a Super Bowl.

Raiders owner Mark Davis, who is Al Davis' son, is very close with Gruden and made overtures about him returning to Oakland twice since Gruden has been with ESPN and out of coaching. To this day, the long-time members of the Raiders organization are still upset with losing Super Bowl XXXVII to the Buccaneers with their former head coach. If Gruden is going to come back to the NFL, I'm guessing that Davis is thinking it's going to be as a Raider – not a Buccaneer.

If the reports about Davis' contract offer aligning with Gruden's desires are true, and that he's upping the ante by offering Gruden a stake in the team's ownership, that might be too good to turn down. Oakland is the franchise that gave Gruden his first shot at becoming a head coach and his deep, emotional roots to the Raiders rival those that he has for the Buccaneers.

I'm guessing the Glazers would never want to surrender part of their ownership to Gruden or anyone else, so I can't blame them for not getting in a bidding war with Davis and the Raiders.

Oakland also has a young, talented quarterback in Derek Carr that Gruden could work with, just as the Bucs did with quarterback Jameis Winston, so there is plenty of appeal. With the Raiders moving to Las Vegas in two years, Davis needs star power to sell to the Las Vegas community to fill the stadium and attract corporate sponsors. With such a huge financial commitment to uproot the Raiders to Las Vegas, it only makes sense that Davis would make a similarly huge financial commitment to bring Gruden back as the head coach.

The third reason that Gruden won't be coming back to Tampa Bay is an educated guess on my part. I've heard from several sources that Gruden is concerned about his legacy being tarnished if he were to come back to the Buccaneers. It's one thing to go back to Oakland and never take the Raiders to the Super Bowl because Gruden didn't do that in the first place – although he came close twice.

It's another thing to come back to the Buccaneers and try to live up to winning a Super Bowl in 2002. Gruden had six more years to win another one in Tampa Bay and ultimately couldn't win another playoff game despite attempts to do so at home in 2005 and 2007. The Super Bowl would always be the measuring stick for success in Tampa Bay, and despite that being the goal of all 32 NFL head coaches each year, that's a daunting task when a guy has done it before in a city and will expected to do so again after being out of coaching for nine years.

Gruden was inducted into the Bucs Ring of Honor this year and perhaps that's how his story was meant to end in Tampa Bay. Gruden will always be remembered as the first and only Super Bowl-winning head coach by fans. And that could be the way he wants it, rather than as the coach who came back and wasn't as successful the second time around like Joe Gibbs was in Washington when he came back from 2004-07. Additionally, Gruden will remember his own time in Tampa Bay as one that ended prematurely in 2008. He may not want to go down that road again without any guarantees.

As I wrote in Friday's SR's Fab 5, it was going to be Gruden or Koetter in Tampa Bay in 2018 because of the lack of quality head coaching candidates. Presently there is no clear-cut improvement over Koetter available.

Because the Glazers were unwilling to meet Gruden's demands, Gruden essentially made up the Glazers' minds for them. They're keeping Koetter.

Out of respect to Koetter, the Glazers will deny that they had any interest in bringing Gruden back, and that's understandable because they they have already announced that Koetter will return next season as the Buccaneers head coach. But I will stand firm in my reporting on PewterReport.com based on the information I have gathered over the last three months. I wouldn't have written half of what was reported on PewterReport.com if I didn't have good intel.

In the end, Koetter's feelings might be hurt if he believes there was interest in the Bucs replacing him with Gruden, but he just needs to put that aside and focus on winning more games in 2018 or he will be replaced.MANILA, Philippines — The invitation to become the country's third telecommunication player is open to all interested parties and not just to China Telecom, Malacañang clarified Sunday.

Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said the government would choose the best offer to make sure that consumers could benefit from competition.

"This is not limited to China. This is open to all telcos or investors around the world. Whoever can provide the best offer, the most viable offer, the most juicy offer will be the third player of the telecommunication industry of the Philippines," Andanar told radio station dzBB.

On December 10, Andanar himself announced in a radio interview that China Telecom would enter the Philippine telecommunication sector.

"The Chinese government has selected a company that will invest in the telco (industry) of our country. It is China Telecom, the largest telecommunications company in China ," he said then.

He also said that the government "is fast-tracking this because our countrymen are already irritated by dropped calls and slow internet."

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the next day that "it was a political decision of the President to offer it to a Chinese company."

The move, he said, was "to strengthen our bilateral ties with China, coupled with the fact that given the huge telecoms market in China, Chinese companies ought to have already technical know-how in providing competent and reliable telecom services."

Last November, Duterte invited China to invest in the telco industry to enhance the internet service in the country, which has been criticized for being slow and expensive.

Companies from Japan, South Korea, United States, and Australia have also expressed interest to form partnerships with local firms and become the country's third telco player, according to the Department of Information and Communications Technology.

Overseas firms need to forge partnerships with local firms because the Constitution limits foreign ownership of a public utility to 40 percent.

Duterte has ordered agencies to ensure that the third telco would be be able to operate within the first quarter.

He has also warned the judiciary against issuing temporary restraining orders that would hamper the entry of the third telco player.

"At the end of the day, what is important really is that we have a very good telecom industry, a very competitive one that can give good service to the people," Andanar said.ウェブブラウザのJavaScript(ジャバスクリプト)の設定が無効になっています。

Alcohol became my escape. Any chance I got to have a drink, I'd take it. At one stage, to be honest, I didn't know if I'd be able to stop.

Not many people actually knew how bad it was. A few who were close to me did and I had a couple of good mates down here from Albury who looked after me really well, because I was not in a good place. Thankfully they did, because I might not have been here if things hadn't changed.

Playing suburban footy that season helped me a lot – just getting a good group of people around me who didn't care about me being a tennis player. I was just another guy, one in a group of mates, and then at the end of that year I met Britt, my fiancée.

Getting my life sorted out helped me with my tennis, then tennis helped set me up for the rest of my life. But I needed to find myself before I was able to become a better tennis player. Tennis was a huge part of me even when I quit, and if I'd walked away and never come back, it would have been something I really regretted.

I'm lucky that during that time I did meet Britt and turned the personal side of my life around first. Tennis is a very tough, lonely sport, and even though I was married through the first part of my career it wasn't really the best personal set-up. In 2011, the fact that I didn't have either a private or professional life that was really steady brought everything undone.

And in 2015, when I was flying on court, who knows if I hadn't had that other side of my life going well whether I would have spiralled out again and had another crash? But the fact that I had Britt and I had a really good personal set-up made it easier to get through the downturn after 2015.

It also helped me come to this decision to retire, to walk away and feel happy about it.

'YOU'VE JUST LOST'

I don't know how I'll feel when I walk out for my last Australian Open, but I hope it's better than the last time I was playing singles. The last month, in the US, I felt sick just walking on to play matches.

I'd struggled for the past year-and-a-half, since I had my foot problem, and I wasn't really enjoying it. I was sort of just hanging on.

I made a throwaway comment to my coach Billy Heiser after I lost in qualifying at the US Open that, 'If I'm gonna keep playing like this, then what's the point?' And at the time, he said, 'Well, you've just lost.'

Then after I didn't get to the Davis Cup semi in Belgium, I came home to Australia, and because Davis Cup has been such a big thing for me over the last three or four years I was hoping we could get to a final and I could be a part of that. But suddenly that possibility was at least 12 months away.

And normally when I'm home in Melbourne for two weeks I'm really ready to go again, I get a bit stir-crazy, but in my head all I could think of was how could I find a way to a stay home a little bit longer?

I've never been like that. As a tennis player you get used to that lifestyle, but I really didn't want to go.

Getting my life sorted out helped me with my tennis, then tennis has helped set me up for the rest of my life. But I needed to find myself before I was able to become a better tennis player.

I didn't say anything to anyone at the time, I didn't even really say anything to Britt. She knew I'd been struggling with my tennis but she didn't know I'd been thinking about this.

She thought, like a lot of people probably did, that when I called time on singles I would at least go out and give doubles a go, because I've had pretty consistent doubles results over a long period for someone who's not really focusing on that side of things.

So I got to California and after I lost my first match, I went out and had a couple of drinks with a few of the guys on a yacht in the bay in San Francisco. It was really nice, and I woke up the next morning and said to Britt, 'I'm retiring.'

She said, 'What?' I said, 'Yeah, I've had enough, I don't want to do this anymore.'

I didn't announce anything but a lot of people close to me knew that was pretty much it. I was trying to push through those few weeks and I was still meant to go to Japan at the end of the year, I was in Vegas for my 30th birthday and I just wanted to get on a plane and come home. It all unfolded very, very quickly.

I'm playing singles qualies at the Australian Open. A wildcard would obviously be very nice, but I never expected one. I never have in my whole career.

I'm doing everything I can to be fit and ready for January. I've still trained through this whole period, and if I get a wildcard, fantastic, that's a bonus. If not, I'm ready to go out there and play qualies. I'll be out there in doubles, I'll be playing mixed, I'm still going to be part of the Australian Open.

What I'll miss most

I've had to start thinking, 'What do I actually do next?'

That's very much an unknown for me. I haven't got things locked down, no stuff guaranteed, so it will feel weird whenever that last match finishes in January to still wake up at 7am but not have my days filled with hours of training.

Obviously, Lleyton Hewitt stepped straight into the Davis Cup role when he retired, and I've talked to him and a lot of other people about what it's like when you actually step away.

I'm 30 years old, it's not like 65 or 70. There's a long time left in my life, so I've got to find something, or a number of things, that can keep me going.

As well as the camaraderie, I know I'll miss the competition. That will probably be the hardest thing. If I go into the media, for example, which is something that I've looked at doing for quite a while, I don't think the competitive side of my personality is ever going to go away, so I've got to find other ways to fill that void.

It's going to take some time to work out what the next stage looks like. I don't want to just rush into something that doesn't excite me. I've given everything I had to tennis; I have no doubt that whatever I decide to do I'm going to give 100 per cent to.

Coaching at the elite level would mean returning to that lonely lifestyle, and I don't feel coaching younger kids would be the best fit for me at the moment. I was never the most talented guy.

Yes, I had a fast serve, but I had to work really hard to get to where I did. So I feel like I can help some of the other Aussie guys make the transition to that top level, but do I want to be on the road for 30 weeks a year? At this stage, definitely not.

A guy like Lleyton got the most out of himself and got to No.1. I got the most out of myself and I got to No.53 in the world and I'm also extremely happy with that.

I felt I was probably on the way to going a little bit higher if I hadn't got injured, but at the same time if you'd told me in 2011 I would have been 53 in the world, I would have taken that in a heartbeat.

Team lleyton

I hit balls with Lleyton almost every day and we had a lot of discussions about me stopping. We played a lot of big matches together and he's a really good mate of mine, too.

I said to him that I wanted to play doubles with an Aussie in my last Aussie Open, but obviously a lot of the partnerships were already set.

So in trying to find the best possible option while also making my last one something special, we half threw the idea of playing doubles together out there as a joke.

Lleyton laughed and said, 'Well, I'm not the worst option, am I?' But obviously as Davis Cup captain, he's involved in all these wildcard decisions, so we had to run it by a lot of people. From a tournament's point of view, though, it's always great to have Lleyton Hewitt in the draw and on the schedule.

Singles-wise, I can play relaxed. It's not about my ranking or anything like that.

The finish line is getting closer. Going into it, I think I'll feel all right. Coming out of it all? Maybe I'll have a big run in singles, or doubles or mixed, where I'm playing with Sam Stosur again. How I'm going to feel at the end of it is probably the biggest unknown.

Stuffing cash in shoes

Tennis is two separate worlds. If you're playing the ATP 500 event in Washington, for example, you're staying at the nicest hotel, where the player party in the rooftop bar looks out over the White House gardens, and it all seems so great.

Then you end up in a hotel in Uzbekistan where the water doesn't get to the third floor. And for guys who float on the cusp of the top echelon, from 60 to outside 100, 200, it literally does change week to week.

As well as the camaraderie, I know I'll miss the competition. That will probably be the hardest thing.

Tennis is a strange world and it's hard to explain that to people. It looks very glamorous and I don't take it for granted that I've travelled the world and I've seen all these unbelievable places and I've had the chance to live in London and live in the States.

But at the same time it's pretty lonely. It's not always what it seems.

I remember being in Uzbekistan back in the day where some tournaments still used to pay their prizemoney in cash. When you arrived in the country, you had to declare on your customs form how much money you were bringing in, and I only found out the night before I left that you can't take more money out of Uzbekistan than you take in.

One year I made about $3000 by making a Challenger final there, but I'd declared that I'd brought in $800 in cash, so I remember sitting in my hotel room and wrapping $100 notes under the grips on my racquets so it wouldn't be confiscated.

Other guys put money under the insoles of their shoes. Obviously when you're playing at Challenger level and you have a good week that's very valuable money.

DARk side of social media

Playing Davis Cup had been a lifelong dream, and I made my debut in Perth in 2014. But winning the 2015 quarter-final from 0-2 down against Kazakhstan in Darwin was incredible.

The doubles, with Lleyton, was the first time I'd won a live rubber, and to win the first reverse singles against Mikhail Kukushkin, who's a very established Davis Cup player, was pretty special.

Then to go to from such a massive high to the semi-final against Britain in Glasgow and lose to the Murrays over five sets in a match that, if we'd won, we would have probably put ourselves into a Davis Cup final was probably one of the hardest losses I ever took.

Davis Cup has been unbelievable, and so was the chance to go to the Olympics. It's something greater than tennis. No one can ever take away from me the fact that I'm an Olympian.

And from a personal point of view, there's been so many highlights: making the third round at Wimbledon and having the chance to step out on centre court against Roger Federer; playing Roger again on Arthur Ashe Stadium at the US Open; and playing on Rod Laver Arena against Andy Murray.

For a kid who came from the bush and then in 2011 walked away from the sport and probably at that time was never gonna come back, to be able to play against some of the greatest players of all time on some of the biggest courts in the world is something that I'll be able to one day tell my kids about.

What I won't miss are the haters on social media.

It's the world we live in now, everyone wants information and social media's a big part of everything we do. It's how you build your fan base and how you market yourself to companies and build your brand commercially, but at the same time there's some pretty ordinary stuff out there.

I've copped any number of death threats against me and my family from people who wish bad things, and it's not a nice thing to have to go through.

You can say you don't read it, but at some stage when you're feeling a bit down – which happens, you don't win every week – and you pick up your phone and you're reading this stuff, sometimes it's not easy. I've done it.

You start writing back occasionally and then you pull your head in, and realise that these people are pretty insignificant in the scheme of things.

Tomic's big question

Australian tennis is in an interesting place. We have some unbelievably talented guys, but it's hard to know how everything will pan out. A guy like Nick Kyrgios, for example, he's Nick. He does what he does.

Nick could come out in 2018 and all of a sudden grow up a little bit and be top five. The guy could be No.1 in the world. Or he could continue to do some of the things that he seems fine with and pretty comfortable doing – and good on him for that because he's being him. He could sit at 20 in the world and do that pretty easily for a long period of time.

We're building a really good culture around Davis Cup. We say it a lot and I'm not sure how seriously people take what we say, but it's a great group to be part of, and unfortunately for Bernie Tomic, for example, he's taken himself out of that support network and I think it has affected him.

In a period where he's struggling with some things, I feel like the group could have helped him work through it.

Nick seems really happy right now, and there are times when he hasn't, but he's got that support around him with all the guys. We all speak and message each other and it just helps. The tour really is a lonely place, and to have a group of guys who are there, win or lose, all the time, is so helpful and important. It's great that Nick's embraced that, and sad that Bernie hasn't.

It's a great group to be part of, and unfortunately for Bernie Tomic, for example, he's taken himself out of that support network and I think it has affected him.

Bernie's been as high as 17th in the world, so there's no doubt that he can play tennis. A little bit like I had to work through Sam Groth finding out who Sam Groth was, Bernie has to do that because Bernie's only known himself as Bernie the tennis player.

Maybe, first of all, Bernie has to find out who Bernie actually is.

I think Nick will find his path. He's slowly doing it. We all know that the media loves to jump on and make a story out of everything, and Nick's a sensitive guy who reads everything written about him.

Maybe he needs to be a little more more water-off-a-duck's back about it all, but he's still young. Not too many people have found themselves at 21 or 22 years old. I'm still finding myself at 30, so Nick's still got some time to work out who Nick is, as well.

Tattoos & meaning

I'd like to be remembered as someone who got the maximum out of himself. I'm a proud and passionate Australian and every time I played for my country, I left everything out there. I don't think I've ever played a match where I haven't given 100 per cent.

Would I do anything differently if I had my time again? I probably wouldn't get married at 21, but that all shaped me to become the person I am, and if I hadn't done that and had those life lessons maybe I wouldn't have got to where I have.

Everyone always looks back, and hindsight's a nice thing, but I'm pretty happy with where I'm at and the person I am and the career I've had and the life I've built and the life I'm building. So, no, I don't think I'd change too much.

For a kid who came from the bush and then in 2011 walked away from the sport and probably at that time was never gonna come back, to be able to play against some of the greatest players of all time on some of the biggest courts in the world is something that I'll be able to one day tell my kids about.

The tattoo on my right arm says, 'Damned is the man who abandons himself'. I got that when I was working my way back in 2013 or 2014 and I was still outside the top 100.

It's significant to me because you're going to have doubters and haters and people who give up on you along the way, but you can never give up on yourself. I'm proud that I didn't, because there was a time when I was close.

But I bounced back. I'm in a good place now. To know that I won't have tennis but I've got all these other really great things in my life is an amazing thing.× About the Podcast

Follow him @joshuamzeitz.

As his first year in the White House draws to a close, Donald J. Trump remains in almost every respect a singular character. He exists well outside the boundaries of what most observers previously judged possible, let alone respectable, in American politics. To catalogue the norms he has violated, the traditions he has traduced or trampled, and the rules—written and unwritten—that he has either cunningly sidestepped or audaciously blown to smithereens would require volumes. Love him or loathe him, Trump operates apart from history.

Yet if Trump defies history, paradoxically, he has also resurfaced questions that historians have long debated, including some that many considered settled for many years. In this sense, Trump hasn't just defied history; he has changed it—and he has changed the way that we think about it, forcing us to look back on our past with a new lens.

Story Continued Below

This Politico Magazine series, to be published in three installments over the next few weeks, will look at three historical debates that simmered on low heat for years, until the historic presidential election of November 2016 brought them back to a boil. These debates are foundational. They concern race and identity. National character. The dark side of populism. They drive at the core meaning of American citizenship.

The first in this series, perhaps the most fundamental, centers around the white working class. Are working-class white voters shooting themselves in the foot by making common cause with a political movement that is fundamentally inimical to their economic self-interest? In exchange for policies like the new tax bill, which several nonpartisan analyses conclude will lower taxes on the wealthy and raise them for the working class, did they really just settle for a wall that will likely never be built, a rebel yell for Confederate monuments most of them will never visit, and the hollow validation of a disappearing world in which white was up and brown and black were down?

If they did accept that bargain, why? Or are we missing something? Might working-class whites in fact derive some tangible advantage from their bargain with Trump? Is it really so irrational to care more about, say, illegal immigration than marginal income tax rates?

These are good questions. They're also not new ones. The historian W.E.B. Du Bois asked them more than 80 years ago in his seminal work on Reconstruction, when he posited that working-class Southern whites were complicit, or at least passive instruments, in their own political and economic disenfranchisement. They forfeited real power and material well-being, he argued, in return for the "psychological" wages associated with being white.

Since then, the issue has inspired a vibrant debate among historians. Until last year, most agreed with Du Bois that the answer to the question was not so simple as "yes" or "no"—that whiteness sometimes conferred benefits both imaginary and real.

In the age of Trump, we're once again pressure-testing Du Bois' framework. As one might expect, it's complicated. White identity pays dividends you can easily bank, and some that you can't.



***

In 1935 Du Bois published his most influential treatise, Black Reconstruction, a reconsideration of the period immediately following the Civil War. One of the historical quandaries that Du Bois addressed was the successful effort of white plantation owners in the 1870s and '80s to build a political coalition with poor, often landless, white men to overthrow biracial Reconstruction governments throughout the South.

"The theory of laboring class unity rests upon the assumption that laborers, despite internal jealousies, will unite because of their opposition to the exploitation of the capitalists," wrote Du Bois, who trained at both the University of Berlin and Harvard, and whose grounding in Marxist political economy taught him to view politics through the lens of different but fixed stages in capitalist development. "This would throw white and black labor into one class," he continued, "and precipitate a united fight for higher wages and better working conditions."

That, of course, is not what happened. In most Southern states, poor whites and wealthy whites forged a coalition that overthrew biracial Reconstruction governments and passed a raft of laws that greatly benefited plantation and emerging industrial elites at the expense of small landowners, tenant farmers and factory workers. "It failed to work because the theory of race was supplemented by a carefully planned and slowly evolved method," Du Bois wrote, "which drove such a wedge between white and black workers that there probably are not today in the world two groups of workers with practically identical interests who hate and fear each other so deeply and persistently and who are kept so far apart that neither sees anything of common interest."

Du Bois famously posited that "the white group of laborers, while they received a low wage, were compensated in part by a sort of public and psychological wage. They were given public deference and titles of courtesy because they were white."

Decades before so many white working-class citizens of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin—to say nothing of Alabama, West Virginia and Mississippi—cast their lot with a party that endeavors to raise their taxes and gut their health care, Du Bois identified the problem: Some wages aren't denominated in hard currency. They carry a psychological payoff—even a spiritual one.



***

The most obvious time and place to pressure-test Du Bois' theory is the Jim Crow South. In the 60-odd years between the collapse of Reconstruction and World War II, the South—still reeling from the Civil War, in which it lost the present-day equivalent of approximately $5.5 trillion in real property and wealth—slipped into a semi-permanent state of economic crisis.

In 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt declared the region "the Nation's No. 1 economic problem." It was, as historian Gavin Wright famously observed, a "low-wage region in a high-wage country," one where two-thirds of the population lived in small towns of fewer than 2,500 people, derived meager incomes from agriculture, mining or manufacturing, and even in the midst of a national depression, stood out for poor health, want of education and lack of opportunities for upward mobility.

The vast majority of farmers, black and white, were tenants or sharecroppers, and repressive poll taxes disenfranchised not just black men and women, but also poor white people. Designed by wealthy plantation owners and industrialists, the poll tax was expressly a class measure, meant to preserve the region's prevailing low-tax, low-wage, low-service economy. It was more ingenious and insidious than many people today realize. In Mississippi and Virginia, it was cumulative for two years; if a tenant farmer or textile worker couldn't pay in any given year, not only did he miss an election cycle, he had to pay a full two years' tax to restore his voting rights. In Georgia, the poll tax was cumulative from the time a voter turned 21 years old—meaning, if one missed 10 years, he or she would have to pay a decade's worth of back taxes before regaining the right to vote. In Texas, the tax was due on February 1, in the winter off-season, when farmers were habitually strapped for cash. It was, as one Southern liberal observed at the time, "like buying a ticket to a show nine months ahead of time, and before you know who's playing, or really what the thing is all about."

Little wonder that in 1936, three of four voting-age adults outside the South participated in the presidential election, but in the South, just one in four cast ballots. The system kept men like Eugene Cox, a conservative Democrat who held the powerful post of House Rules Committee chairman, in power. In 1938, Cox won reelection with 5,137 votes, though his district in southwest Georgia had a total population of 263,606 residents.

Yet when working-class Southern whites could participate in the political process, they often jettisoned their natural class interests in favor of racial solidarity. Historians have focused special attention on the rise and fall of the Readjuster movement, a biracial coalition that controlled the Legislature, governor's office and most federal posts in Virginia from 1879 to 1883. Forged in opposition to a conservative Democratic establishment that had shuttered schools, imposed regressive taxes and favored creditors over debtors, the alliance passed a raft of measures that presaged much of the Populist movement's agenda in coming years. For a time, it held. But in 1883, Democrats campaigned with intense focus on the issue of inter-marriage and miscegenation—a rare phenomenon that nevertheless struck a raw nerve with white workers and farmers. They warned that Readjuster rule would result in "mixed schools now and mixed marriages for the future." It worked. Conservative "Bourbon" Democrats regained control of state government and reintroduced regressive, one-party rule that benefited a small minority of Virginians.

To reduce Jim Crow politics to a single trajectory is to oversimplify a complicated story. But the problem of white working-class Southerners bedeviled generations of liberal activists and historians. When the labor federation Congress of Industrial Organizations launched Operation Dixie, a massive effort to unionize Southern workers in the mid-1940s, organizers ran into the same wall: Conservative politicians and their wealthy patrons successfully used race as a cudgel to turn white workers away from collective bargaining agreements that would have raised their wages. Even those Southern populists who ostensibly opposed Bourbon rule—from Georgia's Tom Watson in the early 20th century to Mississippi's Theodore Bilbo in the 1930s—more often flipped the playbook and used race as a blunt instrument against their elite opponents.

Southern liberals in the 1930s and '40s applied a sharp class focus and concluded that wealthy Democrats wanted, in historian Gavin Wright's words, to keep labor "cheap and divided." The white liberal writer Lillian E. Smith famously captured this thinking in her short story "Two Men and a Bargain," which began: "Once upon a time, down South, a rich white man made a bargain with a poor white ... 'You boss the nigger, and I'll boss the money.'"

Critically, Du Bois never insisted that the psychological wages of whiteness were wholly devoid of tangible value. What they forfeited in material benefits, working-class whites also recouped in limited power and privilege. "They were admitted freely with all classes of white people to public functions, public parks, and the best schools," he wrote. "The police were drawn from their ranks. ... The newspapers specialized on news that flattered the poor whites and utterly ignored the Negro except in crime and ridicule. On the other hand, the Negro was subject to insult; was afraid of mobs; was liable to the jibes of children and the unreasoning fears of white women; and was compelled almost continuously to submit to various badges of inferiority." You couldn't necessarily buy groceries with these benefits, but they were palpably meaningful.

David Roediger, a historian of class and race who writes with a Marxian lens, emphasized exactly this point in his classic volume, The Wages of Whiteness, published in 1991 (the title was a direct tribute to Du Bois). He encouraged a generation of scholars to consider that working-class whites may not have been unwitting dupes in their own economic subjugation; instead, they knowingly harvested certain real advantages of whiteness. While this pattern was most visible in the South, it also deeply influenced political culture in the North and West, where whiteness was no less central to popular conceptions of American citizenship. And Roediger's focus was on Northern workers in antebellum cities—workers undergoing the jarring transition from pre-industrial forms of work and leisure to a more regimented existence as wage laborers.

The workers whom Roediger describes, and whom dozens more scholars would similarly study, understood that American citizenship was predicated on race and independence; Congress, after all, had opened citizenship to all "free white persons" in 1790. That law remained on the books into the 20th century. But what did it mean to be "white?" Congress never made that point clear. Indeed, there was no immediate consensus that certain new immigrants met the qualification. And what did it mean to be "free?" Their new status as wage earners—economically dependent on other men to earn a living—seemingly made many working men and women something less than free. Many non-black workers keenly understood that they might be left outside the boundaries of citizenship. They also resented new forms of industrial discipline that their employers foisted onto them. Many addressed these anxieties by drawing a sharp dichotomy between white and black—citizen and slave—and placing themselves on one side of that divide.

They became avid purveyors of blackface minstrelsy—a popular form of entertainment in which working-class whites reveled in watching other working-class whites apply burnt cork to their faces and act out what the historian George Rawick (writing more generally about early American racism) described as a "pornography of [their] former [lives]." The black characters they portrayed on stage were shiftless, sexually promiscuous and rowdy; they reveled in pre-industrial activities like hunting. They were coarse. In short, they deflected on black people, both slave and free, the very same social demerits that wealthier whites—who were trying to impose new discipline on the urban working class—ascribed to them.

Playbills commonly "paired pictures of the performers in blackface and without makeup—rough and respectable," Roediger observed. The former were labeled, "Plantation Darkeys." The latter, "Citizens." By culturally differentiating themselves from black people, actors and audience members alike established themselves as "free white persons."

While it's easy to imagine that working-class whites embraced the new racial dichotomy in order to enjoy leverage in the new urban job market, in many cases, black and white workers weren't even in competition with each other. Many of the most popular blackface actors were former artisans and mechanics—coach makers, typesetters and wood craftsmen who were now increasingly likely to fall into "wage slavery." They were unlikely to vie for employment with free black men, who were normally consigned to unskilled jobs as dockworkers, day laborers and (until Irish women displaced them) domestic servants.

One group that did sometimes compete for unskilled jobs with African-Americans were Irish immigrants. Regarded as racially suspect—depicted in political cartoons as dark and ape-like, and patently unqualified for citizenship—Irish immigrants became some of the most avid and violent practitioners of white identity politics. Even when they weren't in direct competition with black men for jobs—as when a group of Irish hand-loom weavers was displaced by white Protestant weavers in Philadelphia in 1844—they donned blackface and mobbed their black neighbors. The point wasn't to get their jobs back.

Indeed, more was at stake than cash wages. To achieve standing as free white persons—and to enjoy the many benefits of citizenship that accrued from that definition—working-class men in the antebellum era consciously asserted their white identity and set it apart from blackness through language, performance, politics and violence. To imagine that they didn't understand the full impact of their decisions is to deny them any modicum of intelligence or agency.

If working-class whites historically derived both psychological and citizenship wages by privileging race over class, is it possible that they sometimes enjoyed real wages as well? Beginning 25 years ago, a rising generation of political historians including Thomas Sugrue, Kevin Kruse, Matthew Lassiter, Robert Self and Craig Steven Wilder concluded that they did. Giving special focus to labor and housing markets, they found that many working-class white families benefited directly from government policies that placed African-Americans at a disadvantage.

Take housing. Beginning in the 1930s, most mortgages were underwritten by the Federal Housing Administration, a federal agency that insured banks against losses from homeowners who defaulted on their loans. The FHA insured these mortgages in return for securing the banks' pledge to provide home loans at low interest rates and to spread interest payments over at least 15 and as many as 30 years to pay back their loans. At minimal expense to the federal government and with only the pledge of default insurance, the FHA freed up unprecedented levels of capital and helped create a postwar social order in which 60 percent of American households owned and accumulated wealth in their own homes.

In deciding whether or not to insure mortgages, the FHA rated every census tract in the country. Assuming that houses lost value in neighborhoods that were racially mixed or primarily populated by African-Americans and Latinos, the FHA assigned such areas lower scores or "redlined" them altogether, refusing to insure mortgages in these neighborhoods or insuring them on unfavorable terms. This meant that most black Americans could not secure mortgages, as their mere presence in a neighborhood would choke off affordable credit.

In a perverse twist, black residents in many Northern cities had little recourse but to rent cramped, subdivided apartments in buildings whose white landlords often neglected repairs and upkeep, but the physical decay of their homes fed the white Americans' suspicions that black residents chose to live in squalor.

It was not just a matter of housing. A powerful combination of private-sector discrimination and nepotism within trade unions had long excluded black workers from well-paid, blue-collar industries. As George Meany, the president of the AFL-CIO crassly admitted, "When I was a plumber, it never [occurred] to me to have niggers in the union!" Even in liberal bastions like New York City, African-Americans in the 1950s and 1960s composed less than 5 percent of all dock workers, skilled machinists, electricians or unionized carpenters—the types of jobs that afforded non-college educated white men access to middle-class comfort and economic security in the post-war period. The black unemployment rate was double that of the city's overall unemployment rate. And New York was better than most places. In Chicago, 17 percent of black adults in the early 1960s were unemployed. In Cleveland, 20 percent. In Detroit, 39 percent.

By the time federal and state officials got serious about enforcing fair employment laws in the 1970s, America's manufacturing and extractive industries had already fallen into steady decline. In effect, two postwar forces most responsible for lifting millions of working-class families into middle-class comfort and privilege—the suburban housing boom and unionized blue-collar jobs—became available en masse to black Americans only as the post-war boom drew to a close.

This wasn't a simple case of discrimination or inequality. Working-class white families affirmatively enjoyed what the historian George Lipsitz termed a "possessive investment in whiteness." They availed themselves of the G.I. Bill's housing and education benefits, paid for in part by black people's taxes, at a time when black veterans faced sharp limitations on where (or whether) they could draw the same benefits. They accumulated equity in their suburban homes and used it to send their children to college or to save for their retirement. They enjoyed access to public services—from public schools and public trash collection, to clean water and sewage—that were deficient in majority-minority neighborhoods. These advantages conferred second-order benefits, including better health and a higher average life expectancy.

In other words, whiteness did pay real wages. It delivered an intergenerational advantage to those who were in a position to claim it. And white working-class Americans seemed on some level to understand it. When, in 1966, Lyndon Johnson attempted to ram through Congress a law banning racial discrimination in the sale and rental of housing, white working-class voters revolted both in the streets and at the polls. (Ronald Reagan, a washed up former actor, unseated the otherwise popular incumbent governor of California, Pat Brown, largely by touting his opposition to the state's open housing law.) That summer, when Martin Luther King Jr. led protests throughout the "bungalow belt" in Chicago's working-class white neighborhoods and the nearby blue-collar suburb of Cicero, Polish, Italian and Irish residents who had once been staunch Democratic voters now erupted in fury. They pelted protesters with rocks and beat them with clubs amid cries of "White Power!"; "Burn them like Jews"; "We want Martin Luther Coon!"; "Roses are red, violets are black, King would look good with a knife in his back."

Just a few years later, when the federal government began requiring that government contractors and industrial unions that did business with them begin making affirmative efforts to integrate their work forces, white voters gravitated to backlash politicians who promised to preserve their privilege in the job sector. Even as late as 1990, conservative Republican Senator Jesse Helms was able to make openly racist appeals on such grounds and pay no price. On the contrary, it was a winning formula.

The same dynamic that Du Bois grappled with is on display today. In breaking for Donald Trump and the GOP, working-class white voters are manifestly undercutting their economic self-interest. To be sure, Trump didn't campaign like an archetypal GOP plutocrat. He railed against free trade and immigration, policies that many white working-class citizens believe, with some justification, have hurt their communities. He promised to bring back manufacturing and coal mining jobs, eliminate generous tax loopholes for wealthy families like his own, and—like Andrew Jackson, after whom he has patterned his presidency—privilege the many over the few.

But Democrats and Never Trump Republicans shouted at the top of their lungs that Trump's campaign promises either weren't possible or that they wouldn't help working-class voters as much as he pledged. And they appear to have been right. The president recently signed into law a tax bill whose benefits, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and the Congressional Budget Office, accrue principally to corporations and super-rich individuals; many middle-class and working-class families will ultimately face a tax hike. The administration and its congressional supporters have also taken steps to make health care less affordable or altogether inaccessible, destabilize retirement security for working-class families, and allow industrial polluters to despoil the air they breathe and the water they drink. Despite what Trump said on the campaign trail, his agenda does little to help and much to hurt struggling white families.

Of course, whiteness still delivers other dividends—as it always has. It makes one less likely to be killed by a police officer during a traffic stop. It enables white men to carry assault weapons (including long guns) in places of public accommodation, while a black man might be shot and killed by law enforcement officials merely for picking up a BB gun displayed on a sales rack at Walmart. It affords working-class white families the peace of mind that the government won't invade homes or hospitals in pursuit of undocumented children or grandparents. Whiteness, in other words, continues to pay tangible benefits, and rightly or wrongly, it makes some sense that its primary beneficiaries are loath to support candidates who expressly promise to disrupt this privileged status.

Yet Trump has also, arguably more than any other candidate for president in the past hundred years (excepting third-party outliers like Strom Thurmond and George Wallace), played to the purely psychological benefits of being white. From his racially laden exhortations about black crime in Chicago and Latino gangs seemingly everywhere, to his attacks on an American-born federal judge of Mexican parentage and on Muslim gold star parents, he has paid the white majority with redemption and revanchism. Trump might be increasing economic inequality, but at least the working-class whites feel like they belong in Trump's America. He urged them to privilege race over class when they entered their polling stations.

And it didn't just stop there. As Ta-Nehisi Coates argues, Trump swept almost every white demographic group, forging a "broad white coalition that ran the gamut from Joe the Dishwasher to Joe the Plumber to Joe the Banker." It's not just blue-collar white people who seem blithely willing to sacrifice economic rationality for racial solidarity. After all, it arguably took a special kind of stupid for upper-middle class suburbanites in high-tax states to support a party that just raised their taxes. (No, this wasn't a bait-and-switch. The GOP leadership has talked openly about eliminating deductions for state and local taxes since 2014.) Unless, that is, you account for the wages of whiteness.Gov. Rick Scott speaks to the media outside the White House on Sept. 29 following a meeting with President Donald Trump. | Getty Trump's New Year's resolution: Getting Scott to run for Senate in Florida

President Donald Trump wrapped up another private lunch Sunday in South Florida with Gov. Rick Scott, but the biggest political item wasn't on the official New Year's Eve menu at Trump International: Whether Scott will run for U.S. Senate or not in 2018.

No one is a bigger booster of the idea than Trump, who rang in the 2017 New Year with private calls to the term-limited Scott and politicos urging him to challenge Florida's three-term incumbent, Sen. Bill Nelson, the only Democrat elected statewide. In June, Trump publicly called on Scott during a Miami event about Cuba policy to seek the Senate seat. And Trump did it again in September.

Story Continued Below

"I hope this man right here, Rick Scott, runs for the Senate," Trump said after examining Hurricane Irma's damage in Fort Myers and Naples, Scott's hometown.

Each time, Trump has urged him on, Scott has demurred.

And, if the Senate race came up again at lunch, those who know the governor expect him to stay tight-lipped. It's a nod to his cautious and meticulous approach to politics, as well as his awareness of Trump's Twitter trigger finger, which could disclose a secret the governor wants to keep under wraps.

"Rick is careful and he loves the president, but he hasn't made his mind up [about a Senate bid] and he doesn't want this just blurted out," said a Florida Republican insider familiar with the governor's thinking.

A White House spokeswoman said in addition to discussing ongoing hurricane recovery efforts, infrastructure and the tax cut bill in their meeting, the president underscored the importance of Scott's leadership in Florida, and the two indicated that they look forward to working together in the new year.

After this story was initially published, the governor's office said Scott and Trump did not discuss the 2018 Senate race.

As one of 10 Democrats facing reelection in a state Trump won, Nelson is seen as vulnerable by many political insiders. But Trump's relative lack of popularity — and Florida voters' penchant for punishing the party of the president in power — could weigh on Scott, who would probably have to spend tens of millions of his own fortune on a race.

Polls indicate the epic potential matchup between the two is tied.

Scott is expected to make a decision in the coming weeks. He just finished out a $2 million ad blitz funded by his Let's Get to Work political committee, which has about $500,000 cash on hand. Scott is allowed to coordinate, raise and spend unlimited corporate money for the state political committee as long as he's not a federal candidate. Among the nearly $108,000 in expenditures on consultants this month: $56,000 for "research" by OnMessage Inc.

"My view on this is that it's going to be a very tough year for Republicans all over this country," said Chris Ruddy, founder of the conservative NewsMax publication, who's a member of Trump International and Mar-a-Lago. "There's going to be such an anti-Trump wave, because of all the negative media attacks against the president, it's going to be a tough year."

Regardless of how much Trump and Scott talk about politics, they were expected to dwell most on Scott's top issues as governor, according to aides.

"President Trump invited Governor Scott to lunch this Sunday. The governor looks forward to speaking with the president about issues that are important to Floridians, like the needed repairs to the federally operated Herbert Hoover Dike surrounding Lake Okeechobee and the recovery of Florida's citrus industry from Hurricane Irma," said John Tupps, Scott's communications director. "Whenever the governor meets with federal officials, including the president, he advocates for Floridians."

Since Trump's election, Scott has grown closer to the president, whom he has known for decades.

In January, Scott attended a large candlelight dinner honoring Trump. The following month, he joined Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker at a private lunch with the president and talked about Obamacare. The president and Scott then watched "La La Land" at the White House, and they later dined together at Trump International Hotel. They then joined family members and U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage for dinner at the Trump International Hotel Washington.

Weeks later, in March, Scott joined Trump at St. Andrew Catholic School in Orlando for a school-choice event. In the limo ride with the president, Scott and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) pitched Trump on a proposed Cuba crackdown that the president announced the next month.

Also in June, Scott met at the White House to pitch Trump, again, on helping out with infrastructure, and the Okeechobee dike specifically. Later that month, Scott joined Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, at a New York State Republican Committee annual gala.

In August, the topic of infrastructure again was on the table when Scott joined the president for lunch at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. Then, in September, Trump publicly pitched Scott as a Senate candidate after Hurricane Irma struck. Later that month, after Scott visited Puerto Rico as it grappled with Hurricane Maria's destruction, Scott again had lunch at the White House.

"This is not a time for politics," Scott said on the White House lawn at the time as he pledged to "do everything I can" to help the island's governor, Ricardo Rosselló.

But for all the downplaying of politics, it binds Scott and Trump.

Scott now runs the New Republican PAC, which is branded as a pro-Trump super PAC. It is working to "re-brand" the Republican party in Trump's image, including appealing to Hispanic voters.

"Donald Trump's election was a complete shock to the system in Washington," reads the group's website. "This is the perfect opportunity to do things differently."

Though the super PAC is branded as pro-Trump, the site features Scott and has become the landing spot for political contributions from Florida donors that generally give large amounts of money in state — not federal — races, a fact that has led many to speculate the group will play a large role in backing Scott's likely 2018 Senate bid against Nelson.

Among the donors since Scott took over the super PAC are Gulf Coast Health Care, a Pensacola-based company that owns 35 nursing facilities across the state that won a heated intra-party funding fight last session ($40,000); and the holding company of The Villages, a politically powerful retirement community in Central Florida ($100,000).

The committee's treasurer is Mori Hosseini, a longtime Florida Republican rainmaker that Scott appointed to the University of Florida Board of Trustees in 2016, and one of its top advisers is Melissa Stone, a former Scott chief of staff and longtime political consultant.

But there's only so much Scott can fundraise as he enters his lame-duck last 60-day legislative session, which begins Jan. 9. After the budget is fully signed, Scott loses a big amount of fundraising leverage and will have to rely on his personal millions.

Florida Republicans like Ruddy say they expect Trump will continue to urge Scott to run for Senate anyway. He said the two men "have a mutual admiration society" for each other when they're together. And Trump is deeply interested in Florida politics. He even joked that Trump might switch his residence from New York after signing a tax cut bill that makes residency in states like Florida more attractive.

"Donald's adopted home state is Florida. After this whole tax thing, that might change. Who knows?" Ruddy said.After Donald Trump appeared to endorse Ron DeSantis' campaign for Florida governor last week, a handful of the biggest and most influential billionaires in Republican politics threw their support behind the three-term GOP congressman, upending the race in the nation's biggest swing state.

The stable of billionaires and millionaires listed on DeSantis' " Finance Leadership Team ," obtained by POLITICO, includes casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, hedge fund heiress Rebekah Mercer , investment tycoon Foster Friess and other donors who have funded the conservative Koch brothers' network and President Trump's campaign. Just last week, Trump weighed in on Twitter to say that DeSantis "would make a GREAT Governor of Florida."

Story Continued Below

DeSantis has yet to formally announce his 2018 campaign for governor, but his intentions to seek the office became clear in May after he established a state political committee, called the Fund for Florida's Future, that's allowed to raise and spend unlimited soft money from corporate contributors.

"This sets DeSantis apart from the rest. He will have the financial resources and the ground game and the Trump base to be an incredible statewide candidate," said David Bossie, a DeSantis backer who founded the Citizens United conservative group, served as Trump's deputy campaign manager and just co-authored the new "Let Trump Be Trump" book plugged by the president.

Gov. Rick Scott, a Trump loyalist who is leaving office due to term limits, might run for U.S. Senate next year and usually does not endorse in contested Republican primaries.

Normally, national contributors such as Adelson and Mercer don't get involved in state races. But DeSantis has earned their trust and become a sort of "billionaire whisperer," said one Florida-based Republican fundraiser.

As a member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, DeSantis is a frequent Fox News guest who has earned a reputation as a small-government conservative, an opponent of the independent federal investigation of Trump and a supporter of moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. And donors have so far loved what they have heard.

"These big national finance givers are true believers. Donors like Adelson care about Israel, and they watched DeSantis fight for what they care about," the fundraiser said. "They see him consistently boosting Trump on Fox. So here they have a prominent national congressman who speaks their language, pushes their issue and defends their president."

A spokesman for the Adelsons, who own the Las Vegas Sands casino empire, said "there is no decision on the level of financial support" for DeSantis but that the husband and wife duo "appreciate and have great respect for the leadership of Congressman Ron DeSantis on numerous issues."

Mercer's support for DeSantis stands above the others. She manages the political giving of her father, hedge fund magnate Robert Mercer, and played a key role in the Trump transition. The Mercers, top supporters of Trump's campaign, own a stake in the conservative Breitbart media enterprise and the Cambridge Analytica data firm used by Trump's campaign.

Other top DeSantis finance team members include:

• Bernard Marcus, a Home Depot co-founder who has given nearly $18 million to federal campaigns and political committees since 2000, Federal Election Commission records show. Of that money, more than $7 million went to committees supporting Trump's 2016 election.

• Thomas Peterffy, the founder of Interactive Brokers, one of the nation's largest electronic brokerage firms. Peterffy contributed $366,200 in 2016 to two committees helping Trump's election, according to Federal Election Commission records. Peterffy, according to a Time report , was Florida's richest immigrant who supported Trump.

• Foster Friess, a Wyoming-based investor who has toyed with running for U.S. Senate in his home state after talking to Mercer and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. Friess has given more than $4.3 million to federal campaigns and committees since 2000, with more than $2 million going to committees supporting Rick Santorum's presidential campaign in 2012. Friess also donated $100,000 to the Trump Victory PAC in 2016.

• David A. Siegel, the CEO of Westgate Resorts in Orlando, who contributed $30,000 last year to the Trump Victory committee. Many expect the time-share mogul could start playing more in state and national politics with Trump's election. Siegel last year said Trump's election was "the greatest thing that's happened to me since I discovered sex." Siegel's wife, Jackie, said she once went on a few dates with Trump.

One name conspicuously absent from DeSantis' list: Koch. None of the famed conservative brothers have signaled their support for him, though Siegel and other DeSantis backers, such as Dallas investor Doug Deason, are Koch network donors.

In a sign of his rising national profile, DeSantis played golf with Charles Koch in June at a Koch network retreat in Colorado. Another prominent Florida Republican who is considering a bid for governor, state House Speaker Richard Corcoran, didn't get the same face time. While Trump's tweet supporting DeSantis put a damper on Corcoran's prospects, the list of top national donors supporting the congressman makes it even tougher for the state legislative leader to run as the conservative alternative to the GOP front-runner, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam.

Though many of the big-name Republican donors who announced their support of DeSantis have yet to contribute to the congressman, his campaign-to-be is expecting their financial support in the beginning of the year to eat into the hefty fundraising advantage enjoyed by Putnam, who is widely perceived in Florida conservative circles as having a relatively weak right flank in a Republican primary.

In a state as big as Florida, where a week's worth of saturation TV during next year's general election could cost as much as $3 million, cash is king. And Putnam has so far reigned over both his likely and current Democratic and Republican rivals by raising his money from the major industries that do business in Florida's capitol, such as agricultural interests, the health care industry, power companies and Disney.

With Tallahassee's institutional GOP donors behind Putnam, a Republican candidate can hope to match him only with outside money or independent wealth, which was a key to Scott's success in his unexpected primary win in 2010.

Including his campaign and his Florida Grown political committee, Putnam had a total of about $15 million cash on hand at the end of last month. Corcoran, who is not yet an announced candidate, had $4.7 million in the bank in his Watchdog PAC. DeSantis had about $3.6 million in the bank between his political committee and his congressional campaign, whose donors will need to sign off on redirecting their federal contributions to his state race if he runs.

Surveys conducted by Republican pollsters show Putnam leading the GOP primary with less than a third of the vote. DeSantis, depending on the survey, trails by anywhere from 10 points to 20 points. And Corcoran is polling in single digits. More than half of Republican voters say they're not sure whom they'll choose. But 80 percent to 90 percent of them back Trump, the polls show.

Trump's deputy campaign manager, Bossie, said Trump's support for DeSantis and the backing of the top donors should help DeSantis catch up to Putnam quickly.

DeSantis, 39, is a Yale and Harvard Law School graduate and served as a military prosecutor in the Iraq War before he won his congressional seat in 2012. Putnam, 43, has continuously served in elected office since he was elected to the Florida House at the age of 22, then Congress and then to the position of agriculture commissioner.

"I'm a believer that career politicians looking for the next rung on the ladder are a thing of the past," Bossie said. "When you look at that and you compare it to the president of the United States tweeting about Ron, his hard work and his service in the military, he is a game-changing candidate."

Putnam's campaign is dismissing DeSantis as a Washington pol who wouldn't stick with his bid for U.S. Senate last year when Marco Rubio decided to run for reelection after Trump defeated him in Florida's presidential primary.

"I'm hardly concerned about a Washington insider jumping into his second statewide race in two years in desperate search of a promotion. He's not competition, just a stark contrast to Adam Putnam," said Amanda Bevis, Putnam's spokeswoman.

To one of the state's top Republican fundraisers, lobbyist Brian Ballard, the national firepower of DeSantis' finance team is unique.

"It's as impressive a national donor list as I've seen," Ballard said. "The question for Ron is, can he motivate them to get off the list and on to raising and giving considerable dollars? If he does, it will be a huge win for him. If not, it won't be enough to catch Adam Putnam."

Ballard, who once lobbied for Trump and spoke recently with the president about DeSantis, dismissed criticism from others who downplayed the significance of the president's endorsement. Though Trump's endorsement in Alabama's recent special Senate race didn't prove decisive, Ballard said it's "delusional" to believe Trump's support in Florida's primary among DeSantis, Putnam and Corcoran would have no effect.

"Trump's endorsement is incredibly important," Ballard said. "The question is, where does it go from the tweet?"PART I

A GLOBAL THREAT EMERGES

How Hezbollah turned to trafficking cocaine and laundering money through used cars to finance its expansion.

In its determination to secure a nuclear deal with Iran, the Obama administration derailed an ambitious law enforcement campaign targeting drug trafficking by the Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah, even as it was funneling cocaine into the United States, according to a POLITICO investigation.

The campaign, dubbed Project Cassandra, was launched in 2008 after the Drug Enforcement Administration amassed evidence that Hezbollah had transformed itself from a Middle East-focused military and political organization into an international crime syndicate that some investigators believed was collecting $1 billion a year from drug and weapons trafficking, money laundering and other criminal activities.

Over the next eight years, agents working out of a top-secret DEA facility in Chantilly, Virginia, used wiretaps, undercover operations and informants to map Hezbollah's illicit networks, with the help of 30 U.S. and foreign security agencies.

They followed cocaine shipments, some from Latin America to West Africa and on to Europe and the Middle East, and others through Venezuela and Mexico to the United States. They tracked the river of dirty cash as it was laundered by, among other tactics, buying American used cars and shipping them to Africa. And with the help of some key cooperating witnesses, the agents traced the conspiracy, they believed, to the innermost circle of Hezbollah and its state sponsors in Iran.

But as Project Cassandra reached higher into the hierarchy of the conspiracy, Obama administration officials threw an increasingly insurmountable series of roadblocks in its way, according to interviews with dozens of participants who in many cases spoke for the first time about events shrouded in secrecy, and a review of government documents and court records. When Project Cassandra leaders sought approval for some significant investigations, prosecutions, arrests and financial sanctions, officials at the Justice and Treasury departments delayed, hindered or rejected their requests.

They followed cocaine shipments, tracked a river of dirty cash, and traced what they believed to be the innermost circle of Hezbollah and its state sponsors in Iran.

The Justice Department declined requests by Project Cassandra and other authorities to file criminal charges against major players such as Hezbollah's high-profile envoy to Iran, a Lebanese bank that allegedly laundered billions in alleged drug profits, and a central player in a U.S.-based cell of the Iranian paramilitary Quds force. And the State Department rejected requests to lure high-value targets to countries where they could be arrested.

"This was a policy decision, it was a systematic decision," said David Asher, who helped establish and oversee Project Cassandra as a Defense Department illicit finance analyst. "They serially ripped apart this entire effort that was very well supported and resourced, and it was done from the top down."

The untold story of Project Cassandra illustrates the immense difficulty in mapping and countering illicit networks in an age where global terrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime have merged, but also the extent to which competing agendas among government agencies — and shifting priorities at the highest levels — can set back years of progress.

And while the pursuit may be shadowed in secrecy, from Latin American luxury hotels to car parks in Africa to the banks and battlefields of the Middle East, the impact is not: In this case, multi-ton loads of cocaine entering the United States, and hundreds of millions of dollars going to a U.S.-designated terrorist organization with vast reach.

Obama had entered office in 2009 promising to improve relations with Iran as part of a broader rapprochement with the Muslim world. On the campaign trail, he had asserted repeatedly that the Bush administration's policy of pressuring Iran to stop its illicit nuclear program wasn't working, and that he would reach out to Tehran to reduce tensions.

The man who would become Obama's top counterterrorism adviser and then CIA director, John Brennan, went further. He recommended in a policy paper that "the next president has the opportunity to set a new course for relations between the two countries" through not only a direct dialogue, but "greater assimilation of Hezbollah into Lebanon's political system."

By May 2010, Brennan, then assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, confirmed in a speech that the administration was looking for ways to build up "moderate elements" within Hezbollah.

"Hezbollah is a very interesting organization," Brennan told a Washington conference, saying it had evolved from "purely a terrorist organization" to a militia and, ultimately, a political party with representatives in the Lebanese parliament and Cabinet, according to a Reuters report.

"There is certainly the elements of Hezbollah that are truly a concern to us what they're doing," Brennan said. "And what we need to do is to find ways to diminish their influence within the organization and to try to build up the more moderate elements."

In practice, the administration's willingness to envision a new role for Hezbollah in the Middle East, combined with its desire for a negotiated settlement to Iran's nuclear program, translated into a reluctance to move aggressively against the top Hezbollah operatives, according to Project Cassandra members and others.

Lebanese arms dealer Ali Fayad, a suspected top Hezbollah operative whom agents believed reported to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a key supplier of weapons to Syria and Iraq, was arrested in Prague in the spring of 2014. But for the nearly two years Fayad was in custody, top Obama administration officials declined to apply serious pressure on the Czech government to extradite him to the United States, even as Putin was lobbying aggressively against it.

Fayad, who had been indicted in U.S. courts on charges of planning the murders of U.S. government employees, attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization and attempting to acquire, transfer and use anti-aircraft missiles, was ultimately sent to Beirut. He is now believed by U.S. officials to be back in business, and helping to arm militants in Syria and elsewhere with Russian heavy weapons.

Project Cassandra members say administration officials also blocked or undermined their efforts to go after other top Hezbollah operatives including one nicknamed the "Ghost," allowing them to remain active despite being under sealed U.S. indictment for years. People familiar with his case say the Ghost has been one of the world's biggest cocaine traffickers, including to the U.S., as well as a major supplier of conventional and chemical weapons for use by Syrian President Bashar Assad against his people.

And when Project Cassandra agents and other investigators sought repeatedly to investigate and prosecute Abdallah Safieddine, Hezbollah's longtime envoy to Iran, whom they considered the linchpin of Hezbollah's criminal network, the Justice Department refused, according to four former officials with direct knowledge of the cases.

The administration also rejected repeated efforts by Project Cassandra members to charge Hezbollah's military wing as an ongoing criminal enterprise under a federal Mafia-style racketeering statute, task force members say. And they allege that administration officials declined to designate Hezbollah a "significant transnational criminal organization" and blocked other strategic initiatives that would have given the task force additional legal tools, money and manpower to fight it.

Former Obama administration officials declined to comment on individual cases, but noted that the State Department condemned the Czech decision not to hand over Fayad. Several of them, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were guided by broader policy objectives, including de-escalating the conflict with Iran, curbing its nuclear weapons program and freeing at least four American prisoners held by Tehran, and that some law enforcement efforts were undoubtedly constrained by those concerns.

The Justice Department, they pointed out, never filed corresponding U.S. criminal charges against the suspects arrested in Europe.

But the former officials denied that they derailed any actions against Hezbollah or its Iranian allies for political reasons.

"There has been a consistent pattern of actions taken against Hezbollah, both through tough sanctions and law enforcement actions before and after the Iran deal," said Kevin Lewis, an Obama spokesman who worked at both the White House and Justice Department in the administration.

Lewis, speaking for the Obama administration, provided a list of eight arrests and prosecutions as proof. He made special note of a February 2016 operation in which European authorities arrested an undisclosed number of alleged members of a special Hezbollah business affairs unit that the DEA says oversees its drug trafficking and other criminal money-making enterprises.

Project Cassandra officials, however, noted that the European arrests occurred after the negotiations with Iran were over, and said the task force initiated the multinational partnerships on its own, after years of seeing their cases shot down by the Justice and State departments and other U.S. agencies.

The Justice Department, they pointed out, never filed corresponding U.S. criminal charges against the suspects arrested in Europe, including one prominent Lebanese businessman formally designated by the Treasury Department for using his "direct ties to Hezbollah commercial and terrorist elements" to launder bulk shipments of illicit cash for the organization throughout Asia, Europe and the Middle East.

A former senior national security official of the Obama administration, who played a role in the Iran nuclear negotiations, suggested that Project Cassandra members were merely speculating that their cases were being blocked for political reasons. Other factors, including a lack of evidence or concerns about interfering with intelligence operations could have been in play.

"What if the CIA or the Mossad had an intelligence operation ongoing inside Hezbollah and they were trying to pursue someone ... against whom we had impeccable [intelligence] collection and the DEA is not going to know that?" the official said. "I get the feeling people who don't know what's going on in the broader universe are grasping at straws."

The official added: "The world is a lot more complicated than viewed through the narrow lens of drug trafficking. So you're not going to let CIA rule the roost, but you're also certainly not going to let DEA do it either. Your approach to anything as complicated as Hezbollah is going to have to involve the interagency [process], because the State Department has a piece of the pie, the intelligence community does, Treasury does, DOD does."

Nonetheless, other sources independent of Project Cassandra confirmed many of the allegations in interviews with POLITICO, and in some cases, in public comments.

One Obama-era Treasury official, Katherine Bauer, in little-noticed written testimony presented last February to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, acknowledged that "under the Obama administration ... these [Hezbollah-related] investigations were tamped down for fear of rocking the boat with Iran and jeopardizing the nuclear deal."

As a result, some Hezbollah operatives were not pursued via arrests, indictments, or Treasury designations that would have blocked their access to U.S. financial markets, according to Bauer, a career Treasury official, who served briefly in its Office of Terrorist Financing as a senior policy adviser for Iran before leaving in late 2015. And other "Hezbollah facilitators"arrested in France, Colombia, Lithuania have not been extradited — or indicted — in the U.S., she wrote.

Bauer, in an interview, declined to elaborate on her testimony.

David Asher, for one, said Obama administration officials expressed concerns to him about alienating Tehran before, during and after the Iran nuclear deal negotiations. This was, he said, part of an effort to "defang, defund and undermine the investigations that were involving Iran and Hezbollah," he said.

"The closer we got to the [Iran deal], the more these activities went away" — David Asher, who helped establish and oversee Project Cassandra

"The closer we got to the [Iran deal], the more these activities went away," Asher said. "So much of the capability, whether it was special operations, whether it was law enforcement, whether it was [Treasury] designations — even the capacity, the personnel assigned to this mission — it was assiduously drained, almost to the last drop, by the end of the Obama administration."

With much fanfare, Obama announced the final agreement on implementation of the Iran deal on Jan. 17, 2016, in which Tehran promised to shelve efforts to build a nuclear weapons program in exchange for being released from crippling international economic sanctions.

Within months, task force officials said, Project Cassandra was all but dead. Some of its most senior officials, including Jack Kelly, the veteran DEA supervisory agent who created and led the task force, were transferred to other assignments. And Asher himself left the task force long before that, after the Defense Department said his contract would not be renewed.

As a result, the U.S. government lost insight into not only drug trafficking and other criminal activity worldwide, but also into Hezbollah's illicit conspiracies with top officials in the Iranian, Syrian, Venezuelan and Russian governments — all the way up to presidents Nicolas Maduro, Assad and Putin, according to former task force members and other current and former U.S. officials.

The derailment of Project Cassandra also has undermined U.S. efforts to determine how much cocaine from the various Hezbollah-affiliated networks is coming into the United States, especially from Venezuela, where dozens of top civilian and military officials have been under investigation for more than a decade. Recently, the Trump administration designated the country's vice president, a close ally of Hezbollah and of Lebanese-Syrian descent, as a global narcotics kingpin.

Meanwhile, Hezbollah — in league with Iran — continues to undermine U.S. interests in Iraq, Syria and throughout wide swaths of Latin America and Africa, including providing weapons and training to anti-American Shiite militias. And Safieddine, the Ghost and other associates continue to play central roles in the trafficking of drugs and weapons, current and former U.S. officials believe.

"They were a paramilitary organization with strategic importance in the Middle East, and we watched them become an international criminal conglomerate generating billions of dollars for the world's most dangerous activities, including chemical and nuclear weapons programs and armies that believe America is their sworn enemy," said Kelly, the supervisory DEA agent and lead coordinator of its Hezbollah cases.

"If they are violating U.S. statutes," he asked, "why can't we bring them to justice?"

Kelly and Asher are among the officials involved in Project Cassandra who have been quietly contacted by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans, who said a special POLITICO report April 24 on Barack Obama's hidden Iran deal concessions raised urgent questions about the need to resurrect key law enforcement programs to counter Iran.

That won't be easy, according to former Project Cassandra members, even with President Donald Trump's recent vow to crack down on Iran and Hezbollah. They said they tried to keep the project on life support, in hopes that it would be revived by the next administration, but the loss of key personnel, budget cuts and dropped investigations are only a few of many challenges made worse by the passage of nearly a year since Trump took office.

"Sources evaporate. Who knows if we can find all of the people willing to testify?" —Jack Kelly, the veteran DEA supervisory agent

"You can't let these things disintegrate," said Kelly. "Sources evaporate. Who knows if we can find all of the people willing to testify?"

Derek Maltz, who oversaw Project Cassandra as the head of the DEA's Special Operations Division for nine years ending in July 2014, put it this way: "Certainly there are targets that people feel that could have been indicted and weren't. There is certainly an argument to be made that if tomorrow all the agencies were ordered to come together and sit in a room and put all the evidence on the table against all these bad guys, that there could be a hell of a lot of indictments."

But Maltz said the damage wrought by years of political interference will be hard to repair.

"There's no doubt in my mind now that the focus was this Iran deal and our initiative was kind of like a fly in the soup," Maltz said. "We were the train that went off the tracks."

Project Cassandra had its origins in a series of investigations launched in the years after the 9/11 attacks which all led, via their own twisted paths, to Hezbollah as a suspected global criminal enterprise.

Operation Titan, in which the DEA worked with Colombian authorities to explore a global alliance between Lebanese money launderers and Colombian drug trafficking conglomerates, was one. Operation Perseus, targeting Venezuelan syndicates, was another. At the same time, DEA agents in West Africa were investigating the suspicious flow of thousands of used cars from U.S. dealerships to car parks in Benin.

Meanwhile, in Iraq, the U.S. military was probing the role of Iran in outfitting Shiite militias with high-tech improvised explosive devices known as Explosively Formed Penetrators, or EFPs, that had already killed hundreds of U.S. soldiers.

All of these paths eventually converged on Hezbollah.

This wasn't entirely a surprise, agents say. For decades, Hezbollah — in close cooperation with Iranian intelligence and Revolutionary Guard — had worked with supporters in Lebanese communities around the world to create a web of businesses that were long suspected of being fronts for black-market trading. Along the same routes that carried frozen chicken and consumer electronics, these businesses moved weapons, laundered money and even procured parts for Iran's illicit nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

As they pursued their investigations, the DEA agents found that Hezbollah was redoubling all of these efforts, working urgently to raise cash, and lots of it, to rebuild its south Lebanon stronghold after a 2006 war with Israel had reduced it to rubble.

Hezbollah mostly left the United States alone, in what was clearly a strategic decision to avoid U.S. retaliation.

Dating back to its inception in the early 1980s, Hezbollah, which translates to "Party of God," had also engaged in "narcoterrorism," collecting a tariff from drug dealers and other black-market suppliers who operated in territory it controlled in Lebanon and elsewhere. Now, based on the DEA's extensive network of informants, undercover operatives and wiretaps, it looked like Hezbollah had shifted tactics, and gotten directly involved in the global cocaine trade, according to interviews and documents, including a confidential DEA assessment.

"It was like they flipped a switch," Kelly told POLITICO. "All of a sudden, they reversed the flow of all of the black-market activity they had been taxing for years, and took control of the operation."

Operating like an organized crime family, Hezbollah operatives would identify businesses that might be profitable and useful as covers for cocaine trafficking and buy financial stakes in them, Kelly and others said. "And if the business was successful and suited their current needs," Kelly said, "they went from partial owners to majority owners to full partnership or takeover."

Hezbollah even created a special financial unit that, translated into English, means "Business Affairs Component," to oversee the sprawling criminal operation, and it was run by the world's most wanted terrorist after Osama bin Laden, a notoriously vicious Hezbollah military commander named Imad Mughniyeh, according to DEA interviews and documents.

Mughniyeh had for decades been the public face of terrorism for Americans, orchestrating the infamous attack that killed 241 U.S. Marines in 1983 in their barracks in Lebanon, and dozens more Americans in attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Beirut that year and an annex the year after. When President Ronald Reagan responded to the attacks by withdrawing peacekeeping troops from Lebanon, Hezbollah claimed a major victory and vaulted to the forefront of the Islamist resistance movement against the West.

Over the next 25 years, Iran's financial and military support for Hezbollah enabled it to amass an army with tens of thousands of foot soldiers, more heavy armaments than most nation-states and approximately 120,000 rockets and ballistic missiles that could strike Israel and U.S. interests in the region with devastating precision.

Hezbollah became an expert in soft power, as well. It provided food, medical care and other social services for starving refugees in war-torn Lebanon, winning credibility on the ground. It then evolved further into a powerful political party, casting itself as the defender of poor, mostly Shiite Lebanese against Christian and Sunni Muslim elites. But even as Hezbollah was moving into the mainstream of Lebanese politics, Mughniyeh was overseeing a secret expansion of its terrorist wing, the Islamic Jihad Organization. Working with Iranian intelligence agents, Islamic Jihad continued to attackWestern, Israeli and Jewish targets around the world, and to conduct surveillance on others — including in the United States — in preparation for future attacks.

Hezbollah mostly left the United States alone, in what was clearly a strategic decision to avoid U.S. retaliation. But by 2008, the Bush administration came to believe that Islamic Jihad was the most dangerous terrorist organization in the world, capable of launching instantaneous attacks, possibly with chemical, biological or low-grade nuclear weapons, that would dwarf those on 9/11.

While the DEA had quickly proven itself adept at working on the global stage, few people within the U.S. government thought of it as a legitimate counterterrorism force.

By funding terrorism and military operations through global drug trafficking and organized crime, Mughniyeh's business affairs unit within Islamic Jihad had become the embodiment of the kind of threat the United States was struggling to address in the post-9/11 world.

The DEA believed that it was the logical U.S. national security agency to lead the interagency effort to go after Mughniyeh's drug trafficking networks. But within the multipronged U.S. national security apparatus, this was both a questionable and problematic assertion.

Established by President Richard Nixon in 1973 to bring together the various anti-drug programs under the Department of Justice, the DEA was among the youngest of the U.S. national security agencies.

And while the DEA had quickly proven itself adept at working on the global stage — especially in partnerships with drug-infested countries desperate for U.S. help like Colombia — few people within the U.S. government thought of it as a legitimate counterterrorism force.

In the final years of the Bush administration, though, the DEA had won the support of top officials for taking down two major international arms dealers, a Syrian named Monzer al-Kassarand the Russian "Lord of War," Viktor Bout. And thanks to supportive Republicans in Congress, it had become the beneficiary of a new federal law that empowered its globe-trotting cadre of assault-weapon-toting Special Operations agents.

The statute allowed DEA agents to operate virtually anywhere, without permission required from other U.S. agencies. All they needed to do was connect drug suspects to terrorism, and they could arrest them, haul them back to the United States and flip them in an effort to penetrate "the highest levels of the world's most significant and notorious criminal organizations," as then-Special Operations chief Derek Maltz told Congress in November 2011.

As they crunched the massive amounts of intel streaming into the DEA's Counter Narco-Terrorism Operations Center in Chantilly, Virginia, the agents on Operation Titan, Perseus and the other cases began to connect the dots and map the contours of one overarching criminal enterprise.

PART II

EVERYWHERE AND NOWHERE

From its headquarters in the Middle East, Hezbollah extends its criminal reach to Latin America, Africa and the United States.

On Feb. 12, 2008, CIA and Israeli intelligence detonated a bomb in Imad Mughniyeh's car as he was leaving a celebration of the 29th anniversary of the Iranian revolution in Damascus, Syria. He was killed instantly. It was a major blow to Hezbollah, but soon after, wiretapped phone lines and other U.S. evidence showed that his criminal operation was busier than ever, and overseen by two trusted associates, according to interviews with former Project Cassandra officials and DEA documents.

One was financier Adham Tabaja. The other, the interviews and documents reveal, was Safieddine, the key link between Hezbollah — which was run by his cousin, Hassan Nasrallah and his own brother Hashem — and Iran, Hezbollah's state sponsor, which saw the group as its strategic ally in defending Shiite Muslims in the largely Sunni Muslim states that surrounded it.

Investigators were also homing in on several dozen key players underneath them who acted as "superfacilitators" for the various criminal operations benefitting Hezbollah, Iran and, at times, their allies in Iraq, Syria, Venezuela and Russia.

But it was Safieddine, a low-key, bespectacled man with a diplomatic bearing, who was their key point of connection from his base in Tehran, investigators believed.

The Colombia and Venezuela investigations linked him to numerous international drug smuggling and money laundering networks, and especially to one of the biggest the DEA had ever seen, led by Medellin-based Lebanese businessman Ayman Joumaa.

Ayman Saied Joumaa's network rang alarm bells in Washington when agents discovered he was working with Mexico's brutal Los Zetas cartel to move multi-ton loads of cocaine directly into the United States, and washing $200 million a month in criminal proceeds with the help of 300 or so used car dealerships. The network would funnel huge amounts of money to the dealerships to purchase used cars, which would then be shipped to Benin, on Africa's west coast.

As the task force investigators intensified their focus on Safieddine, they were contacted out of the blue by Asher, the Defense Department official, who was at Special Operations Command tracking the money used to provide ragtag Iraqi Shiite militias with sophisticated weapons for use against U.S. troops, including the new and lethal IED known as the "Explosively Formed Penetrator." The armor-piercing charges were so powerful that they were ripping M1 Abrams tanks in half.

"Nobody had seen weapons like these," Asher told POLITICO. "They could blow the side off a building."

Asher's curiosity had been piqued by evidence linking the IED network to phone numbers intercepted in the Colombia investigation. Before long, he traced the unusual alliance to a number allegedly used by Safieddine in Iran.

"I had no clue who he was," Asher recalled. "But this guy was sending money into Iraq, to kill American soldiers."

"I had no clue who he was. But this guy was sending money into Iraq, to kill American soldiers" — David Asher on Abdallah Safieddine

Thanks to that chance connection, the Pentagon's then-head of counternarcotics, William Wechsler, lent Asher and a few other Defense Department experts in tracking illicit money to the DEA to see what they might find.

It was a fruitful partnership. Asher was accustomed to toiling in the financial shadows. During his 20-plus years of U.S. government work, his core expertise was in exposing money laundering and schemes to avoid financial sanctions by rogue nation states, terrorist groups, organized-crime cartels and weapons proliferation networks.

Usually, his work was strictly classified. For Project Cassandra, however, he got special dispensation from the Pentagon to build networks of unclassified information so it could be used in criminal prosecutions.

Asher and his team quickly integrated cutting-edge financial intelligence tools into the various DEA investigations. With the U.S. military's help, agents translated thousands of hours of intercepted phone conversations from Colombia in Arabic that no one had considered relevant until the Hezbollah links appeared.

When the translations were complete, investigators said, they painted a picture of Safieddine as a human hub of a criminal enterprise with spokes emanating from Tehran outward into Latin America, Africa, Europe and the United States via hundreds of legitimate businesses and front companies.

Safieddine did not respond to requests for comment through various intermediaries including Hezbollah's media arm. A Hezbollah official, however, denied that the organization was involved in drug dealing.

"Sheik Nasrallah has confirmed lots of times that it is not permitted religiously for Hezbollah members to be trafficking drugs," the official said. "It is something that is preventable, in that we in Islam have things like halal [permitted] and haram [prohibited]. For us, this is haram. So in no way is it possible to be done."

The accusation that Hezbollah is involved in drug trafficking, the representative said, "is part of the campaign to distort the image of Hezbollah as a resistance movement against the Israelis. Of course, it is possible to have Lebanese people involved in drugs, but it is not possible for them to be members of Hezbollah. This is absolutely not possible."

Asked about Safieddine's role in the organization, the official said, "We don't usually expose the roles everyone plays because it is a jihadi organization. So it is a little bit secret."

Safieddine's cousin Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, has publicly rejected the idea that Hezbollah needs to raise money at all, through drugs or any other criminal activity, because Iran provides whatever funds it needs.

Safieddine himself, however, suggested otherwise in 2005, when he defiantly refuted the Bush administration's accusations that Iran and Syria supplied Hezbollah with weapons. Those countries provided "political and moral" support only, he told Agence France-Presse. "We don't need to arm ourselves from Tehran. Why bring weapons from Iran via Syria when we can procure them anywhere in the world?"

"Hezbollah operates like the Gambino crime family on steroids, and he is its John Gotti" — John Kelly on Abdallah Safieddine

Safieddine may have been right. Agents found evidence that weapons were flowing to Hezbollah from many channels, including networks that trafficked in both drugs and weapons. And using the same trafficking networks that hummed with drugs, cash and commercial products, agents concluded, Safieddine was overseeing Hezbollah efforts to help Iran procure parts and technology for its clandestine nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

"Hezbollah operates like the Gambino crime family on steroids, and he is its John Gotti," said Kelly, referring to the infamous "Teflon Don" crime boss who for decades eluded justice. "Whatever Iran needs, Safieddine is in charge of getting it for them."

The Bush administration had made disrupting the networks through which Iran obtained parts for its weapons of mass destruction programs a top priority, with then-Deputy National Security Adviser Juan Zarate personally overseeing an interagency effort to map out the procurement channels. A former Justice Department prosecutor, Zarate understood the value of international law enforcement operations, and put DEA's Special Operations Division at the center of it.

But even then, other agencies were chafing at the DEA's role.

A Series of Roadblocks

Much of the early turbulence stemmed from an escalating turf battle between federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies over which ones had primacy in the global war on terrorism, especially over a so-called hybrid target like Hezbollah, which was both a criminal enterprise and a national security threat.

The "cops" from the FBI and DEA wanted to build criminal cases, throw Hezbollah operatives in prison and get them to turn on each other. That stoked resentment among the "spooks" at the CIA and National Security Agency, who for 25 years had gathered intelligence, sometimes through the painstaking process of having agents infiltrate Hezbollah, and then occasionally launching assassinations and cyberattacks to block imminent threats.

Further complicating the picture was the role of the State Department, which often wanted to quash both law-enforcement actions and covert operations due to the political backlash they created. Hezbollah, after all, was a leading political force in Lebanon and a provider of human services, with a sincere grass-roots following that wasn't necessarily aware of its unsavory actions. Nowhere was the tension between law enforcement and diplomacy more acute than in dealings with Hezbollah, which was fast becoming a key part of the Lebanese government.

Distrust among U.S. agencies exploded after two incidents brought the cops-spooks divide into clear relief.

In the waning days of the Bush administration, a DEA agent's cover was blown just as he was about to become a Colombian cartel's main cocaine supplier to the Middle East — and to Hezbollah operatives.

A year later, under Obama, the State Department blocked an FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force from luring a key eyewitness from Beirut to Philadelphia so he could be arrested and turned against Safieddine and other Hezbollah operatives in a scheme to procure 1,200 Colt M4 military-grade assault rifles.

In both cases, law enforcement agents suspected that Middle East-based spies in the CIA had torpedoed their investigations to protect their politically sensitive and complicated relationship with Hezbollah.

The CIA declined to comment on the allegation that it intentionally blew the cover of a DEA agent or any other aspect of its relationship with Project Cassandra. The Obama State Department and Justice Department also declined to comment in response to detailed requests about their dealings with Hezbollah.

But the tensions between those agencies and the DEA were no secret. Some current and former diplomats and CIA officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, portrayed DEA Special Operations agents as undisciplined and overly aggressive cowboys with little regard for the larger geopolitical picture. "They'd come in hot to places like Beirut, want to slap handcuffs on people and disrupt operations we'd been cultivating for years," one former CIA case officer said.

"They refused to accept no for an answer. And they were often given no for an answer" — FBI terrorism task force supervisor

Kelly and other agents embraced their swashbuckling reputation, claiming that more aggressive tactics were needed because the CIA had long turned a blind eye to Hezbollah's criminal networks, and even cultivated informants within them, in a misguided and myopic focus on preventing terrorist attacks.

The unyielding posture of Kelly, Asher and their team also rankled some of their fellow law-enforcement agents within the FBI, the Justice Department and even the DEA itself. The more Kelly and Asher insisted that everyone else was missing the drug-crime-terror nexus, the more others accused them — and their team out at Chantilly — of inflating those connections to expand the task force's portfolio, get more funding and establish its importance.

After a few years of working together on the Hezbollah cases, Kelly and Asher had become a familiar sight in the never-ending circuit of meetings and briefings in what is known as the "interagency process," a euphemism for the U.S. national security community's efforts to bring all elements of power to bear on a particular problem.

From outward appearances, the two made an unusual pair.

Kelly, now 51, was a streetwise agent from small-town New Jersey who cut his teeth investigating the Mafia and drug kingpins. He spent his infrequent downtime lifting weights, watching college football and chilling in cargo shorts.

Asher, 49, speaks fluent Japanese, earned his Ph.D. in international relations from Oxford University and has the pallor of a senior government official who has spent the past three decades in policy meetings, classified military war rooms and diplomatic summits.

Both were described by supporters and detractors alike as having a similarly formidable combination of investigative and analytical skills, and the self-confidence to match it. At times, and especially on Project Cassandra, their intensity worked to the detriment of their careers.

"It got to the point where a lot of people didn't want to have meetings with them," said one FBI terrorism task force supervisor who worked often with the two. "They refused to accept no for an answer. And they were often given no for an answer. Even though they were usually right."

"We should also not forget about the 100's of used car companies in the states — some of them owned by Islamic Extremists — which are part of this network" — Jack Kelly

An early flash point was Operation Titan, the DEA initiative in Colombia. After its undercover agent was compromised, DEA and Colombian authorities scrambled to build cases against as many as 130 traffickers, including a Colombian cartel leader and a suspected Safieddine associate named Chekry Harb, nicknamed El Taliban.

For months afterward, the Justice Department rebuffed requests by task force agents, and some of its own prosecutors, to add narcoterrorism charges to the drug and money-laundering counts against Harb, several sources involved in the case said. Agents argued that they had evidence that would easily support the more serious charges. Moreover, Harb's prosecution was an essential building block in their larger plan for a sustained legal assault against Hezbollah's criminal network.

Its centerpiece would be a prosecution under the Racketeer Act, a powerful tool used by the Justice Department against sophisticated international conspiracies, including the Mafia, drug cartels and white-collar corporate crimes. A RICO case would give the task force the ability to tie many seemingly unconnected conspiracies together, and prosecute the alleged bosses overseeing them, like Safieddine, participants say.

It would also allow authorities to seize potentially billions in assets, they say, and to use the threat of far longer prison terms to wring more cooperation out of Harb and others already charged or convicted.

After the Justice Department's final refusal to bring narcoterrorism charges against Harb, Kelly sent an angry email to the DEA leadership warning that Justice's "obstruction" would have "far reaching implications including threats to our National Security" given Hezbollah's mushrooming criminal activity.

Of particular concern: A 25–year-old Lebanese man that Kelly described as the network's "command and control element," according to the email.

The young man was not only in contact "with Joumaa and some of the other top drug traffickers in the world" but also "leaders of a foreign [country's] black ops special forces; executive leadership of Hezbollah; and a representative of a company which is most likely facilitating the development of WMDs."

"We should also not forget," he added, "about the 100's of used car companies in the states — some of them owned by Islamic Extremists — which are part of this network." In interviews, former task force officials identified the young man as Safieddine's son, and said he acted as his father's liaison in Beirut.

All of that information was shared with other law enforcement and intelligence agencies — and the White House — via the DEA's Chantilly nerve center. But by early 2009, Obama's national security team batted down Project Cassandra's increasingly urgent warnings as being overly alarmist, counterproductive or untrue, or simply ignored them, according to Kelly, Asher, Maltz and other participants in and out of government.

By following the money, though, Asher had become convinced that the task force wasn't overhyping the threat posed by Hezbollah's criminal activities, it was significantly underestimating it. Because Hezbollah's drug trafficking was bankrolling its Islamic Jihad military wing and joint ventures with Iran, as Asher would later testify before Congress, it represented "the largest material support scheme for terrorism operations" the world had ever seen.

As proof, Asher would often bring PowerPoints to interagency drug and crime meetings, showing how cash reserves of U.S currency in Lebanon had doubled, to $16 billion, in just a few years, and how shiny new skyscrapers were popping up around Beirut, just like Miami, Panama City, Panama, and other cities awash in drug money.

Privately, Asher began to tell task force colleagues, the best way to take down the entire criminal enterprise — especially such a politically sensitive one as Hezbollah — was to go after its money, and the financial institutions assisting it. Their first target would be one of the world's fastest-growing banks, the Beirut-based Lebanese Canadian Bank and its $5 billion in assets.

Blocked efforts, missed opportunities

Asher knew how to successfully implode the financial underpinnings of an illicit, state-sponsored trafficking network because he'd already done it, just a few years earlier, as the Bush administration's point man on North Korea. In that case, he used the post-9/11 PATRIOT Act to cut off Pyongyang by going after Banco Delta Asia, a Macau-based bank that made illicit financial transactions on behalf of the North Korean regime.

In Beirut, Asher and his team worked with an Israeli intelligence operation to penetrate the Lebanese bank's inner workings and diagram its Byzantine money flows. They gathered evidence showing how Joumaa's network alone was laundering $200 million per month in "bulk proceeds of drug sales" through the bank and various money exchange houses, according to Justice and Treasury department documents.

Much of the freshly laundered cash, the records show, was then wired to about 300 U.S. used-car dealers to buy and ship thousands of vehicles to West Africa.

"Right now, we have 50 FBI agents not doing anything because they know their Iran cases aren't going anywhere" — Jack Kelly on what a Justice Department official told him about the chilling effect of Obama's rapprochement with Iran

Task force agents also documented how Safieddine was a financial liaison providing Hezbollah — and, of potentially huge significance, Iran — with VIP services at the bank, including precious access to the international financial system in violation of U.S. sanctions, according to those records.

By then, the task force was working closely with federal prosecutors in a new Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit out of the Justice Department's Southern District of New York. The Manhattan prosecutors agreed to file criminal charges against the bank and two senior officials that they hoped to turn into cooperating witnesses against Hezbollah and Safieddine, several participants said.

Federal authorities filed a civil action against the bank in February 2011 and later seized $102 million, ultimately forcing it to shut down and sell its assets without admitting wrongdoing. But the Justice Department never filed the criminal charges, and also stymied investigations into other financial institutions and individuals that task force agents targeted as part of the planned case, they say.

The Obama White House said privately that it feared a broader assault on Lebanese financial institutions would destabilize the country. But without the threat of prison time, complicit bank officials clammed up. And without pressure on the many other financial institutions in Lebanon and the region, Hezbollah simply moved its banking business elsewhere.

Soon afterward, Kelly said, he ran into one of the unit's top prosecutors and asked if there was "something going on with the White House that explains why we can't get a criminal filing."

"You don't know the half of it," the prosecutor replied, according to Kelly. "Right now, we have 50 FBI agents not doing anything because they know their Iran cases aren't going anywhere," including investigations around the U.S. into allegedly complicit used-car dealers.

Justice Department officials involved, including then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and other prosecutors, declined requests to discuss the bank case or others involving Hezbollah.

That October, Asher helped uncover a plot by two Iranian agents and a Texas-based Iranian-American to hire Mexican cartel gunmen to assassinate Saudi Arabia's U.S. ambassador in a crowded Washington cafe. A month later, prosecutors indicted Joumaa, accusing him of working with Mexico's Zetas cartel and Colombian and Venezuelan suppliers to smuggle 85 tons of cocaine into the U.S., and laundering $850 million in drug proceeds.

Task force agents hoped those cases would win them the political support needed to attack the Hezbollah criminal network and its patrons in Tehran. Instead, the opposite appeared to be happening.

DEA officials weren't included in the Justice and FBI news conference on the assassination plot, and claim it was because the Obama White House wanted to downplay the drug-terror connection. And Joumaa's indictment didn't mention Hezbollah once, despite DEA evidence of his connections to the group dating back to 1997.

By the end of 2012, senior officials at the Justice Department's National Security and Criminal divisions, and at the State Department and National Security Council, had shut down, derailed or delayed numerous other Hezbollah-related cases with little or no explanation, according to Asher, Kelly, Maltz and other current and former participating officials.

Agents discovered "an entire Quds force network" in the U.S., laundering money, moving drugs and illegally smuggling Bell helicopters, night-vision goggles and other items for Iran, Asher said.

"We crashed to indict" the elite Iranian unit, and while some operatives were eventually prosecuted, other critically important indictments "were rejected despite the fact that we had excellent evidence and testifying witnesses," said Asher, who helped lead the investigation.

In Philadelphia, the FBI-led task force had spent two years bolstering its case claiming that Safieddine had overseen an effort to purchase 1,200 military-grade assault rifles bound for Lebanon, with the help of Kelly and the special narcoterrorism prosecutors in New York.

Now, they had two key eyewitnesses. One would identify Safieddine as the Hezbollah official sitting behind a smoked-glass barricade who approved the assault weapons deal. And an agent and prosecutor had flown to a remote Asian hotel and spent four days persuading another eyewitness to testify about Safieddine's role in an even bigger weapons and drugs conspiracy, multiple former law enforcement officials confirmed to POLITICO.

Some Obama officials warned that further crackdowns against Hezbollah would destabilize Lebanon.

Convinced they had a strong case, the New York prosecutors sent a formal prosecution request to senior Justice Department lawyers in Washington, as required in such high-profile cases. The Justice Department rejected it, and the FBI and DEA agents were never told why, those former officials said.

Justice Department officials declined to comment on the case.

Kelly had been searching for an appropriate DEA code name to give to collaborating agencies so they could access and contribute to task force investigative files. He found it while reading the Erik Larson book "In the Garden of Beasts," in which the former U.S. ambassador to Germany named his U.S. speaking tour about the growing Nazi menace after the famous mythological figure whose warnings about the future were unheeded.

Now the project had its name: Cassandra.

Standing down on Hezbollah

After Obama won reelection in November 2012, the administration's pushback on Hezbollah drug cases became more overt, and now seemed to be emanating directly from the White House, according to task force members, some former U.S. officials and other observers.

One reason, they said, was Obama's choice of a new national security team. The appointment of John Kerry as secretary of state was widely viewed as a sign of a redoubled effort to engage with Iran. Obama's appointment of Brennan — the public supporter of cultivating Hezbollah moderates — as CIA director, and the president's choice of the Justice Department's top national security lawyer, Lisa MonacoLisa Monaco, as Brennan's replacement as White House counterterrorism and homeland security adviser, put two more strong proponents of diplomatic engagement with Iran in key positions.

Another factor was the victory of reformist candidate Hassan Rouhani as president of Iran that summer, which pushed the talks over a possible nuclear deal into high gear.

The administration's eagerness for an Iran deal was broadcast through so many channels, task force members say, that political appointees and career officials at key agencies like Justice, State and the National Security Council felt unspoken pressure to view the task force's efforts with skepticism. One former senior Justice Department official confirmed to POLITICO that some adverse decisions might have been influenced by an informal multi-agency Iran working group that "assessed the potential impact" of criminal investigations and prosecutions on the nuclear negotiations.

Monaco was a particularly influential roadblock at the intersection of law enforcement and politics, in part due to her sense of caution, her close relationship with Obama and her frequent contact with her former colleagues at the Justice Department's National Security Division, according to several task force members and other current and former officials familiar with its efforts.

Some Obama officials warned that further crackdowns against Hezbollah would destabilize Lebanon. Others warned that such actions would alienate Iran at a critical early stage of the serious Iran deal talks. And some officials, including Monaco, said the administration was concerned about retaliatory terrorist or military actions by Hezbollah, task force members said.

"That was the established policy of the Obama administration internally," one former senior Obama national security official said, in describing the reluctance to go after Hezbollah for fear of reprisal. He said he criticized it at the time as being misguided and hypocritical.

"We're obviously doing those actions against al Qaeda and ISIS all the time," the Obama official said. "I thought it was bad policy [to refrain from such actions on Hezbollah] that limited the range of options we had," including criminal prosecutions.

Monaco declined repeated requests for comment, including detailed questions sent by email and text, though a former White House subordinate of hers rejected the task force members' description of her motives and actions.

The couriers were lugging suitcases stuffed with as much as $2 million each, and the task force was on the tail of every one of them.

The White House was driven by a broader set of concerns than the fate of the nuclear talks, the former White House official said, including the fear of reprisals by Hezbollah against the United States and Israel, and the need to maintain peace and stability in the Middle East.

Brennan also told POLITICO he was not commenting on any aspect of his CIA tenure. His former associates, however, said that he remained committed to preventing Hezbollah from committing terrorist acts, and that his decisions were based on an overall concern for U.S. security.

For their part, task force agents said they tried to work around the obstacles presented by the Justice and State Departments and the White House. Often, they chose to build relatively simple drug and weapons cases against suspects rather than the ambitious narcoterrorism prosecutions that required the approval of senior Justice Department lawyers, interviews and records show.

At the same time, though, they redoubled efforts to build a case and gain Justice Department support for it.

Their ace in the hole, Kelly and Asher said they told Justice officials, wasn't some dramatic drug bust, but thousands of individual financial transactions, each of which constituted an overt criminal act under RICO. Much of this evidence grew out of the Lebanese Canadian Bank investigation, including details of how an army of couriers for years had been transporting billions of dollars in dirty U.S. cash from West African car dealerships to friendly banks in Beirut.

The couriers would begin their journeys at a four-star hotel in Lome, Togo, lugging suitcases stuffed with as much as $2 million each, Kelly said. And the task force was on the tail of every one of them, he said, thanks to an enterprising DEA agent who had found a way to get all of their cellphone numbers. "They had no idea what we were doing," Kelly said. "But that alone gave us all the slam-dunk evidence we needed" for a RICO case against everyone involved in the conspiracy, including Hezbollah.

Such on-the-ground spadework, combined with its worldwide network of court-approved communications intercepts, gave Project Cassandra agents virtual omniscience over some aspects of the Hezbollah criminal network.

And from their perch in Chantilly, they watched with growing alarm as Hezbollah accelerated its global expansion that the drug money helped finance.

Both Hezbollah and Iran continued to build up their military arsenals and move thousands of soldiers and weapons into Syria. Aided by the U.S. military withdrawal from Iraq, Iran, with the help of Hezbollah, consolidated its control and influence over wide swaths of the war-ravaged country.

Iran and Hezbollah began making similar moves into Yemen and other Sunni-controlled countries. And their networks in Africa trafficked not just in drugs, weapons and used cars but diamonds, commercial merchandise and even human slaves, according to interviews with former Project Cassandra members and Treasury Department documents. Hezbollah and the Quds force also were moving into China and other new markets.

But Project Cassandra's agents were most alarmed, by far, by the havoc Hezbollah and Iran were wreaking in Latin America.

A threat in America's backyard

In the years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when Washington's focus was elsewhere, Hezbollah and Iran cultivated alliances with governments along the "cocaine corridor" from the tip of South America to Mexico, to turn them against the United States.

The strategy worked in Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela, which evicted the DEA, shuttering strategic bases and partnerships that had been a bulwark in the U.S. counternarcotics campaign.

In Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez was personally working with then-Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and Hezbollah on drug trafficking and other activities aimed at undermining U.S. influence in the region, according to interviews and documents.

"If we had gotten our hands on either of them, we could have taken down the entire network" — Kelly on the extradition of a top Venezuelan official and a drug kingpin

Within a few years, Venezuelan cocaine exports skyrocketed from 50 tons a year to 250, much of it bound for American cities, United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime statistics show.

And beginning in 2007, DEA agents watched as a commercial jetliner from Venezuela's state-run Conviasa airline flew from Caracas to Tehran via Damascus, Syria, every week with a cargo-hold full of drugs and cash. They nicknamed it "Aeroterror," they said, because the return flight often carried weapons and was packed with Hezbollah and Iranian operatives whom the Venezuelan government would provide with fake identities and travel documents on their arrival.

From there, the operatives spread throughout the subcontinent and set up shop in the many recently opened Iranian consulates, businesses and mosques, former Project Cassandra agents said.

But when the Obama administration had opportunities to secure the extradition of two of the biggest players in that conspiracy, it failed to press hard enough to get them extradited to the United States, where they would face charges, task force officials told POLITICO.

One was Syrian-born Venezuelan businessman Walid Makled, alias the "king of kingpins," who was arrested in Colombia in 2010 on charges of shipping 10 tons of cocaine a month to the United States. While in custody, Makled claimed to have 40 Venezuelan generals on his payroll and evidence implicating dozens of top Venezuelan officials in drug trafficking and other crimes. He pleaded to be sent to New York as a protected, cooperating witness, but Colombia — a staunch U.S. ally — extradited him to Venezuela instead.

The other, retired Venezuelan general and former chief of intelligence Hugo Carvajal, was arrested in Aruba on U.S. drug charges. Carvajal "was the main man between Venezuela and Iran, the Quds force, Hezbollah and the cocaine trafficking," Kelly said. "If we had gotten our hands on either of them, we could have taken down the entire network."

Instead, Venezuela was now the primary pipeline for U.S.-bound cocaine, thanks in part to the DEA's success in neighboring Colombia. It had also become a strategically invaluable staging area for Hezbollah and Iran in the United States' backyard, including camps they established to train Shiite militias.

And at the center of much of that activity was the Ghost, another suspected Safieddine associate so elusive that no photos of him were said to exist.

Project Cassandra agents came to regard the Ghost as perhaps the most important on-the-ground operator in the conspiracy because of his suspected role in moving drugs, money and munitions, including multi-ton loads of cocaine, into the United States, and WMD components to the Middle East, according to two former senior U.S. officials.

Now, he and Joumaa were living in Beirut, and Project Cassandra agents were so familiar with their routines that they knew at which cafe the two men gathered every morning to drink espresso and "discuss drug trafficking, money laundering and weapons," one of the two former officials said.

The Ghost was also in business with another suspected Safieddine associate, Ali Fayad, who had long been instrumental in providing weapons to Shiite militias in Iraq, including through the deadly IED network that had killed so many U.S. troops, the former officials believed.

Now, they had information that Fayad, a joint Lebanese and Ukrainian citizen, and the Ghost were involved in moving conventional and chemical weapons into Syria for Hezbollah, Iran and Russia to help President Assad crush the insurgency against his regime. Adding to the mystery: Fayad served as a Ukrainian defense ministry adviser, worked for the state-owned arms exporter Ukrspecexport and appeared to have taken Bout's place as Putin's go-to arms merchant, the former officials said.

So when Fayad's name surfaced in a DEA investigation in West Africa as a senior Hezbollah weapons trafficker, agents scrambled to create a sting operation, with undercover operatives posing as Colombian narcoterrorists plotting to shoot down American government helicopters.

Hezbollah's network moved "metric ton quantities of cocaine [to] launder drug proceeds on a global scale, and procure weapons and ... explosives" — Excerpt of a Confidential DEA assessment

Fayad was happy to offer his expert advice, and after agreeing to provide them with 20 Russian-made shoulder-fired Igla surface-to-air missiles, 400 rocket-propelled grenades and various firearms and rocket launchers for $8.3 million, he was arrested by Czech authorities on a U.S. warrant in April 2014, U.S. court records show.

The Fayad sting — and his unprecedented value as a potential cooperating witness — was just one of many reasons Project Cassandra members had good cause, finally, for optimism.

PART III

A BATTLE AGAINST ENEMIES FAR AND NEAR

As negotiations for the Iran nuclear deal intensify, the administration pushes back against Project Cassandra.

More than a year into Obama's second term, many national security officials still disagreed with Kelly and Asher about whether Hezbollah fully controlled a global criminal network, especially in drug trafficking and distribution, or merely profited from crimes by its supporters within the global Lebanese diaspora. But Project Cassandra's years of relentless investigation had produced a wealth of evidence about Hezbollah's global operations, a clear window into how its hierarchy worked and some significant sanctions by the Treasury Department.

A confidential DEA assessment from that period concluded that Hezbollah's business affairs entity "has leveraged relationships with corrupt foreign government officials and transnational criminal actors ... creating a network that can be utilized to move metric ton quantities of cocaine, launder drug proceeds on a global scale, and procure weapons and precursors for explosives."

Hezbollah "has at its disposal one of the most capable networks of actors coalescing elements of transnational organized crime with terrorism in the world," the assessment concluded.

Some top U.S. military officials shared those concerns, including the four-star generals heading U.S. Special Operations and Southern commands, who warned Congress that Hezbollah's criminal operations and growing beachhead in Latin America posed an urgent threat to U.S. security, according to transcripts of the hearings.

"The intelligence community fundamentally doubted the intel" from the DEA, the subordinate recalled.

In early 2014, Kelly and other task force members briefed Attorney General Eric Holder, who was so alarmed by the findings that he insisted Obama and his entire national security team get the same briefing as they formulated the administration's Iran strategy.

So task force leaders welcomed the opportunity to attend a May 2014 summit meeting of Obama national security officials at Special Operations Command headquarters in Tampa, Florida. Task force leaders hoped to convince the administration of the threat posed by Hezbollah's networks, and of the need for other agencies to work with DEA in targeting the growing nexus of drugs, crime and terror.

The summit, and several weeks of interagency prep that preceded it, however, prompted even more pushback from some top national security officials. Monaco, Obama's counterterrorism adviser, expressed concerns about using RICO laws against top Hezbollah leaders and about the possibility of reprisals, according to several people familiar with the summit.

They said senior Obama administration officials appeared to be alarmed by how far Project Cassandra's investigations had reached into the leadership of Hezbollah and Iran, and wary of the possible political repercussions.

As a result, task force members claim, Project Cassandra was increasingly viewed as a threat to the administration's efforts to secure a nuclear deal, and the top-secret prisoner swap that was about to be negotiated.

Monaco's former subordinate, speaking under on condition of anonymity, said the White House did not attempt to curb DEA-led efforts against Hezbollah because of the Iran deal. But the subordinate said the White House felt a need to balance the drug agency's interests with those of other agencies who often disagreed with it.

"The intelligence community fundamentally doubted the intel" from the DEA, the subordinate recalled. "I spent so much time trying to get them to work together."

Nonetheless, after the meeting in Tampa, the administration made it clear that it would not support a RICO case, even though Asher and others say they'd spent years gathering evidence for it, the task force members said.

In addition, the briefings for top White House and Justice Department officials that had been requested by Holder never materialized, task force agents said. (Holder did not respond to requests for comment.) Also, a top intelligence official blocked the inclusion of Project Cassandra's memo on the Hezbollah drug threat from being included in Obama's daily threat briefing, they said. And Kelly, Asher and other agents said they stopped getting invitations to interagency meetings, including those of a top Obama transnational crime working group.

That may have been because Obama officials dropped Hezbollah from the formal list of groups targeted by a special White House initiative into transnational organized crime, which in turn effectively eliminated DEA's broad authority to investigate it overseas, task force members said.

"The funny thing is Tampa was supposed to settle how everyone would have a seat at the table and what the national strategy is going to be, and how clearly law enforcement has role," Jack Riley, who was the DEA's chief of operations at the time, told POLITICO. "And the opposite happened. We walked away with nothing."

Willfully blind to the threat

After the Tampa meeting, Project Cassandra leaders pushed – unsuccessfully, they said – for greater support from the Obama administration in extraditing Fayad from the Czech Republic to New York for prosecution, and in locating and arresting the many high-value targets who went underground after hearing news of his arrest.

They also struck out repeatedly, they said, in obtaining the administration's approval for offering multimillion-dollar "rewards for justice" bounties of a type commonly issued for indicted kingpins like Joumaa, and for the administration to unseal the secret indictments of others, like the Ghost, to improve the chances of catching them.

And task force officials pushed the Obama team, also unsuccessfully, to use U.S. aid money and weapons sales as leverage to push Lebanon into adopting an extradition treaty and handing over all of the indicted Hezbollah suspects living openly in the country, they said.

"There were ways of getting these guys if they'd let us," Kelly said.

Frustrated, he wrote another of his emails to DEA leaders in July 2014, asking for help.

The email stated that the used-car money-laundering scheme was flourishing in the United States and Africa. The number of vehicles being shipped to Benin had more than doubled from December 2011 to 2014, he wrote, with one dealership alone receiving more than $4 million.

And despite the DEA's creation of a multi-agency "Iran-Hezbollah Super Facilitator Initiative" in 2013, Kelly said, only the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Patrol was sharing information and resources.

"The nuclear negotiations are on their own. They're standing separate from anything else" — Secretary of State John Kerry to reporters

"The FBI and other parts of the USG [U.S. government] provide a little or no assistance during our investigations," Kelly wrote in the email. "The USG lack of action on this issue has allowed [Hezbollah] to become one of the biggest transnational organized crime groups in the world."

Around this time, people outside Project Cassandra began noting that senior administration officials were increasingly suspicious of it.

Douglas Farah, a transnational crime analyst, said he tried to raise the Project Cassandra investigations with Obama officials in order to corroborate his own on-the-ground research, without success. "When it looked like the [nuclear] agreement might actually happen, it became clear that there was no interest in dealing with anything about Iran or Hezbollah on the ground that it may be negative, that it might scare off the Iranians," said Farah.

Asher, meanwhile, said he and others began hearing "from multiple people involved in the Iran discussions that this Hezbollah stuff was definitely getting in the way of a successful negotiation," he said. One Obama national security official even said so explicitly in the same State Department meeting in which he boasted about how the administration was bringing together a broad coalition in the Middle East, including Hezbollah, to fight the Islamic State terrorist group, Asher recalled.

Indeed, the United States was seeking Iran's help in taking on the Islamic State. As the nuclear deal negotiations were intensifying ahead of a November 2014 diplomatic deadline, Obama himself secretly wrote to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to say the two countries had a mutual interest in fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Kerry, who was overseeing the negotiations, rejected suggestions that the nuclear deal was linked to other issues affecting the U.S-Iranian relationship.

"The nuclear negotiations are on their own," he told reporters. "They're standing separate from anything else. And no discussion has ever taken place about linking one thing to another."

The Obama team "really, really, really wanted the deal" — Former CIA officer on how intelligence operations were also impacted by negotiations with Iran

But even some former CIA officials said the negotiations were affecting their dealings in the Middle East and those of the DEA.

DEA operations in the Middle East were shut down repeatedly due to political sensitivities, especially in Lebanon, according to one former CIA officer working in the region. He said pressure from the White House also prompted the CIA to declare "a moratorium" on covert operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon, too, for a time, after the administration received complaints from Iranian negotiators.

"During the negotiations, early on, they [the Iranians] said listen, we need you to lay off Hezbollah, to tamp down the pressure on them, and the Obama administration acquiesced to that request," the former CIA officer told POLITICO. "It was a strategic decision to show good faith toward the Iranians in terms of reaching an agreement."

The Obama team "really, really, really wanted the deal," the former officer said.

As a result, "We were making concessions that had never been made before, which is outrageous to anyone in the agency," the former intelligence officer said, adding that the orders from Washington especially infuriated CIA officers in the field who knew that Hezbollah "was still doing assassinations and other terrorist activities."

That allegation was contested vehemently by the former senior Obama national security official who played a role in the Iran nuclear negotiations. "That the Iranians would ask for a favor in this realm and that we would acquiesce is ludicrous," he said.

Nonetheless, feeling that he had few options left, Asher went public with his concerns at a congressional hearing in May 2015 saying, "the Department of Justice should seek to indict and prosecute" Hezbollah's Islamic Jihad Organization as an international conspiracy using the RICORICO case statute. That was the only way, he testified, for U.S. officials to "defeat narcoterrorism financing, including that running right through the heart of the American financial system," as Hezbollah was doing with the used-cars scheme.

The nuclear deal was signed in July 2015, and formally implemented on Jan. 17, 2016. A week later, almost two years after his arrest, Czech officials finally released Fayad to Lebanon in exchange for five Czech citizens that Hezbollah operatives had kidnapped as bargaining chips.

Unlike in the case of Bout, the former arms trafficker for Putin, neither Obama nor other senior White House officials made personal pleas for the extradition of Fayad, task force officials said. Afterward, the U.S. Embassy in the Czech Republic issued a statement saying, "We are dismayed by the Czech government's decision."

For the task force, Fayad's release was one of the biggest blows yet. Some agents told POLITICO that Fayad's relationships with Hezbollah, Latin American drug cartels and the governments of Iran, Syria and Russia made him a critically important witness in any RICO prosecution and in virtually all of their ongoing investigations.

"He is one of the very few people who could describe for us the workings of the operation at the highest levels," Kelly said. "And the administration didn't lift a finger to get him back here."

One senior Obama administration official familiar with the case said it would be a stretch to link the Fayad case to the Iran deal, even if the administration didn't lobby aggressively enough to have Fayad extradited to the United States.

"I guess it's possible that they [the White House] didn't want to try hard because of the Iran deal but I don't have memories of it," said the former official. "Clearly there were things that the Obama administration did to keep the negotiations alive, prudent negotiating tactics to keep the Iranians at the table. But to be fair, there was a lot of shit we did during the Iran deal negotiations that pissed the Iranians off."

Afterward, Czech President Milos Zeman told local media he had freed Fayad at the personal request of Putin, a close ally of both the Czech Republic and Iran, who had lobbied hard for his release in a series of phone calls like the ones Project Cassandra officials were hoping Obama would make.

A week later, European authorities, working with the DEA and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, arrested an undisclosed number of Hezbollah-related suspects in France and neighboring countries on charges of using drug trafficking money to procure weapons for use in Syria.

In announcing the arrests, the DEA and the Justice Department disclosed for the first time the existence of Project Cassandra, as well as its target, the drug-and weapons-trafficking unit known as Hezbollah's Business Affairs Component. In a news release, DEA also said the business entity "currently operates under the control of Abdallah Safieddine" and Tabaja.

Jack Riley, the DEA's acting deputy administrator, said in the news release that Hezbollah's criminal operations "provide a revenue and weapons stream for an international terrorist organization responsible for devastating terror attacks around the world."

Riley described the operation as "ongoing," saying "DEA and our partners will continue to dismantle networks who exploit the nexus between drugs and terror using all available law enforcement mechanisms."

But Kelly and some other agents had already come to believe that the arrests would be a last hurrah for the task force, as it was crumbling under pressure from U.S. officials eager to keep the newly implemented Iran deal intact. That's why Project Cassandra members insisted on including Safieddine's name in the media releases. They wanted it in the public record, in case they had no further opportunity to expose the massive conspiracy they believed he had been overseeing.

A last hurrah

The news release caused a stir. The CIA was furious that Project Cassandra went public with details of Hezbollah's business operations. And the French government called off a joint news conference planned to announce the arrests. Kelly, who was already in Paris awaiting the news conference, said European authorities told him the French didn't want to offend Iran, which just 11 days after the nuclear deal implementation had agreed to buy 118 French Airbus aircraft worth about $25 billion.

"Given the group's ever-lengthening criminal rap sheet around the world, designating it as a TCO [Transnational Criminal Organization] has become an open-and-shut case" — Matthew Levitt

Two weeks later, after firing off another angry email or two, Kelly said he was told by his superiors that he was being transferred against his wishes to a gang unit at DEA headquarters. He retired months later on the first day he was eligible.

Several other key agents and analysts also transferred out on their own accord, in some cases in order to receive promotions, or after being told by DEA leaders that they had been at the Special Operations Division for too long, according to Kelly, Asher, Maltz and others.

Meanwhile, the administration was resisting demands that it produce a long-overdue intelligence assessment that Congress had requested as a way of finally resolving the interagency dispute over Hezbollah's role in drug trafficking and organized crime.

It wasn't just a bureaucratic exercise. More than a year earlier, Congress – concerned that the administration was whitewashing the threat posed by Hezbollah – passed the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act. That measure required the White House to lay out in writing its plans for designating Hezbollah a "significant transnational criminal organization."

The White House delegated responsibility for the report to the office of the director of National Intelligence, prompting immediate accusations by the task force and its allies that the administration was stacking the deck against such a determination, and against Project Cassandra, given the intelligence community's doubts about the DEA's conclusions about Hezbollah's drug-running.

"Given the group's ever-lengthening criminal rap sheet around the world, designating it as a TCO [Transnational Criminal Organization] has become an open-and-shut case," Matthew Levitt, a former senior Treasury official, said of Hezbollah in an April 2016 policy paper for a Washington think tank.

Agents from Project Cassandra and other law enforcement agencies "investigate criminal activities as a matter of course and are therefore best positioned to judge whether a group has engaged in transnational organized crime," wrote Levitt, who is also a former FBI analyst and author of a respected book on Hezbollah. "Intelligence agencies are at a disadvantage in this regard, so the DNI's forthcoming report should reflect the repeated findings of law enforcement, criminal courts, and Treasury designations."

As expected, the administration's final report, which remains classified, significantly downplayed Hezbollah's operational links to drug trafficking, which in turn further marginalized the DEA's role in fighting it, according to a former Justice Department official and others familiar with the report.

Once the Obama administration left office, in January 2017, the logjam of task force cases appeared to break, and several task force members said it wasn't a coincidence.

An alleged top Hezbollah financier, Kassim Tajideen, was arrested in Morocco — seven years after Treasury officials blacklisted him as a sponsor of terror — and flown to Washington to stand trial. Asher said task force agents had kept his case under wraps, hoping for a better outcome in whatever administration succeeded Obama's.

The Trump administration also designated Venezuelan Vice President Tareck Aissami as a global narcotics kingpin, almost a decade after DEA agents became convinced he was Hezbollah's point man within the Chavez, and then Maduro, regimes.

Ironically, many senior career intelligence officials now freely acknowledge that the task force was right all along about Hezbollah's operational involvement in drug trafficking. "It dates back many years," said one senior Directorate of National Intelligence official.

"They are a global threat, particularly if the Trump relationships turn sour" — Magnus Ranstorp

Meanwhile, Hezbollah — in league with Iran, Russia and the Assad regime — has all but overwhelmed the opposition groups in Syria, including those backed by the United States. Hezbollah continues to help train Shiite militants in other hotspots and to undermine U.S. efforts in Iraq, according to U.S. officials. It also continues its expansion in Latin America and, DEA officials said, its role in trafficking cocaine and other drugs into the United States. And it is believed to be the biggest trafficker of the powerful stimulant drug Captagon that is being used by fighters in Syria on all sides.

Progress has been made on other investigations and prosecutions, current and former officials said. But after an initial flurry of interest in resurrecting Project Cassandra, the Trump administration has been silent on the matter. In all of the Trump administration's public condemnations of Hezbollah and Iran, the subject of drug trafficking hasn't come up.

In West Africa, satellite imagery has documented that the Hezbollah used-car money-laundering operation is bigger than ever, Asher told lawmakers in recent testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

And Hezbollah continues to scout potential U.S. targets for attack if it decides Washington has crossed some red line against it or Iran. On June 1, federal authorities arrested two alleged Hezbollah operatives who were conducting "pre-operational surveillance" on possible targets for attack, including the FBI headquarters in New York and the U.S. and Israeli embassies in Panama.

"They are a global threat, particularly if the Trump relationships turn sour" with Iran, Syria and Russia, said Magnus Ranstorp, one of the world's foremost Hezbollah experts.

The June arrests "bring into sharp focus that the Iranians are making contingency plans for when the U.S. turns up the heat on Iran," said Ranstorp, research director of the Center for Asymmetric Threat Studies at the Swedish National Defence College, who is in frequent contact with U.S. intelligence officials. "If they think it requires some military or terrorist response, they have been casing targets in the U.S. since the late 1990s."

Ranstorp said U.S. intelligence officials believe that Hezbollah's U.S.-based surveillance is far more extensive than has been publicly disclosed, and that they are particularly concerned about the battle-hardened operatives who have spent years on the ground in Syria.

"The U.S. intel community is very concerned about this," Ranstorp said. Hezbollah's agents "have become extremely sophisticated and good at fighting."

Maltz, the longtime head of DEA Special Operations, who retired two months after the Tampa summit in 2014, has lobbied since then for better interagency cooperation on Hezbollah, to tackle both the terrorist threat and the criminal enterprise that underwrites it.

Turf battles, especially the institutional conflict between law enforcement and intelligence agencies, contributed to the demise of Project Cassandra, Maltz said. But many Project Cassandra agents insist the main reason was a political choice to prioritize the Iranian nuclear agreement over efforts to crack down on Hezbollah.

"They will believe until death that we were shut down because of the Iran deal," Maltz said. "My gut feeling? My instinct as a guy doing this for 28 years is that it certainly contributed to why we got pushed aside and picked apart. There is no doubt in my mind."Hanning says Germany's "security architecture needs to be urgently improved in order to meet new challenges" | Michael Kappeler/EPA German ex-intelligence chief warns of 'uncomfortable' security situation August Hanning says Germany will have problems 'as long as we let people come into the country without identity papers.'

BERLIN — Germany's security situation could become "uncomfortable" if border controls are not strengthened, a former intelligence chief said.

"As the terrorist attacks and attempted attacks in the last two years have shown, the security situation in Germany is very tense," August Hanning, who ran Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND) from 1998 to 2005, told Sunday newspaper Bild am Sonntag.

"Our security architecture needs to be urgently improved in order to meet new challenges," he continued. "Otherwise it threatens to become very uncomfortable for us in Germany."

Hanning, who has long been critical of Chancellor Angela Merkel's refugee policies, said there's an undeniable "link between internal security and efficient border control." He called for increased staff and improved intelligence capabilities within Germany's security agencies.

Hanning said the country has clearly learned from the case of Anis Amri, the 2016 Berlin Christmas market attacker who was already known to German authorities. Still, he argued it's "negligent" for Germany to allow in so many refugees without adequate identity controls.

"I believe everyone involved learned from that case, and things have improved a great deal," he said. "But as long as we let people come into the country without identity papers, without clear identity controls, we will have a big security problem."

The ex-intelligence chief also stressed the importance of integration for new arrivals, saying there are still "big deficits" in Germany's ability to integrate refugees and asylum-seekers who hope to stay long-term.

"Within Europe, Germany is the promised land for asylum-seekers and migrants," he said. "And I ask myself how long we can continue this without big social disruptions."Tesla has been hyping its Model 3 vehicles since they were announced in 2014. The car was designed to be an affordable all-electric sedan, but despite receiving approximately half a million pre-orders the company has so far only delivered a few hundred units. However, that might be about to change: Electrek is reporting that 'hundreds' of new Model 3s have been leaving the Tesla factory over the past few days.

Electrek published drone video footage yesterday of a parking lot at the Tesla factory in Fremont full of Model 3s being loaded onto trucks. This comes after footage last week of the that same factory with an estimated 500 Model 3s in the same parking lot. It's unclear whether the footage published yesterday features the same cars as the video published a week ago, or if these are new cars.

Either way, this represents a significant acceleration in Tesla's Model 3 production. The company only delivered 712 Model 3s total by November, and according to these videos the company stands to nearly double that number in December.

This means that Tesla might be on track to meet its 2018 goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by March 2018. If that's the case, people might not have to wait as long for their cars as they thought.Ялинку у соборі святого Віта у Празі прикрасили листками з назвами окупованих міст Донбасу.

Про це повідомив посол України в Чехії Євген Перебийніс.

"Прага. Головний собор Чехії — Собор святого Віта. Новорічна ялинка в кольорах українського прапора. Замість прикрас — назви українських міст на Донбасі, окупованих Росією. Дякуємо за підтримку! Вони обов'язково будуть звільнені. Слава Україні! З Новим роком!", — написав посол у Facebook.North Korea celebrates New Year with fireworks

The graphic content of some of the posts reprinted within this article may offend some readers. However, our belief is that readers cannot fully understand the importance of how hate speech is handled without seeing it unvarnished and unredacted.

Facebook's community standards prohibit violent threats against people based on their religious practices. So when ProPublica reader Holly West saw this graphic Facebook post declaring that "the only good Muslim is a fucking dead one," she flagged it as hate speech using the social network's reporting system.

Warning: This image contains offensive material. Click to view.

Facebook declared the photo to be acceptable. The company sent West an automated message stating: "We looked over the photo, and though it doesn't go against one of our specific Community Standards, we understand that it may still be offensive to you and others."

But Facebook took down a terser anti-Muslim comment — a single line declaring "Death to the Muslims," without an accompanying image — after users repeatedly reported it.

Both posts were violations of Facebook's policies against hate speech. But only one of them was caught by Facebook's army of 7,500 censors — known as content reviewers — who decide whether to allow or remove posts flagged by its 2 billion users. After being contacted by ProPublica, Facebook also took down the one West complained about.

Warning: This image contains offensive material. Click to view.

Such inconsistent Facebook rulings are not unusual, ProPublica has found in an analysis of more than 900 posts submitted to us as part of a crowd-sourced investigation into how the world's largest social network implements its hate-speech rules. Based on this small fraction of Facebook posts, its content reviewers often make different calls on items with similar content, and don't always abide by the company's complex guidelines. Even when they do follow the rules, racist or sexist language may survive scrutiny because it is not sufficiently derogatory or violent to meet Facebook's definition of hate speech.

We asked Facebook to explain its decisions on a sample of 49 items, sent in by people who maintained that content reviewers had erred, mostly by leaving hate speech up, or in a few instances by deleting legitimate expression. In 22 cases, Facebook said its reviewers had made a mistake. In 19, it defended the rulings. In six cases, Facebook said the content did violate its rules but its reviewers had not actually judged it one way or the other because users had not flagged it correctly, or the author had deleted it. In the other two cases, it said it didn't have enough information to respond.

See Comparisons What Does Facebook Consider Hate Speech? Our analysis shows that Facebook's content reviewers often make different calls on whether to allow or delete items with similar content. See the inconsistencies.

"We're sorry for the mistakes we have made — they do not reflect the community we want to help build," Facebook Vice President Justin Osofsky said in a statement. "We must do better." He said Facebook will double the size of its safety and security team, which includes content reviewers and other employees, to 20,000 people in 2018, in an effort to enforce its rules better.

He added that Facebook deletes about 66,000 posts reported as hate speech each week, but that not everything offensive qualifies as hate speech. "Our policies allow content that may be controversial and at times even distasteful, but it does not cross the line into hate speech," he said. "This may include criticism of public figures, religions, professions, and political ideologies."

In several instances, Facebook ignored repeated requests by users to delete hateful content that violated its guidelines. At least a dozen people, as well as the Anti-Defamation League in 2012, lodged protests with Facebook to no avail about a page called Jewish Ritual Murder. However, after ProPublica asked Facebook about the page, it was taken down.

Facebook's guidelines are very literal in defining a hateful attack, which means that posts expressing bias against a specific group but lacking explicitly hostile or demeaning language often stay up, even if they use sarcasm, mockery or ridicule to convey the same message. Because Facebook tries to write policies that can be applied consistently across regions and cultures, its guidelines are sometimes blunter than it would like, a company spokesperson said.

Consider this photo of a black man missing a tooth and wearing a Kentucky Fried Chicken bucket on his head. The caption states: "Yeah, we needs to be spending dat money on food stamps wheres we can gets mo water melen an fried chicken."

ProPublica reader Angie Johnson reported the image to Facebook and was told it didn't violate their rules. When we asked for clarification, Facebook said the image and text were okay because they didn't include a specific attack on a protected group.

By comparison, a ProPublica reader, who asked not to be named, shared with us a post about race in which she expressed exasperation with racial inequality in America by saying, "White people are the fucking most." Her comment was taken down by Facebook soon after it was published.

How Facebook handles such speech is important because hate groups use the world's largest social network to attract followers and organize demonstrations. After the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, this summer, CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged to step up monitoring of posts celebrating "hate crimes or acts of terrorism." Yet some activists for civil rights and women's rights end up in "Facebook jail," while pages run by groups listed as hateful by the Southern Poverty Law Center are decked out with verification checkmarks and donation buttons.

In June, ProPublica reported on the secret rules that Facebook's content reviewers use to decide which groups are "protected" from hate speech. We revealed that the rules protected "white men" but not "black children" because "age," unlike race and gender, was not a protected category. (In response to our article, Facebook added the category of "age" to its protected characteristics.) However, since subgroups are not protected, an attack on poor children, beautiful women, or Indian taxi cab drivers would still be considered acceptable.

Facebook defines seven types of "attacks" that it considers hate speech: calls for exclusion, calls for violence, calls for segregation, degrading generalization, dismissing, cursing and slurs.

For users who want to contest Facebook's rulings, the company offers little recourse. Users can provide feedback on decisions they don't like, but there is no formal appeals process.

Of the hundreds of readers who submitted posts to ProPublica, only one said Facebook reversed a decision in response to feedback. Grammy-winning musician Janis Ian was banned from posting on Facebook for several days for violating community standards after she posted a photo of a man with a swastika tattooed on the back of his head — even though the text overlaid on the photo urged people to speak out against a Nazi rally. Facebook also removed the post.

Warning: This image contains offensive material. Click to view.

A group of her fans protested her punishment, and some reached out to their contacts in Silicon Valley. Shortly afterwards, the company reversed itself, restoring the post and Ian's access. "A member of our team accidentally removed something you posted on Facebook," it wrote to Ian. "This was a mistake, and we sincerely apologize for this error. We've since restored the content, and you should now be able to see it."

"Here's the frustrating thing for me as someone who uses Facebook: when you try to find out what the community standards are, there's no place to go. They change them willy-nilly whenever there's controversy," Ian said. "They've made themselves so inaccessible."

Without an appeals process, some Facebook users have banded together to flag the same offensive posts repeatedly, in the hope that a higher volume of reports will finally reach a sympathetic moderator. Annie Ramsey, a feminist activist, founded a group called "Double Standards" to mobilize members against disturbing speech about women. Members post egregious examples to the private group, such as this image of a woman in a shopping cart, as if she were merchandise.

Warning: This image contains offensive material. Click to view.

Facebook's rules prohibit dehumanization and bullying. Ramsey's group repeatedly complained about the image but was told it didn't violate community standards.

When we brought this example to Facebook, the company defended its decision. Although its rules prohibit content that depicts, celebrates or jokes about non-consensual sexual touching, Facebook said, this image did not contain enough context to demonstrate non-consensual sexual touching.

Ramsey's group had more luck with another picture of a woman in a shopping cart, this time with the caption, "Returned my defective sandwich-maker to Wal-Mart." The group repeatedly flagged this post en masse, and eventually it got taken down. The difference may have been that the woman in this image was bloodied, suggesting she was the victim of a sexual assault. Facebook's guidelines call for removing images that mock the victims of rape or non-consensual sexual touching, hate crimes or other serious physical injuries, the spokesperson said.

Facebook said it takes steps to prevent mass reporting, a tactic used not only by "Double Standards" but by other advocacy groups, from influencing decisions. It uses automation to recognize duplicate reports, and caps the number of times it reviews a single post, according to a Facebook official.

Members of Ramsey's group have run afoul of Facebook's rules for what they consider candid discussion of gender issues. Facebook took down a post by one member, Charro Sebring, which said, "Men really are trash."

Facebook defended its decision to remove what it called a "gender-based attack."

Warning: This image contains offensive material. Click to view.

Facebook banned Ramsey herself from posting on Facebook for 30 days. Her offense was reposting a suggestive image on another Facebook user's page of a sleeping woman and a string of comments calling for rape. Ramsey added the caption: "Women don't make memes or comments like this #NameTheProblem"

Facebook restored Ramsey's post after ProPublica brought it to the company's attention. The content as a whole didn't violate the guidelines because the caption attached to the photo condemned sexual violence, the spokesperson said.

Facebook's about-face didn't mollify Ramsey. "They give you a little place to provide 'feedback' about your experience," she said. "I give feedback every time in capital letters: YOU'RE BANNING THE WRONG PEOPLE. It makes me want to shove my head into a wall."The National Post recently covered the CBC's cancellation of a BBC documentary about transgender children (Why CBC cancelled a BBC documentary that activists claimed was 'transphobic'). In that coverage, the Post shared claims made by some activists criticizing some scientific studies, but did not apparently fact-check those claims, so I thought I would outline the studies here. For reference, in a previous post, I listed the results of every study that ever followed up transgender kids to see how they felt in adulthood (Do trans- kids stay trans- when they grow up?). There are 12 such studies in all, and they all came to the very same conclusion: The majority of kids cease to feel transgender when they get older.

The Post conveyed criticisms alleged about two of those: "One study of Dutch children, in particular, assumed that subjects had 'desisted' purely because they stopped showing up to a gender identity clinic." Although unnamed, the claim appears to be referring to Steensma et al. (2013), which followed up on 127 transgender kids. Of them: 47 said they were still transgender; 56 said they were no longer transgender (46 said so directly, 6 said so via their parents, and 4 more said so despite not participating in other aspects of the study); and 24 did not respond to the invitation to participate in the study or could not be located. Because all the medical services for transition are free in the Netherlands and because there is only one clinic providing those services, the researchers were able to check that none of the 24 had actually transitioned despite having the opportunity to do so. Steensma therefore reported that (80/127 =) 63% of the cases desisted. The alleged criticism is that one should not assume that the 24 who did not respond or could not be found were desisters. Regardless of whether one agrees with that, the irrelevance of claim is clearly seen simply by taking it to its own conclusion: When one excludes these 24, one simply finds a desistance rate of (56/103 =) 54% instead of 63%. That is, although numerically lower, it nonetheless supports the very same conclusion as before. The majority of kids cease to feel transgender when they get older.

The other alleged criticism was that a study "cast too wide a net on which children were legitimately displaying gender dysphoria." Although also unnamed, this seems to refer to Drummond et al. (2008), which followed up 25 kids assessed in childhood for gender issues: 15 of the 25 received official diagnoses for their gender dysphoria, and 10 were judged to be experiencing the feelings, but to be "subthreshold" for an official diagnosis. That is, the alleged criticism is that including "subthreshold" cases would water down the results from cases who are formally diagnosed. The irrelevance of that claim is again easily seen by looking at it directly: Of the 15 kids who received a diagnosis, two continued to be transgender in adulthood (13/15 = 87% desistance), and of the 10 without a diagnosis, one continued to be transgender (9/10 = 90% desistance). Drummond thus reported their combination, that (22/25 =) 88% desisted. That is, both the "too wide" net and the narrow net each support the very same conclusion: The majority of kids cease to feel transgender when they get older.

I am personally of the opinion that the studies' authors were correct in their original methods, but the numbers indicate that it simply does not matter. Even if the criticisms were valid, the studies conclusions would remain the same.

The state of the science is made clear simply by listing the results of the studies on the topic. Despite coming from a variety of countries and from a variety of labs, using a variety of methods, all spanning four decades, every single study without exception has come to the identical conclusion. This is not a matter of scientists disagreeing with one another over relative strengths and weaknesses across a set of conflicting reports. The disagreement is not even some people advocating for one set of studies with other people advocating for different set of studies: Rather, activists are rejecting the unanimous conclusion of every single study ever conducted on the question in favour of a conclusion supported by not one.

Importantly, these results should not be exaggerated in the other direction either: The correct answer is neither 0% nor 100%. Although the majority of transgender kids desist, it is not a large majority. A very substantial proportion do indeed want to transition as they get older, and we need to ensure they receive the support they will need. Despite loud, confident protestations of extremists, the science shows very clearly and very consistently that we cannot take either outcome for granted.

This article was originally published at SexologyToday.orgMinnesota Vikings -11.5 vs. Chicago Bears

The Vikings need to win this game to secure the 2-seed in the NFC playoffs, and the Bears simply aren't in their league. Minnesota ranks 5th in total DVOA (7th on offense, 3rd on defense) compared to Chicago's 25th (27th on offense, 14th on defense), and the Bears have nothing to play for. The Vikings have won their last two home games against the Bears by scores of 38-10 and 38-17. Barring a truly bizarre turn of events, Mitch Trubisky will struggle and the Vikings will win convincingly. If I'm lucky, it will mean the end of the John Fox era!

Jacksonville Jaguars +3 at Tennessee Titans

Jacksonville is a hard team to evaluate heading into Week 17. They don't have anything to play for, but head coach Doug Marrone has suggested they won't be resting anyone. I don't blame him; I wouldn't want to head into the playoffs with consecutive losses to the 49ers and Titans, either. Tennessee is fighting to secure a Wild Card spot, but they simply aren't very good. They're currently ranked 19th in total DVOA and 22nd in weighted DVOA coming off of three consecutive losses. I can't believe I'm picking Blake Bortles two weeks in a row, but what can I say? This is 2017.

Houston Texans +6 at Indianapolis Colts

I don't really understand this line at all. Both teams are bad, but the Texans rate better in total DVOA (27th to 31st), offensive DVOA (25th to 29th) and defensive DVOA (20th to 27th). A three-point line for a game in Indianapolis would make sense, but 6? The Colts have only won one game by 6 points this year, and while it came against this Texans team, I'm willing to make an adjustment considering they'd just lost their Rookie of the Year candidate Deshaun Watson. I don't feel great picking Tom Savage, but no one should feel great picking the Colts.

New England Patriots -15 vs. New York Jets

New England has historically played well in Week 17 when there are playoff implications on the line, and there are some here as a loss coupled with a Pittsburgh win would drop them to the 2-seed. The Jets are considering trying out inexperienced quarterbacks, and while they've played better than most expected this season, they have no reason to go all out in this game. The only risk I see is the Patriots jumping out to a huge lead in the first half and letting the Jets cover on the back end, but I have faith in Tom Brady and Bill Belichick to keep the game out of reach.

Carolina Panthers +3.5 at Atlanta Falcons

The NFC playoff picture is murky, but I think the Panthers still have an outside chance at securing the 2-seed. They'll definitely have some motivation to play hard this week, and the Falcons will need to put it together on offense to come away with a win. They've shown flashes all year, but haven't been able to consistently score points against competent defenses. Carolina certainly qualifies, with the 8th-ranked defense by DVOA and top-ranked pass rush. The Panthers have won ugly much of this year, but they've won 11 games. Cam Newton should be able to get them to 12 against the Falcons' 23rd-ranked defense.

New Orleans Saints -6.5 at Tampa Bay Buccaneers

I think Tampa Bay is terrible, and the stats back me up. The Buccaneers rank 22nd in total DVOA and a putrid 31st in defensive DVOA heading into this matchup with the Saints. New Orleans has also won 3 of the past 4 matchups with Tampa by a touchdown or more, including this year's 30-10 Week 8 beatdown. New Orleans needs to win to secure the NFC North title, so we can expect them to play their starters. Let's see what Drew Brees and Sean Payton can do to tie a bow on a bounceback 2017 season.

Washington Snyders -3 at New York Giants

I'm not terribly excited to be picking this game because neither team has anything to play for. Still, Washington is ranked 13th in total DVOA while the Giants are ranked 30th, and New York is talking about getting reps for their backups. The Giants simply aren't equipped to take advantage of Washington's weaknesses; their 29th-ranked rushing offense won't bludgeon Washington's 26th-ranked rushing defense, their 24th-ranked rushing defense won't stonewall Washington's 28th-ranked rushing offense, and their 29th-ranked pass rush won't harry Washington's 22nd-ranked pass protection. The Giants even have more to gain with a loss in terms of draft positioning. I expect the Snyders to win handily and face an offseason of Kirk Cousins' contract questions.

Pittsburgh Steelers -6 vs. Cleveland Browns

As I mentioned in the New England pick above, the Steelers still have a chance at the 1-seed in the AFC. They might fold up shop early if they see the Patriots out to a big lead, but do we have any reason to believe that will let Cleveland make the game close? The Browns are playing to avoid the ignominy of being the second-ever 0-16 team and nothing else. They rank dead last in total DVOA and offensive DVOA, and the game is being played in Pittsburgh. Even with Antonio Brown sitting out, the Steelers should win by a landslide. Granted, they've underwhelmed against bad teams in the past, but they have a bye week to look forward to after this game.

Los Angeles Rams +4.5 vs. San Francisco 49ers

The Jimmy G hype train is ready to jump its tracks, and this week could be a perfect opportunity. The Rams are resting their best players, but they're also playing at home with good line play on both sides of the ball. Sometimes a team just has things rolling, and I can see the Rams coming away with a meaningless win here against a San Francisco team that has shown some encouraging flashes but still ranks 21st in weighted DVOA. One win over Blake Bortles isn't enough to make me think they've arrived as a team.

This website Copyright © 2002-2019. All Rights Reserved.Former CIA agent John Sipher told MSNBC on Saturday that President Donald Trump and his Fox News enablers are functioning like Iranian government propagandists in their desire to create straw man enemies against which to pitch their base.

Regarding Trump's attacks on the FBI, Sipher said, "I find those kind of statements shameful, frankly. Our public servants, they take an oath to the Constitution and they work for Democratic and Republican presidential administrations."

"People like the president and members of Congress and Senators, when they speak, they're speaking to numerous audiences. They're speaking to foreign audiences who are listening closely," Sipher said. "They're speaking as the head of the government to all the people who work for them."

However, he said, Trump and people like Rep. Francis Rooney (R-FL) — who called for a "purge" of personnel from the FBI last week — are "speaking to a small base of people who want, just like the Iranians do, to create a straw man enemy."

"They've tried to suggest that the FBI, CIA and the Justice Department somehow are an enemy of the administration and therefore need to be taken down," he said. "That's just nonsense, is what that is."

Thank you, so much. You made me smile a lot!!! Happy New Year!!!Vaya uno a saber por donde pasa el secreto pero algo hay en la tierra de este país. El interminable surgimiento de futbolistas lleva a pensar al mundo entero. Nadie se explica cómo en un pequeño territorio habitado por 3,5 millones de personas, siguen surgiendo futbolistas con talento. Algunos lo tildan de milagro. Otros hablan de la historia. Hay quienes lo atribuyen a lo competitivo que son los uruguayos desde temprana edad.



Lo cierto y real es que la materia prima del Uruguay sigue siendo un producto de interés en el exterior.



La prueba más contundente es que cada año emigra un promedio de un centenar de futbolistas. A modo de ejemplo, en 2015 se fueron 98 jugadores, el año pasado partieron 108 profesionales y, llegando al fin de 2017 salieron 107 futbolistas. Esto marca que se fueron al exterior 9,7 equipos. Más de la mitad de los clubes que compiten en la primera división del Campeonato Uruguayo.



Y cada año sorprende la cantidad de jugadores jóvenes que son llevados por equipos de todas partes del mundo. Siguiendo la lógica de que el listón en el baby fútbol va cada vez más arriba y hoy no sorprende que un niño de 10 años tenga representante, se podrán imaginar que a nivel juvenil se llevan a los cracks del futuro como pan caliente.



Y desde mercados inusuales como el chico Lucas Riveiro que, con 17 años, partió de Cerro para jugar en el FK Wien de Austria.



Las apuestas son permanentes. Algunos ni siquiera alcanzan a debutar en Primera División en sus equipos cuando ya emigraron.



A modo de ejemplo Agustín Dávila, un sub 18 de Peñarol, partió a jugar a Real Sociedad de España. Otro tanto ocurrió con los juveniles de Nacional, Maximiliano Villa y Andrés Romero (hermano del Colo) que emigraron a Girona de España.



Sub 20 barrida

Se podría decir que el año futbolístico quedó marcado por dos hechos: la clasificación de Uruguay a Rusia 2018 y la consagración de la sub 20 en el Sudamericano de Quito.



Entonces, como era de esperar, la selección juvenil fue vaciada. Al menos nueve jugadores del plantel que condujo técnicamente Fabián Coito emigraron al exterior.



De aquel equipo se fueron: Santiago Bueno, Federico Valverde, Rodrigo Amaral, Nicolás De la Cruz, Diego Rossi, Santiago Mele, Marcelo Saracchi, Joaquín Ardaiz y Mathías Olivera.



El pase más resonante fue el del defensa Santiago Bueno. Barcelona de España lo venía siguiendo desde hace unos años y tras el Sudamericano juvenil se lo llevaron pese a que arrancó de titular pero perdió el puesto con Mathías Viña. Eso sí, en el Mundial de Corea del Sur fue gran figura. Actualmente milita en la filial del club catalán a la espera de su debut en el primer equipo.



Su transferencia generó controversias en Peñarol por el monto final de la operación y el dinero que ingreso a las arcas de la institución: € 1,5 millones por el 70% de la ficha.



Pase récord

Nicolás De la Cruz se transformó en el pase más caro de la historia de Liverpool. El volante emigró a River Plate de Argentina que compró el 25 % de su ficha a cambio de US$ 3,5 millones y priorizó quedarse en el continente ya que fue padre.



Tres integrantes de aquella selección juvenil fueron objeto de curiosos negocios.



El delantero Joaquín Ardaiz, surgido en las formativas de Danubio, fue adquirido por un grupo británico que lo inscribió en El Tanque Sisley que a su vez lo cedió seis meses más a Danubio.



Luego del Mundial sub 20 desapareció. Se fue de viaje a Europa hasta que sus representantes lo colocaron en un club de Bélgica.



Mathías Olivera fue sacado de Nacional por Daniel Fonseca, fichó por Atenas donde no jugó y terminó en Europa (Getafe) colocado por otro empresario.



Pero acaso el pase más mediático de un integrante de aquel plantel fue el de Rodrigo Amaral que fue sacado de Nacional por Daniel Fonseca y al final terminó en Racing de Avellaneda.



Cosa de grandes

Entre los mayores los pases más destacados fueron los de Maximiliano Gómez de Defensor Sporting a Celta y Nahitan Nandez que emigró de Peñarol a Boca Juniors.



En materia de mercados hay de todo. Acaso lo menos habituales hacia donde este año partieron jugadores fueron Malta, Noruega y Hungría.



Uruguay ratificó que es un gran exportador de materia prima y que la generación de talentos es la principal vía de los equipos para sostener sus estructuras.



Las cifras

107 jugadores uruguayos emigraron a lo largo del año 2017. Apenas uno menos que el año anterior.

9,7 promedio de equipos se pueden armar con semejante éxodo.

17 Peñarol es el club desde donde más jugadores partieron al exterior con 17 profesionales. Algunos de ellos productos genuinos de su cantera como Nahitan Nandez, Santiago Bueno, Diego Rossi, Fabricio Buschiazzo, Miguel Merentiel, Martín Chaves, Agustín Dávila, Federico Antúnez o Facundo Rodríguez, y otros que pasaron por el club pero no logaron afirmarse como Maximiliano Perg, Mauricio Affonso, Nicolás Dibble, Junior Arias, Matías Mier, Nicolás Albarracín, Hernán Novick y Damián Frascarelli.

Según pasan los años

2008, 128 pases. Comenzaron a salir jugadores juveniles que ni siquiera habían debutado en Primera como Diego Polenta, Enzo Barroti, Jonathan Píriz o Matías Massiero.

2009, 107 pases. Aquel año el campeonato Uruguayo se quedó sin Abel Hernández, Carlos Bueno, Henry Giménez, Mauricio Victorino, Joaquín Boghossian y William Ferreira, entre otros.

2010, 110 pases. Fue el año en que el gobierno comenzó a mirar con otros ojos el tema de los pases y surgió la inquietud de que los clubes debían percibir más dinero que los intermediarios.

2011, 125 pases. El éxodo no se detuvo y partieron 125 jugadores. Referí reveló que desde 2000 a 2011 se habían ido al exterior 1.539 futbolistas, es decir, el equivalente a 139 equipos.

2012, 138 pases. Fue una temporada impresionante en materia de salidas. Los destacados: Aguirregaray, Rolín, Goicoechea, MacEachen, Nico Olivera, Alcoba, Alfaro y Rodrigo Muñoz, entre otros.

2013, 74 pases. Disminuyó bastante la cifra de jugadores uruguayos que partieron al exterior. Los pases más salientes fueron los de Matías Cabrera, Diego Rolan y Gonzalo Bueno.

2014, 75 pases. Se mantuvo el promedio de salidas con relación al año anterior. Danubio perdió piezas claves como Emiliano Velázquez, Jonathan Álvez y Bruno Fornaroli.

- Mentre il governo reagisce alle proteste della popolazione con il "pugno di ferro", oscurando i social network e arrestando oggi cento persone ad Arak (15 agenti sono rimasti feriti) e duecento persone sabato, il presidente dell'Iran (alla guida del Paese dal 2013 e rieletto quest'anno),, apre. E difende il diritto di protesta. "La gente - ha dichiarato Rouhani - ha diritto di protestare, serve uno spazio per la critica". Il presidente iraniano nel suo discorso ha fatto una importante presa d'atto che suona quasi come monito rivolto all'attuale esecutivo: ha ammesso infatti che le proteste, nate inizialmente come reazione alla crisi economica, hanno poi preso di mira la corruzione e la scarsa trasparenza del governo.La crisi iraniana ha visto per la prima volta l'intervento del presidente clerico moderato, Harran Rohani, da quando sono scoppiati giovedì le proteste per il malcontento legato alla situazione economica del Paese, represse nel sangue e con arresti arbitrati. "La critica è diversa dalla violenza e dalla distruzione della proprietà pubblica" ha poi detto il presidente iraniano. "Le autorità - ha aggiunto - devono autorizzare le manifestazioni e le proteste legali". Rouhani ha cercato, come un equilibrista, di condannare la repressione dei manifestanti e di condannare il tentativo del presidente Usa,, di cavalcare la protesta. Il presidente ha quindi ordinato alle diverse branche del governo, a partire dalle forze dell'ordine (inclusi i paramilitari Basiji ai Pasdaran) di lasciare "spazio al dissenso".Nei giorni scorsi in molte manifestazioni pubbliche soprattutto nel Nord del Paese sono state rivolte invettive contro l'establishment religioso dell'Iran, i cui vertici sono stati accusati senza mezzi termini di essersi arricchiti mentre la popolazione vive di stenti.La fine delle sanzioni, dopo l'accordo sul nucleare del 2015 - nonostante la recente marcia indietro di Trump - non sembra aver determinato una ripresa nel tenore di vita della popolazione, anche in ragione dell'aumento delle spese militari. Il malcontento per il ferreo controllo del regime su tutti gli aspetti della vita sociale è particolarmente diffuso tra i giovani. Al momento nè il numero uno della Repubblica islamica, la Guida suprema Ali Khamenei, nè il presidente, Hassan Rohani, hanno preso posizione ufficialmente sulle proteste, ma il ministro dell'Interno, Abdolrahman Rahmani Fazli, ha minacciato che gli autori delle violenze e i responsabili dell'ondata di disordini "pagheranno il prezzo" delle loro azioni. "Quanti danneggiano beni pubblici, creano disordine e infrangono la legge devono rispondere delle loro azioni e pagarne il prezzo", ha avvertito, "agiremo contro le violenze e contro quanti stanno seminando paura e terrore".

Rouhani ha replicato a Trump accusandolo di non aver interesse nel destino del popolo iraniano ma di puntare solo a sfruttare i problemi di Teheran. Trump, è l'affondo del presidente, "non ha alcun diritto" di simpatizzare con quegli iraniani che prima ha chiato "terroristi": Questo uomo oggi vuole simpatizzare con la nostra gente dimenticando che pochi mesi fa ha chiamato l'Iran "nazione di terroristi". "Questa persona che è totalmente contro l'Itan come nazione non ha alcun diritto di provare compassione per il popolo iraniano".Due morti (ma secondo alcuni fonti potrebbero essere sei), e duecento arresti negli scontri avvenuti ieri sera nella città di Doraud, nell'ovest dell'Iran. Mentre la comunità politica internazionale segue con preoccupazione l'escalation della violenza contro i manifestanti, eammonisce con un tweet "Il mondo vi guarda", continua la repressione del governo. La propaganda governativa respinge le accuse di aver aperto il fuoco e, per voce del vicegovernatore della provincia di Lorestan, accusa genericamente "estremisti sunniti e potenze straniere"."Sabato sera c'è stata una protesta illegale e diverse persone sono scese in strada rispondendo all'appello di gruppi ostili, che hanno portato a scontri sfortunatamente in questi scontri due cittadini di Doraud sono rimasti uccisi", è la versione di Habibollah Khojastehpour alla televisione di Stato.Il vicegovernatore ha ribadito che le forze di sicurezza non hanno sparato sulla folla: "In questi scontri, non un proiettile è stato esploso dalla polizia, dall'esercito o dalle forze di sicurezza contro le persone. L'obiettivo era che le proteste finissero in modo pacifico, ma a causa della presenza di alcune persone e di determinati gruppi, sfortunatamente è accaduto questo che ha portato all'uccisione di due persone".Secondo la versione dei Guardiani della rivoluzione la colpa dei morti sarebbe di non meglio identificati "gruppi ostili". "Persone munite di armi da caccia e da guerra si sono mischiate nelle proteste e hanno cominciato a sparare a caso tra la folla e contro l'edificio del governatore", uccidendo due persone e ferendone altre sei.Il ministro dell'Interno iraniano Abdolrahman Rahmani Fazli prima annuncia il pugno di ferro contro quanti "ricorrono alla violenza e creano disordini", dichiarando che ne "pagheranno il prezzo". Poi, però, blocca Instagram e Telegram che sono i social utilizzati pacificamente dai manifestanti iraniani per diffondere il loro dissenso e non certo perLe autorità iraniane hanno deciso una dura repressione contro la pacifica protesta della popolazione iraniana, stremata dalla crisi economica, dal carovita e dall'inflazione (i primi dispordini sono nati come reazione all'aumento del prezzo delle uova). Per cominciare hanno voluto tagliare i mezzi di comunicazione varando una serie di misure restrittive nell'accesso ai social media del Paese. Da qualche ora sia Telegram che Instagram risultano bloccati nell'accesso da cellulare.Secondo il ministero dell'Interno, Telegram in particolare sarebbe utilizzato da "gruppi controrivoluzionari sostenuti dall'estero" per lanciare appelli per l'uso di molotov e armi da fuoco nelle proteste di piazza. In mattinata il fondatore di Telegram, Pavel Durov, ha confermato con un tweet che l'app di messaggistica è stata bloccata nel Paese: "Le autorità iraniane hanno bloccato l'accesso a Telegram per la maggioranza degli iraniani nonostante il nostro rifiuto". La tv di Stato di Teheran ha replicato al tweet di Durov affermando che "Instagram e Telegram sono stati bloccati per mantenere la pace durante le proteste".Stando ai video pubblicati sui social network, manifestazioni di protesta si sono svolte in molte città del paese.CARACAS (Reuters) - A former oil minister excoriated Venezuelan President NicolasMaduro in a newspaper column on Sunday, accusing the leftist leader of behaving like biblical King Herod and plunging the oil-rich nation into economic devastation.

Rafael Ramirez, who was the all-powerful head of the oil ministry and state energy company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] for a decade, has long been a rival of Maduro.

In recent months, Ramirez has grown increasingly critical of Maduro's handling of a fourth straight year of recession that has triggered malnutrition, widespread food and medicine shortages, the world's steepest inflation, and a surge in emigration.

A furious Maduro ordered Ramirez to resign as the nation's United Nations ambassador in New York last month after an article entitled the "The Storm" was perceived as an attack on his government.

Ramirez fled the United States in December for an undisclosed location before Venezuela's state prosecutor accused him of corruption during the time he commanded the world's largest crude reserves.

In his sharpest critique to date, Ramirez on Sunday published a 3,000-word column in local newspaper Panorama, comparing Maduro to Herod, the Roman-appointed king of Judea who was accused of mass infanticide.

"You are killing the revolution," Ramirez wrote, without using Maduro's name.

"With a mix of arrogance, ignorance, incompetence, cynicism, and a lot of irresponsibility, you have brought our people to an unimaginable level of suffering and humiliation," he added, also accusing Maduro's inner circle of corruption and authoritarianism.

"If our Commander (late leader Hugo Chavez) were with us, standing in line for food, or walking the streets of Caracas seeing children looking through garbage, what would he do? And what would you tell him?"

The government did not respond to a request for comment about the article.

The political opposition says Ramirez is a hypocrite who is also responsible for Venezuela's economic meltdown. They say he destroyed PDVSA by filling the company's roster with political loyalists and letting at least $11 billion go "missing" during his tenure.

Insiders say accusations against Ramirez stem from a turf war among ruling Socialists, especially ahead of next year's presidential election, rather than a real desire to root out graft.

In recent months authorities have spearheaded an anti-graft purge of the oil sector, jailing 69 top managers including two former oil ministers. Critics say the arrests are designed to consolidate the unpopular Maduro's control of the industry which brings in over 90 percent of foreign currency.

In the latest development, anti-government union leader Ivan Freites, who frequently gave information about problems at Venezuela's ailing refineries, said on Twitter over the weekend he had been summoned by intelligence agents. Political sources said he had left the country.

Reuters was unable to verify the information or contact Freites.

In his article, Ramirez urged top government officials to speak out against Maduro's purge before it is too late. "Today it's me, tomorrow it will be you," Ramirez wrote.Iran's President Hassan Rouhani delivers remarks at a news conference during the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, U.S. September 20, 2017.

LONDON (Reuters) - President Hassan Rouhani, giving his first public reaction to four days of anti-government protests, said on Sunday Iranians had the right to protest and criticize the authorities but their actions should not lead to violence or damage public property.

"People are absolutely free to criticize the government and protest but their protests should be in such a way as to improve the situation in the country and their life," Rouhani was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as telling the cabinet.

"Criticism is different from violence and damaging public properties."

Anti-government protesters demonstrated on Sunday in defiance of a warning by the authorities of a tough crackdown, extending for a fourth day one of the most audacious challenges to the clerical leadership since pro-reform unrest in 2009.

Tens of thousands of people have protested across the country since Thursday against the Islamic Republic's unelected clerical elite and Iranian foreign policy in the region. They have also chanted slogans in support of political prisoners.

"Resolving the problems is not easy and would take time. The government and people should help each other to resolve the issues," Rouhani said, according to IRNA.

Rouhani also rebuffed U.S. President Donald Trump's comments in support of the protests.

"This man in America who is sympathizing today with our people has forgotten that he called the Iranian nation terrorists a few months ago. This man who is against the Iranian nation to his core has no right to sympathize with Iranians," Rouhani said.DENVER (Reuters) - A gunman opened fire on sheriff's deputies at an apartment complex near Denver on Sunday, killing one officer before the suspect was shot and killed, the Douglas County Sheriff's Office said.

Four other deputies and two civilians were shot and wounded by the suspect, identified as 37-year-old Matthew Riehl, who had had numerous run-ins with the law, according to Sheriff Tony Spurlock.

It was not immediately clear why the incident had escalated, Spurlock said.

"All of them were shot very, very quickly and they all went down almost within seconds of each other," Spurlock told reporters at a news conference, calling it an "ambush-type" attack.

President Donald Trump said on Twitter: "My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @dcsheriff, and their families."

The deputies first responded to a "verbal disturbance" at the apartment complex in Highland Ranch, about 16 miles (26 km) south of Denver, at about 3 a.m., the sheriff's office said in a statement.

Two men were in the apartment, and one of them told the officers that the other was "acting bizarre and may be having a mental breakdown," the statement said. The officers left the scene after determining no crime had been committed.

About 5:15 a.m., officers returned after a second complaint. After they entered the residence, the suspect opened fire from a bedroom, killing Deputy Zackari Parrish, 29, and wounding three others.

Parrish, who was married with two young children, had joined the force seven months earlier.

"When he was shot and went down, the other officers went down right around him and they tried to pull him out, but were unable to because of their injuries," Spurlock said.

At about 7 a.m., a SWAT team entered the apartment and more shots were exchanged. Riehl was killed and a fourth officer was wounded.

All told, Riehl fired more than 100 rounds before he was shot by police.

The injured officers were identified as Mike Doyle, 28; Taylor Davis, 30; Jeffrey Pelle, 32, and Tom O'Donnell 31. They were taken to hospital and were in stable condition.

Pelle, who had emergency surgery, is the son of Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle, according to an online statement from the family.

The identities of the two injured civilians were not immediately disclosed, but Spurlock said he believed they are residents from other apartments. Their injuries were not life- threatening, he said.

The housing complex in an affluent suburban community near Littleton is described on its website as "one of the friendliest apartments" in the area.DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian protesters attacked police stations late into the night on Monday, news agency and social media reports said, as security forces struggled to contain the boldest challenge to the clerical leadership since unrest in 2009.

Videos on social media showed an intense clash in the central town of Qahderijan between security forces and protesters who were trying to occupy a police station, which was partially set ablaze. There were unconfirmed reports of several casualties among demonstrators.

In the western city of Kermanshah, protesters set fire to a traffic police post, but no one was hurt in the incident, Mehr news agency said.

Demonstrations continued for a fifth day. Some 13 people were reported killed on Sunday in the worst wave of unrest since crowds took to the streets in 2009 to condemn the re-election of then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

The protests have put pressure on the clerical leaders in power since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. President Hassan Rouhani made a televised call for calm on Sunday, saying Iranians had the right to criticize but must not cause unrest.

In the central city of Najafabad, a demonstrator opened fire on police with a hunting rifle, killing one and wounding three others, state television said.

Earlier, state TV said armed demonstrators on Sunday had tried to seize police and military bases but were stopped by "strong resistance from security forces." It gave no further details and there was no independent confirmation.

State TV had reported that 10 people were killed in protests on Sunday. On Monday, that death toll rose when the deputy governor of the western Hamadan Province, Saeed Shahrokhi, told ISNA news agency that another three protesters were killed on Sunday in the city of Tuyserkan.

"NO TOLERANCE"

Hundreds have been arrested, according to officials and social media. Online video showed police in the capital Tehran firing water cannon to disperse demonstrators, in footage said to have been filmed on Sunday.

Protests against economic hardships and alleged corruption erupted in Iran's second city of Mashhad on Thursday and escalated across the country into calls for the religious establishment to step down.

Some of the anger was directed at Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, breaking a taboo surrounding the man who has been supreme leader of Iran since 1989.

Video posted on social media showed crowds of people walking through the streets, some chanting "Death to the dictator!" Reuters was not immediately able to verify the footage. The Fars news agency reported "scattered groups" of protesters in Tehran on Monday and said a ringleader had been arrested.

"The government will show no tolerance for those who damage public property, violate public order and create unrest in society," Rouhani said in his address on Sunday.

Unsigned statements on social media urged Iranians to continue to demonstrate in 50 towns and cities.

The government said it was temporarily restricting access to the Telegram messaging app and Instagram. There were reports that internet mobile access was blocked in some areas.

Iran is a major OPEC oil producer and regional power deeply involved in Syria and Iraq as part of a battle for influence with rival Saudi Arabia. Many Iranians resent those foreign interventions, and want their leaders to create jobs at home, where youth unemployment reached 28.8 percent last year.

Among reported fatalities, two people were shot dead in the southwestern town of Izeh on Sunday and several others were injured, ILNA news agency quoted a member of parliament as saying.

"I do not know whether yesterday's shooting was done by rally participants or the police and this issue is being investigated," Hedayatollah Khademi was quoted as saying.

Regional governor Mostafa Samali told Fars that only one person was killed in an incident unrelated to the protests, and the suspected shooter had been arrested.

Almost nine years since the "Green movement" reformist protests were crushed by the state, Iran's adversaries voiced their support for the resurgence of anti-government sentiment.

U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted: "The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!"

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the "brave Iranians" taking to streets to protest a regime that "wastes tens of billions of dollars spreading hate".

German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel urged "all sides (to) refrain from violent actions".WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump's administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban.

Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration's request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1.

A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings.

"The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD's study and will continue to defend the president's lawful authority in District Court in the meantime," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump.

Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen.

Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: "As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards."

Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal "great news."

"I'm hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it's not good for the military or our country," Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration.

"COSTS AND DISRUPTION"

In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama's policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military "cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail."

Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump's ban while legal challenges to the Republican president's policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law.

The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants' sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear.

Slideshow (2 Images)

The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept "some individuals who are not medically fit for service."

The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump's defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president's ban then put off indefinitely.

Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.Afghan police officers inspect the site of a suicide attack on the outskirts of Jalalabad, Afghanistan December 31, 2017.REUTERS/Parwiz

JALALABAD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - A suicide attack at a funeral in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad on Sunday killed at least 15 people and wounded 13, the governor's spokesman said.

Attaullah Khogyani, spokesman for the provincial governor, said the attacker had blown himself up as people gathered for the funeral of a former district governor at a cemetery in the city.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, which comes days after at least 41 people were killed and more than 80 wounded in a suicide attack on a Shi'ite cultural center in Kabul on Thursday.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, one of the worst in the Afghan capital in months.

CARSON, Calif. — Michael Crabtree has spent his nine-year NFL career in the Bay Area.

He might have to depart the region for that career to continue.

The Raiders are expected to move on from their wide receiver this offseason. There has been a measure of dysfunction behind the scenes of a 6-9 campaign that will conclude Sunday at the Los Angeles Chargers. Changes are coming, and sources have indicated those will include parting with a player whose production is not considered worth the baggage.

The move makes financial sense, too.

Crabtree is owed a $7 million salary in 2018, the third season of a four-year, $34 million extension he signed late in 2015. No dead money against the salary cap will accompany his anticipated release, given that extension included no signing bonus or guarantees in the deal's second half. He turns 31 next September.

In 2009, the Texas Tech product was the No. 10 overall draft pick by San Francisco. He spent six seasons with the 49ers before moving across the Bay, signing a one-year deal with the Raiders. He quickly demonstrated his worth, earning an extension in December of his first season.

Crabtree caught 85 passes for 922 yards and nine touchdowns in 2015. He improved last season with with 89 catches for 1,003 yards and eight scores.

In 2017, the Raiders' offensive production has been down across the board. To his credit, Crabtree has provided some bright moments. He caught six touchdowns in the first six games, including a 2-yard reception for the game-winning score with no time remaining in a 31-30 win over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 6.

Production has settled of late. He ran five routes in Week 12 before being ejected for a tussle involving Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib. The NFL determined that Crabtree punched cornerback Chris Harris Jr. on the preceding play, too, when levying a two-game suspension. Crabtree won an appeal to cut the suspension in half.

During the three games since, he has caught 14 of 33 passes for 99 yards and two touchdowns. He was held catchless on two targets in last Monday's 19-10 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.

His snap count was limited in the fourth quarter amid a hamstring injury, coach Jack Del Rio said. Crabtree was not listed on the injury report this week leading up to Sunday's finale at StubHub Center.

He entered this weekend with 56 receptions for 601 yards and eight touchdowns.

During their first meeting of 2018, Clark County commissioners will ease their way into the year with a relatively light agenda highlighted by bollards.

The commission on Tuesday will consider approving the installation of another 500 steel posts between the street and sidewalks along the Strip to improve pedestrian safety. The posts would be placed between Tropicana Avenue and Spring Mountain Road.

Muller Construction, which finished installing close to 800 posts along the Strip in December, would be paid an additional $2.5 million for the new work.

The bollards are 15 to 18 inches beneath the ground and anchored by interconnected, underground steel frames. The posts are about 4 feet tall and strong enough to stop a flatbed truck traveling 55 mph, county staff has said.

Altogether, the posts will shield about 3,200 feet of sidewalk.

County commissioners also are scheduled to consider:

— Ratifying the appointment of Anna Danchik as county comptroller

— Eliminating the county's mail ballot precincts

— Relocating the county's juvenile assessment center, The Harbor, to 861 N. Mojave Road, Las Vegas

— Entering a $9.57 million contract with Cobblestone Construction to remodel parts of McCarran International Airport

In 2018 they will pay $13,968, which increases that threshold to over $160,000.

For the same couple in 14 Nevada counties including Churchill, the cost is $23,856 annually! They could earn between $64,000 and $295,000 and still be exempt from the fine. And adding another layer of insult, the Bronze plans are narrow network, high deductible, in-state-only HMOs. Folks in Nevada who pay 100 percent of their premium don't want an HMO; in fact, we go elsewhere for serious medical conditions, so we need a nationwide PPO. Families who live in border areas want to go to Salt Lake, Phoenix, Boise and San Francisco.

The major medical plans available in Nevada are ridiculously expensive, have extremely narrow networks, have little or no choice, and they may not even save your life. If you cannot go to the Mayo Clinic, UCLA Medical Center or other national facilities, you are endangering your family.

There is a common joke in Las Vegas that now aptly applies to all our state: Where do people in Nevada go when they are sick? The airport. Worst of all, now there are families who cannot afford the premium and are without any medical coverage. Great stewardship to the officials and so-called policy experts in Nevada.

Consult your tax adviser and make certain you did not pay a fine in past years for not having Obamacare if you were actually exempt, or if you would have planned differently based on this information available since 2010. Forbes Magazine, eHealth, Yahoo Finance and Business Wire, among other outlets, have reported that Obamacare premiums nationally would be unaffordable to most consumers not eligible for a subsidy in 2018. This is especially true in Nevada.

There are many alternatives to Obamacare, including medical sharing plans, so you don't have to go without medical insurance, and it really is affordable.

Glad you asked! Preserving I use casting as normal. For defiling, apply defiling effect and roll a d20 after casting. 11+, spell slot is kept and can be reused. Designed to make it VERY tempting to players... https://t.co/SbwgdsiirY — Mike Mearls (@mikemearls) November 26, 2017

Keep in mind that this assumes you're running a campaign where defiling is literally a kill on site offense for the staggering majority of the Athasian population. — Mike Mearls (@mikemearls) November 26, 2017

Would also assume that most populations have means of reliably killing a powerful defiler mage. Often I find that the only way for normal people to contest even mid-level mages (even without infinite spell slots!) is to overwhelm with numbers, knowing that 80% of them will die.Since everyone on Athas is psionic, that helps seriously even the odds. One person in the crowd with the right power can overwhelm a mage — Mike Mearls (@mikemearls) November 26, 2017

Speaking of which: At this point, how would you do Wild Talents? Just a talent (psionic cantrip)? Access to a discipline with a couple (2) power points and a talent? Something else entirely maybe?

Would you use the two method of gathering spell energy through defiling magic? Or simply gathering energy when the spell is cast? I'd use it when casting — Mike Mearls (@mikemearls) January 13, 2018Thank Obama policies for prosperous 2017

Re "Middle class got some good news in 2017" (Dec. 24): Other than stock prices, any good economic news in 2017 accrues to the momentum of Obama-era policies, not cuts in regulations or taxes that haven't set in yet.

Old rubric about corporate income taxes was corporations don't pay them, consumers do. So one test for AT&T will be if it now lowers prices. Its rate for my cable/land line just went up, so I'm a skeptic.

American companies were already sitting on a $2.3 trillion cash hoard. Hard to see how giving them more cash will set off a frenzy of new investing. I do hear spending on robotics is up, which won't help the middle class long term. And what ever happened to paying for tax cuts by closing corporate loopholes?

Burt Smith ("Trump's first year shows he's winning" Dec. 24) cites "facts in a nutshell" in praising Trump's 3.3 percent economic growth and Barack Obama's was never higher than 1.4 percent. Not so. Except for 2009, the first year of the Obama administration, where GDP shrunk by 2.8%, continuing the economic slide from the Bush Administration, the Obama Administration's annual GDP growth averaged 2.1 percent and never was lower than 1.6 percent.

Smith also writes, "...manufacturing jobs surging with sector unemployment at 2.6 percent", but Trump inherited a manufacturing unemployment rate of 3.9 percent when he was elected.

Actually, overall job growth under President Trump from February to August of this year (1,189,000 jobs) lags the number of jobs created under the Obama administration for the same period in 2016 (1,422,000 jobs).

Trump may not get enough credit for the economy's performance, but he continues to argue that he hit a home run when, in reality, he started out at third base.

昨年12月、宮司の女性が刺殺された東京都江東区の富岡八幡宮では、1月1日午前零時を迎える直前に参拝客が次々と訪れた。

1日を迎えるまでは、参拝客は少なかった。毎年、富岡八幡宮で屋台を出店している50代の男性は「売り上げに影響しそう」とぼやいていた。別の出店の男性も「どう考えても今年は縁起が悪い。いつも顔を見せてくれる地元の人がまだあまり来ていない。これじゃ、初詣も期待できないだろう」と話していたが、1日午前零時の直前には、本殿まで行列ができた。

福岡市から参拝に来た主婦の女性(69)は「これまで、富岡八幡宮には孫の七五三や参拝でお世話になった。習慣になっているから、今日は参拝したい。事件と神様は別だと考えることにした」と話していた。We were so swept up in praising ourselves for all the gains made in the independent realm of country music in 2017, it wasn't until here in the dwindling moments of the year that we realized just what a dreadful era 2017 posed in the mainstream. Not just from the lack of quality on the upside, but the redefining of the absolute bottom from the downside, it is definitely worth considering 2017 as the worst year in mainstream country music history, and after a few years of of very substantial and measurable gains.

The worst country albums of 2017 most certainly reflect that.

Brantley Gilbert – The Devil Don't Sleep

Brantley Gilbert is the Godfather of Bro-Country, the Master of Rural Machismo. And now after those who rode the Bro-Country wave to stardom are left wondering what is next, and looking quite awkward as they try their hands at something more meaningful, Brantley Gilbert isn't just doubling down, he's puffing his chest out and digging deeper into the well of cliché and self-ingratiating affirmation than ever before, flipping the bird at detractors.

He's a roided-out, tatted-up, tribal Tap-Out truck-nutted horn-flashing Jesus-praising meat head who makes no apologies for himself and has built an entire army of fans that are just as hard headed and proud, and will follow Brantley over a bridge if asked. The Devil Don't Sleep is the name of Brantley Gilbert's latest record, and for 15 of the 16 tracks, Brantley doesn't sleep either. There is no let up, no quarter given to the onslaught on your earholes and inner psyche by Gatling gun rock guitars screaming wildly over waves upon waves of bellicose, testosterone-pumped, carnal yawps about how totally cool and incredibly badass Brantley Gilbert and his compadres are.

Thomas Rhett – Life Changes

Thomas Rhett's got nothing. Each performing artist has at least one thing they can hang their hat on that makes them unique and interesting in the entertainment marketplace. Maybe they're a horrible songwriter, but a great singer. Maybe they have an interesting persona, or are physically attractive. Perhaps they don't have a whole lot of musical skill, but they can dance (here's looking at you Luke Bryan).

But with Thomas Rhett, it's none of the above. Yet that's his market advantage against the rest of the field, believe it or not. His malleable, indistinguishable nothingness makes him the perfect palette for Music Row producers to do their worst, and make Rhett into whatever money-making machination they wish without being inhibited by ulterior plans or desires harbored by Rhett. Thomas Rhett—weak willed and woefully untalented—is more than willing to succumb to whatever makeovers or styling requests the Nashville puppetmasters may bring to the table.

Rhett's superpower is complete and total subservience to the image consultants and money changers, without an iota of resistance or lip. Thomas Rhett just shuts up, counts the money, and does his awkward white boy dances as best he can. He's a good old fashioned hoodwinked American goober who's probably not a bad guy personally, but has no business being foisted upon a pedestal to have a spotlight shown on him, unless it's as an example of a raging averageness.

Country only in name and marketing, Life Changes is a boring, fiercely-formulaic, culturally-appropriating Bruno Mars ripoff. I wish this was hyperbole, but having trudged through multiple spins of Life Changes to the great detriment of my will to exist and much soul searching in the choices in career paths, I can dutifully report that it's consistently terrible, with urbanized annunciations, formulaic phrases and modes, and mere pixels of moments peppered throughout that could be remarked upon positively. It's pop music, but not even good pop. It's watered-down, rehashed, risk-averse pap looking to make just enough noise to get noticed, without really saying anything. (read more)

Walker Hayes – Boom

I would rather personally watch my male genitalia cleaved clean off my abdomen with the combination of a rusty maul and a frozen sledge hammer, then strapped up with a Go Pro and my eyes clamped open and forced to watch on a monitor as a carrion bird carries it far away before ultimately descending into some foul-drenched alleyway drowning in refuse to vulturously pull at the bloody and putrefying flesh with its beak and talons, only to regurgitate it hours later after it's marinated in the most vile hell of scavenger digestive juices, to then be re-consumed eventually by an emaciated mongrel and vomited up again in the middle of the road, and trundled over by heavy vehicles so many times it becomes no more discernible from a spot of grease discarded from the undercarriage of a Toyota than listen to one more electronically-derived and idiotically conceived millisecond of Walker Hayes' Boom.

Walker Hayes is a complete construct of desperation, and of slavitude to whatever he thinks will sell, along with an assessment from the new Country Music Antichrist, Shane McAnally, who relaunched the old mothballed label Monument Records just to produce and release this piece of shit, and inflict the world with the pussing musical scourge known as Walker Hayes and Boom. Not even Nashville's unscrupulous major labels would sign off on this it was so terrible. Shane McAnally had to make a label especially for it. Being the principle puppetmaster behind Sam Hunt wasn't enough for Shane McAnally. Now there should not be a shadow of a doubt left in anyone's mind what McAnally's agenda in music is, which is to completely reshape "country" into his own image, which happens to be an extremely urban, stultifying, primarily laptop-composed shitblob served with an almost sadist attitude, and with the sole purpose of making himself lots of fucking money at the direct expense of the intelligence and mental well being of the masses. Selling copies of Boom is like purposely giving people a disease to make a profit. It is cultural poison. (read more)

Luke Bryan – What Makes You Country

At this point, Luke Bryan couldn't make a quality country record even if he wanted to. That ship has sailed. He's now simply the figurehead of a franchise that employs a small army of merchandisers, managers, publicists, roadies, and side musicians, that leases an entire fleet of trucks and buses, helps pay the salaries of fat cat label executives executives, and not to mention the imperative to help prop up the entire commercial country industry itself as a flagship artist, selling a lock step corporate country lifestyle brand to America via outdoor outfitters, corporate beer sponsors, and domestic full size truck manufacturers, greasing the wheels of commerce and an insatiable appetite to consume by the American public.

Luke Bryan is the Ronald McDonald of country music. Millions and millions served, even if the fare is nothing more than palatable. So many paychecks and livelihoods beyond Bryan's own inner circle depend on him taking center stage and shaking his ass for the amusement of millions each year that it is mandated his music delivers in a very well-ordered and predictable manner so that the superstructure of this whole mainstream country music facade is not rocked, lest it topple over and expose everything as the mother of all cultural ruses exploiting the Southern identity.

Shania Twain – Now

The production of Now couldn't be more wrong, so much so that it might be an ideal specimen to hold up to the light and diagram in what to avoid in modern music making. At an incredible 16 songs in the deluxe edition, five separate producers credited, and some 15 years in the making, the fact that this is all they could come up with is beyond unconscionable. There's not really even any variety. Every song seems to be hindered by this insurmountably cloistered, unimaginative, uninspired, poor interpretation of what is relevant in music today, rendering each and every one of these songs excruciatingly disappointing even to those who'd steeled themselves anticipating the lowest rung of measured expectations.

There are no acoustic moments, which could have worked for certain songs, no responsibility to a song like "Pour Me" that works well on paper. It's just the same lazy synthesized and computerized production nearly devoid of human contact on one unlistenable song after another.

Most notably in the production of Now is the egregious, offensive use of Auto-tune and other vocal enhancements on most all the tracks, rendering an iconic voice from one of country music's most accomplished performers into nothing more that an objectionably-processed electronically-transmogrified audio signal that at times is so enveloped in digital enhancements, is downright inaudible, and resembles nothing even close to a diminished shade of Shania's authentic tone.

Dishonorable Mention:Adults who lived high-stress childhoods have trouble reading the signs that a loss or punishment is looming, leaving themselves in situations that risk avoidable health and financial problems and legal trouble.

According to researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, this difficulty may be biological, stemming from an unhelpful lack of activity in the brain when a situation should be prompting heightened awareness. And that discovery may help train at-risk young people to be better at avoiding risk.

"It's not that people are overtly deciding to take these negative risks, or do things that might get them in trouble," says Seth Pollak, a UW-Madison psychology professor who has studied kids and stress for decades. "It may very well be that their brains are not really processing the information that should tell them they are headed to a bad place, that this is not the right step to take."

Pollak and UW-Madison psychiatry Professor Rasmus Birn brought back to the lab more than 50 people -- now ages 20 to 23 -- who were participants in a study Pollak conducted about stress hormones when they were 8 years old. They were drawn equally from that study's least-stressed and most-stressed kids. Those who dealt with chronic high stress as children experienced traumatic events like parents killed by gunfire or substance abuse, multiple foster home placements and severe maltreatment, according to Pollak.

The researchers put the adults through a series of tasks -- while in and out of brain-scanning functional magnetic resonance imagers (fMRI) -- designed to stimulate the brain regions that weigh gain and loss, risk and reward.

The high childhood stress group was less attentive to potential loss than the low childhood stress group, and more piqued by resulting losses. The results were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Among the most striking outcomes, Birn says, was watching the high-stress group work through a gambling scenario in which a token is hidden behind one of 10 squares. Some of the squares are colored red, others blue. The object is to choose the color of the square covering the token.

"Most people if you see nine red squares, one blue square -- and the token is randomly placed -- you're going to guess red," he says. "And yet, in a lot of these individuals who experienced high childhood stress we saw, they're betting on the one instead of the nine. And they're betting against the odds again and again."

And they spent longer doing it, according to Pollak, agonizing over the decision before making a poor decision again.

"It was our observation not that they couldn't do math, but that they weren't really attending to the right things," he says. "We didn't see people improving over time. You might say, 'Well, they don't get how it works.' But the people with high-stress childhoods, even after many trials, they weren't using negative feedback to change their behavior and improve."

In brain scans from the people who lived with high stress as children, Birn and Pollak could see a surprisingly low amount of activity in the brain region expected to light up when confronted by a potential loss.

"And then, when they would lose, we'd see more activity than expected -- an overreaction -- in the part of the brain that responds to reward," Pollak says, "which makes sense. If you didn't catch the cue that you were likely to lose, you're probably going to be pretty shocked when you don't win."

The high-stress childhood group also reported undertaking more risky behaviors -- smoking, not wearing a seatbelt in a car or texting while driving -- on a regular basis than their low-stress counterparts.

Interestingly, it was just the childhood stress level -- not the level of stress in the participants' adult lives -- that was predictive of their ability to identify potential loss or avoid risky behavior.

The researchers' knowledge of their subjects' childhood stress is unique. Typically, assessing the childhood of a group of adults requires relying on their recollections and spotty records.

"But we knew these people when they were kids," says Pollak. "We have a clinical assessment of their stress levels in childhood that was done at that time of their lives, while their parents sat in the waiting room. That's powerful data."

The results are powerful, too, and have already drawn interest from child welfare authorities and family court judges often in the position of trying to change behavior by threatening or applying punishment.

"So many of our behavioral interventions are predicated on the idea that people will understand there's a sign they're about to be punished," Pollak says. "Maybe we need to rethink some of those things."

And maybe people can be taught to spot potential loss and risk. Understanding the brain mechanisms that contribute to repeated poor judgment could illuminate ways to prevent it.

"What are they paying attention to? What associations from past experience are they able to remember and connect? Can we help them make better observations and predictions?" Pollak says. "Framing behavioral problems as a learning problem opens up new doors of what we can do to help people."

Next, the researchers plan to expand the scope of their brain scans and analyses.

"Now that we have this finding, we can use it to guide us to look at specific networks in the brain that are active and functionally connected," Birn says. "We may find that childhood stress reshapes the way communication happens across the brain."John Measey flew to Venezuela in 1997 in search of peculiar amphibians that looked like snakes or worms and lived underground. Measey's team trekked through the rainforest, flipping over logs and digging into soil. After a few weeks, they still hadn't found a single one.

Since some of these legless animals, known as caecilians (seh-CEE-lee-enz), also live in water, Measey travelled to a small fishing village at the edge of a large, bright-green lake. The villagers had set up toilets on piers over the lake, and they told Measey that they had seen animals that looked like eels when they went to the bathroom. So Measey jumped into the lake.

"We were absolutely excited," he says. Measey is an evolutionary biologist — a scientist who studies the way living creatures have changed over long periods of time — now at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. "I had no problem jumping into the pea-green lake." Sure enough, he found caecilians wriggling between stones in a wall at the lake's edge.

Caecilians belong to the same group of animals that includes frogs and salamanders. But unlike other amphibians, caecilians lack legs. Some caecilians are as short as a pencil, while others grow as long as a child. Their eyes are tiny and hidden beneath skin and sometimes bone. And they have a pair of tentacles on their face that can sniff out chemicals in the environment.

"The whole creature is really quite bizarre," says Emma Sherratt, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University.

Not a snake, not a worm

Scientists first started studying caecilians in the 1700s. At first, some researchers thought the animals were snakes. But caecilians are very different. Snakes have scales on the outside of their body, while caecilian skin is made up of ring-shaped folds encircling the body. These folds often have scales embedded in them. Most caecilians do not have a tail; snakes do. Caecilians differ from their other lookalike, worms, in part because they possess a backbone and a skull.

Biologists know very little about these creatures, compared with other animals. Because most caecilians burrow underground, they can be hard to find. They live in wet, tropical areas such as Central and South America, Africa, India and Southeast Asia — regions where until recently there weren't many biologists. When local people do see caecilians, they often mistake them for snakes or worms.

"This is a major group of living creatures, and so few people even know they exist," says Sherratt. "It's just got this mistaken identity."

Scientists now believe that caecilians, frogs and salamanders all evolved, or slowly changed over a long period of time, from a group of animals that lived more than 275 million years ago. These ancient animals probably looked more like a salamander, a small, four-legged creature with a tail. Biologists suspect those salamander-like ancestors might have started burrowing in leaf piles and eventually into the soil to hide from predators or to search for new sources of food.

As these animals spent more time underground, they evolved to become better burrowers. Over time, their legs disappeared and their bodies lengthened. Their skulls became very strong and thick, allowing the animals to ram their heads through the soil. They didn't need to see much anymore, so their eyes shrank. A layer of skin or bone also grew over the eyes to protect them from dirt. And the creatures formed tentacles that could sense chemicals, helping the animals find prey in the dark.

Expert excavators

Caecilians are now superb burrowers. Jim O'Reilly, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago, and his colleagues wanted to find out how hard caecilians could push against soil. In the lab, the team set up an artificial tunnel. They filled one end with dirt and put a brick at that end to stop the animal from burrowing any farther. To measure how hard the caecilian pushed, the scientists attached a device called a force plate to the tunnel.

A 50- to 60-centimeter-long (roughly 1.5- to 2-foot-long) caecilian proved much stronger than O'Reilly had expected. "It just shoved this brick off the table," he recalls. The scientists performed the same experiment with similar-sized mud snakes and burrowing boas. The caecilians could push about twice as hard as both types of snakes, the researchers found.

The secret to caecilians' strength may be a coiled set of tissues called tendons.

These tendons look like two intertwined Slinkies inside the animal's body. As a burrowing caecilian holds its breath and contracts — or flexes — its muscles, the tendons stretch out as if something is pulling the Slinkies. The caecilian's body becomes a little longer and thinner, pushing the skull forward. Worms move in a similar way, but they use muscles circling their body and extending lengthwise instead of spiraling tendons. To pull up the rest of its body, the caecilian relaxes the muscles in its body wall and scrunches up its backbone. This causes the body to become a little shorter and fatter.

After multiple cycles of the head burrowing forward and the body catching up, the caecilian may come to rest. At this point, it may exhale, its body going limp.

Caecilians have also come up with clever ways to capture their prey. To study the amphibian's hunting techniques, Measey's team filled an aquarium with soil and let 21- to 24-centimeter-long caecilians burrow tunnels. The team added earthworms and crickets, which caecilians like to eat. Because the aquarium was very thin, almost like a picture frame, the researchers could film what was happening in the burrows.

After an earthworm burrowed into a caecilian's tunnel, the caecilian grabbed the earthworm with its teeth and started spinning around like a rolling pin. This spinning pulled the whole worm into the caecilian's burrow and might have even made the worm dizzy. Measey thinks this trick might also give caecilians a better idea of how heavy their prey is. "If it's a rat's tail, you may just want to let go," he says.

Dining on skin

Baby caecilians may have the oddest behavior of all. Some caecilians lay eggs in an underground chamber. After the eggs hatch, the young remain with their mother for about four to six weeks. Until recently, scientists weren't sure how the mother fed her offspring.

Alex Kupfer, a zoologist now at the University of Potsdam in Germany, investigated. He travelled to Kenya to collect female caecilians and their eggs or babies from underground burrows. Then he put the animals in boxes and watched.

Most of the time, babies lay quietly with their mother. But once in awhile, the young caecilians started crawling all over her, tearing off pieces of her skin and eating it. "I thought, 'Wow, cool,'" says Kupfer. "There's no other behavior in the animal kingdom I can compare with this." The mother isn't hurt because her outer layer of skin is already dead, he says.

Kupfer's team looked at pieces of the mother's skin under a microscope and saw that the cells were unusually big. The cells also contained more fat than cells from female caecilians that weren't raising young. So the skin probably gives babies a lot of energy and nutrition. To rip off their mother's skin, young caecilians use special teeth. Some are like scrapers, with two or three points; others are shaped like hooks.

Kupfer thinks his team's findings may reveal one step in the animals' evolution. Ancient caecilians probably laid eggs but didn't take care of their young. Today, some species of caecilians don't lay eggs at all. Instead, they give birth to live young. These babies grow inside a tube in the mother's body, called an oviduct, and use their teeth to scrape the lining of the tube for nutrition. The caecilians that Kupfer studied appear somewhere in between: They still lay eggs, but the babies dine on their mother's skin instead of her oviduct.

More secrets and surprises

Scientists still have a lot of questions about caecilians. Researchers have little idea how long most species live, how old the females are when they first give birth and how often they have babies. And biologists have yet to discover how frequently caecilians fight and whether they travel much or spend life largely in one place.

As scientists learn more about caecilians, surprises often emerge. In the 1990s, researchers discovered that a dead specimen of a large, water-dwelling caecilian had no lungs. It probably breathed in all of the air it needed through its skin. So scientists thought this species might inhabit cold, fast-flowing mountain streams, where the water contains more oxygen. But last year, these lungless caecilians were found alive in a completely different place: warm, low-lying rivers in the Brazilian Amazon. Somehow this caecilian species still gets enough oxygen, perhaps because parts of the river flow so fast.

Scientists have identified at least 185 different species of caecilians. And there may be more. In February 2012, a team led by researchers at the University of Delhi in India announced they had discovered a new type of caecilian, which includes several species. These amphibians from northeastern India live underground, vary in color from light gray to purple and can grow more than a meter (almost 4 feet) long.

Not knowing much about caecilians makes it hard to determine whether their species are surviving comfortably or in peril. And that's important, because throughout the past two decades, many amphibian populations have begun to disappear. Some species have gone extinct. Threats include disappearing habitat, other species invading the amphibians' homes and a fungus that causes a killer disease. But researchers aren't sure how many caecilian species might be similarly threatened because they don't know how many of these animals existed to begin with. Biologists will need to monitor caecilians more carefully to find out whether populations of their species are declining — and if so, where.

It's unlikely that any wild caecilians live in the United States or Canada. But in tropical areas, scientists can learn a lot about them if they look hard enough. "Caecilians are there," says Sherratt. "They just need more people to start digging for them."

Item #: SCP-2334

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2334 is contained on site at its location in Utah. Although potentially hazardous records remain in the facility, Level 3 researchers may enter to study catalogued records with proper authorization from their supervisors.

Description: SCP-2334 is an anomalous underground salt mine and photograph storage facility near Salt Lake City, Utah, with a single known entrance located at coordinates N██°██'██.██" W███°██'██.██". Intelligence suggests that it may contain every possible photograph in the RGB color spectrum, printed at an approximate resolution of 2000 by 3000 pixels.

SCP-2334 came to the attention of the Foundation after photocopies of a photograph of the following document began to circulate among students at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, in September 1996. Distribution was localized to a religious sect of students who wore colorful, static-patterned clothing. Containment personnel administered Class-A amnestics to students who received photocopies of sensitive materials.

Artifact Class: Innoxious Spatial Control Paradigm: If not in trials, SCP-2626 should inhabit a thick bin at Plot 19. Staff may ask to work with SCP-2626 for study trials by submitting a physical proposal to a Lvl. 3 boss, who must wait in physical form to watch all handling of said artifact. ...

These copies appeared to be photographs of official Foundation documents, albeit with text altered to avoid use of the letter 'e'. Five different classified documents — reports regarding SCP-2626, -████, -████, -████, and -████ — were found to be circulating, all on official Foundation letterhead. Students possessing copies were interrogated, and the source was traced to a small abandoned house in ████████, Utah, where similar photographs were found pinned to the walls. An entrance to the storage facility was discovered on the adjoining property.

In Operation Oulipo, Foundation personnel questioned and interrogated ██ subjects who inhabited the facility (see: Addendum-A), all of whom were affiliated with the religious sect known as the Monks of the Archive. On entering the storage facility, personnel investigated █████ rooms.

SCP-2334 is not believed to be endless, but rather significantly larger than the spatial constraints of the local geology would normally allow. It is believed that additional members of the religious sect may remain within the caverns, but attempts to locate them have been unsuccessful.

Addendum-A: Operation Oulipo

The individuals detained in Operation Oulipo identified themselves as members of a religious group and wore ceremonial garments with colorful static patterns. They did not exhibit resistance until Foundation personnel requested access to rooms beyond those in the nearest cluster to the entrance, at which point they reacted violently. █ were terminated on site, and the rest were detained.

The detained individuals did not provide reliable intelligence. Below is a brief excerpt from one of the more productive interviews.

Interviewed: 2334-D2 ("Brother Pixel") Interviewer: Dr. Calvino <Begin Log, 11-09-1996 04:31 p.m.> Calvino: If these caverns contain every possible photograph, why are there humans and depictions of Earth in so many of the photos we've seen? 2334-D2: You've only seen the part that's closest to us — they printed it that way, as they carved this place from the salt. It's much larger than you think. Calvino: Who's they? 2334-D2: They printed everything. Calvino: What do you mean? 2334-D2: We follow they who have seen all, they who have known all, they who have seen the one true image. Calvino: And that's supposed to be — 2334-D2: With every passing day, our pilgrims travel deeper toward its source. Calvino: Are there more of you down there? 2334-D2 refused to answer any additional questions.

Addendum-B: Image Samples

The following images were chosen to provide an overview of the image characteristics discovered in each subsequent room. Most images were unrecognizable static, so these samples were also selected for clarity.

Addendum-C: Document 2334-73███

The following document was found in the archive room designated 73███, beside an elderly man's corpse that was found in an advanced state of decomposition.

May 1 Entered the sacred realm today. My body thirsted for knowledge, but they only granted me static and images without form. I sense this journey will be long, and I must return with supplies. May 3 I saw something that almost looked like a dog today, but Brother Gradient insisted it was not a dog. May 10 I know the brothers forbid my writings, but I feel I must record what happens in these sacred caverns. I believe I saw a man's face in the static today. May 15 Brother Vector found an entire word today. The word was "calcify" — It looked as if it had been written on a typewriter, but I dare not assert that. May 28 We are running low on supplies, but a trip back to the surface is not in order. We pledged to find the one true image and not to return until we had done so. Time seems to move different here. Though we have not shaved, none of the men have grown beards since we departed. July ? Today we saw green for the first time in weeks. Praise Them! ? ? The static burns my eyes.

Addendum-D: Possible Dimensions

No evidence has been discovered concerning another entrance or end point to the archive.

Research theories regarding the size of the archive are based on statistical analysis of pixel values in images recovered from the site. In short, the distribution of pixels suggests a complete set of images, were one to travel far enough through the archive.

The total number of images possible at 2000 by 3000 pixels (the approximate resolution of each print) is calculated to be 224^6000000, or nearly 1010^10^7.The city of Seattle has settled a lawsuit with the one of the men accusing former mayor Ed Murray of sexual abuse, the city attorney's office announced Saturday.

The city attorney's office said the city, a defendant in the lawsuit, settled with 46-year-old Delvonn Heckard and will pay $150,000. Heckard accused Murray of sexually abusing him in the 1980s for years starting when Heckard was 15 years old.

"With this settlement, the city takes an important step in putting this sad chapter behind us, limiting litigation expenses, and allowing Mr. Heckard to move forward with his life," said City Attorney Holmes in a statement Saturday evening. A mayor's office spokesperson said the parties reached the agreement late Saturday afternoon. "Mr. Beauregard and I personally spent many hours working on this settlement over the hectic holiday season, and together we fashioned our best opportunity for healing for all."

Heckard first sued Murray on April 6 alleging the sexual abuse, prompting Murray to end his re-election bid one month later. While Heckard dropped the lawsuit in June after some unfavorable rulings by a King County Superior Court judge, the allegations ultimately brought a total of five accusers forward and led to Murray's resignation in September.

Two other men accused Murray of sexual abuse years ago. When Heckard dropped the lawsuit in June, Murray considered a write-in campaign before he chose instead to endorse Jenny Durkan for mayor.

Heckard's attorney filed another lawsuit against Murray on October 23, this time including the city and accusing city officials of negligence and defamation.

In a released statement Saturday, Lincoln Beauregard, one of Heckard's attorneys, said Heckard appreciates the city's offer "to amicably resolve this matter and to bring this community some peace at the end of this difficult year."

"This case was never about the money, but the settlement funds will greatly assist Mr. Heckard in his continued recovery," Beauregard said.

Murray continued to deny the allegations up until his exit from City Hall. In a statement to reporters Saturday, the former mayor continued to deny them and addressed backlash in his earlier defense, which The Stranger published as an op-ed.

Beauregard said $100,000 of the settlement will go to Heckard, and attorneys will donate the rest to sexual assault survivor support organizations: $25,000 to the King County Sexual Assault Resource Center, $12,500 to the Harborview Sexual Assault & Trauma Unit, and $12,500 to the Silent Task Force.

"I agree with the city attorney that settling this lawsuit is the right thing to do and allows our city to begin to heal," Mayor Durkan said in a released statement. "As someone who has represented victims of sexual assault, I know this has caused a lot of pain and trauma for Mr. Heckard as well as many survivors."

Late last week, the U.S District Court in Seattle struck down a federal immigration policy that prevented family members in other countries from joining their relatives with refugee status in the U.S. And the bureaucratic machinery is reportedly in motion again as the federal government resumed processing follow-to-join petitions that could reunite families.

"We are extremely pleased that that is the case," said Emily Chiang, the legal director of ACLU-WA, which filed the motion that led to the decision.

Aspects of the so-called Muslim Ban are being challenged by attorneys general in the District Court of Hawaii and by the ACLU in Maryland. But the Doe vs. Trump motion was the first to address the provision preventing families from reuniting. In delivering his decision, U.S. District Judge James Robart reanimated a process that has reunited approximately 2,500 families annually, according to the ruling. It is unclear how many Washington families would be impacted by Saturday's ruling, but Chiang noted that the state admits the eighth most refugees in the country.

In addition to the Doe vs. Trump ruling, Robart granted a partial nationwide injunction on a ban of refugees from 11 countries, most of which are predominately Muslim. In response to a motion brought by Jewish Family Services and other plaintiffs, Robart wrote in a 65-page memo that the injunction would apply to currently banned refugees "with a bona fide relationship to a person or entity within the United States." Ties to refugee resettlement organizations qualify as bona fide relationships under the order.

In response, the federal government filed a motion Wednesday evening urging Judge Robart to reconsider the provision that identifies association with a refugee resettlement organization as a bona fide relationship, Chiang told Seattle Weekly on Thursday. "We're going to have to respond to those papers, and we'll go from there," she concluded.

The Doe vs. Trump case was filed by ACLU-WA in February on behalf of a Somali national who goes by the pseudonym Joseph Doe. He brought the case anonymously, because he's "understandably terrified of retaliation by the Trump administration," Chiang said.

Doe fled Somalia's civil war with his family as a child "after a very arduous and horrible journey in which his sister was killed en route," Chiang said. He and his remaining family members settled in a Kenyan refugee camp and he eventually married a local woman and had children. Meanwhile, his refugee application that was initiated as a child permitted him to move to the United States in 2014. He became a permanent resident two years later. All the while, his family remained in Kenya. Doe initiated a follow-to-join petition to bring his entire family with him in Washington once he arrived, but their application has not been approved since Trump issued the first immigration executive order in January.

Saturday's ruling could change that. "I am very happy that the judge recognized my right to have my family join me here in the United States, and I hope that they can come here as soon as possible," said Doe, according to a Sunday press release.

Correction: A previous version of this story stated that refugee resettlement organizations reportedly resumed processing follow-to-join petitions. In fact, the federal government reportedly resumed processing the petitions.We are committed to ending all forms of forced genital cutting which is by definition non-therapeutic. This includes female genital mutilation (FGM) and the religiously or culturally-motivated cutting of boys' genitals.

The NSS supports a person's most fundamental right to grow up with an intact body and to make their own choices about permanent bodily modifications; these basic rights must not be overridden because of other people's dogma. Traditional religious and cultural practices are often promoted by adults within a community. Children, and particularly young infants, are obviously incapable of giving consent to such medically unnecessary and harmful procedures. Child safeguarding must be the priority rather than appeasing the desire of adults within a community to express their belief through forced cutting of their child's genitals.

What's the problem?

The types of genital interference performed on children for religious or cultural reasons range from a symbolic pin-prick to removal of of the most sensitive parts of the genitals.

All forms of forced cutting on children's genitals breach basic child safeguarding guidance and all are claimed by the cutting communities themselves as beneficial for the child in terms of conforming to cultural or religious norms.

Sometimes additional health benefits for non-therapeutic genital cutting are claimed despite the evidence to the contrary. All forms of forced genital cutting risk serious sexual, physical and emotional harm and carry a risk of death from a procedure performed for no medical reason.

Male Circumcision

Infant male circumcision or non-therapeutic excision of the foreskin (NTEF) is increasingly under the spotlight largely due to an international community of medics, lawyers and human rights workers challenging the myths and promoting child safeguarding in the face of threats from traditional religious or cultural practices. Where the practice is 'justified' it is usually done so on the grounds of religion or culture.

Even now there is very limited regulation of non-therapeutic circumcision in the UK. Doctors registered with the GMC (the UK doctors' regulatory body) must perform the procedure in suitable medical settings with appropriate attention to hygiene, sterility and aftercare. Extraordinarily, however, there is no requirement for the non-consenting child to have a medical problem in order for their foreskin to be removed.

Non-doctors performing infant circumcision in the UK have no such regulation and are free to cut boys' penises with unsterilised scissors or knives on kitchen tables or ironing boards. We do not know how many such procedures are performed annually nor the degree of harm as there is no requirement for any follow up or audit and the boys themselves are too young to complain.

In some NHS Trusts non-therapeutic infant circumcision is taxpayer funded in a misguided attempt to limit the harm done. A similar proposal by the American Academy of Pediatricians in 2010 to perform 'minor' FGM on baby girls in a hospital setting to prevent greater harm was abandoned within weeks in the face of an international outcry.

Throughout history, male circumcision has been advocated as a pseudo-medical cure for a variety of ailments ranging from TB to epilepsy to warts to excessive masturbation. However, any marginal health claims are extremely contested. No national medical, paediatric, surgical or urological society in the world of which the NSS is aware recommends routine circumcision of all boys as a health intervention. If the benefits of the operation outweighed the risks, NHS doctors would be recommending it for every child – regardless of the parents' religion – and they do not.

The foreskin is a normal body part with physical, sexual and immunological functions. Surgically removing it from non-consenting children has been associated with various physical and psychological difficulties; these are likely to be greatly under-reported because people who have experienced sexual harm are often reluctant to reveal it as societal dismissal or stigmatisation may compound the harm.

There is now a growing medical consensus that existing ethical principles of non-therapeutic childhood surgery should no longer include an exception for non-therapeutic excision of the foreskin. In May 2010, the Royal Dutch Medical Association (KNMG) in association with all the major Dutch medical colleges released a policy statement asserting that: "non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors is a violation of children's rights to autonomy and physical integrity. Contrary to popular belief, circumcision can cause complications – bleeding, infection, urethral stricture and panic attacks are particularly common. KNMG is therefore urging a strong policy of deterrence. KNMG is calling upon doctors to actively and insistently inform parents who are considering the procedure of the absence of medical benefits and the danger of complications."

In 2016 the Danish Medical Association also called for an end to male circumcision, arguing that the procedure should only ever be performed with "informed consent". This follows the joint statement in 2013 by all the Scandinavian children's ombudsmen that children should be allowed to choose for themselves and that non-therapeutic childhood circumcision 'violates fundamental medical-ethical principles'.

In April 2018 a proposal to the Danish government to create a gender-neutral age of consent of 18 for all forms of non-therapeutic genital cutting was rejected, despite considerable public support.

In September 2017 the Belgium federal government's Committee for Bio-Ethics ruled that bodily integrity was more important than religious faith. Although this is not binding in law, it adds to the growing weight of medical opinion against unnecessary male circumcision.

A draft bill was put before the Icelandic government in 2018 to ban non-consensual ritual circumcision for boys, but it was rejected following heavy lobbying from religious groups.

In its 2018 report the Child Rights International Network (CRIN) called the ritual circumcision of infant males for non-medical reasons a "violation of bodily integrity" which "unnecessarily" exposes children to risks.

We welcome that the lawfulness of child circumcision is being increasingly questioned and that medical opinion in a number of countries is similarly turning against the historic carte blanche afforded to infant circumcision on the basis that the parents' freedom of religion is the only or overriding consideration. It is now being recognised more widely that this non-therapeutic procedure for which there are numerous complications, some of which are very serious, is a breach of children's rights.

The UN Convention on the rights of the child (UNCRC) recommends respect for the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and advises that traditional practices prejudicial to the health of children should be abolished. We are keen to ensure that legal protections from forced genital cutting encompass all children and that much more action is taken to protect children from harmful religious or cultural surgery.

What are we doing?

Members of the Secular Medical Forum have raised awareness of the harms and the discordance with child safeguarding policies within the UK medical community.

We have engaged the British Medical Association which is currently reconsidering its 2006 position on non-therapeutic male circumcision as a direct result of our efforts.

We are also calling on the UN committee on the Rights of the Child, the UK government and the UK Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights to investigate whether non-therapeutic infant circumcision is a breach of UK children's rights.

In 2013 we actively supported a Council of Europe resolution condemning male circumcision as a "violation of the physical integrity of children" ­– a position subsequently watered down following pressure from Jewish and Muslim groups.

In December 2017 Amazon UK withdrew infant circumcision training kits from sale over child safety concerns following a National Secular Society request to do so.

Female genital mutilation (FGM)

Defeated 1993 Brent Council motion on making FGM available on the NHS ( At the time councillors opposing the motion were abused and accused of racism/cultural insensitivity. Today the failed motion shows how far we've come in campaigning to eradicate this practice. ) ...a right specifically for African families who want to carry on their tradition whilst living in this country...

We are committed to the eradication of forced genital cutting of girls and women known as Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in all its forms. There are thought to be well over 100,000 women and girls affected by FGM living in the UK today. We work with like-minded organisations to protect girls from all non-therapeutic interference with their genitals and to help ensure future generations do not have to face the harm of forced genital cutting.

FGM practices vary. Some forms involve a pinprick or the removal of a small amount of material from the clitoris. Other forms include complete excision of the clitoris and/or labia, and stitching the vulva closed (infibulation).

All forms of FGM are illegal in the UK and are child abuse.

Despite it being a criminal offence since 1985 there have been no successful prosecutions for FGM. In part this reflects some of the difficulties of challenging cultural practices embedded within communities. It is also an indicator of ignorance of the harms, sometimes spread deliberately, and fear of speaking out from within a community. As with all forms of forced genital cutting, those who speak out against it are often accused of disrespect to their parents or cultural elders, of over-dramatising a 'minor' procedure that others 'don't complain about' and of malice. Together with the perceived humiliation of speaking about one's own genitals these factors combine to ensure that many sufferers are reluctant to speak out- particularly those who are otherwise in a loving relationship with their family or community of origin.

Between January and March 2016 the Health and Social Care Information Centre uncovered 1242 new cases of FGM in England. Despite much collaborative work to challenge the practice we know that some British girls are still unprotected. Some have been sent back to the countries of their parents' origin and others are having it performed secretly in this country.

We therefore question why there has not been a single successful prosecution since the practice became illegal. We are concerned that fear of upsetting cultural and religious sensitivities prevents such abuse and bodily harm from being tackled effectively.

Ending FGM is not simply a criminal justice issue, it requires sustained civil society action to change attitudes and inform girls of their rights.

"It is irrelevant whether or not a person believed the operation to be necessary in the child's best interests as a matter of custom or ritual." - Section 1(5) of the Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) Act

What are we doing?

The NSS is supporting civil society and governmental attempts to educate around, raise awareness of and eradicate FGM. In 2016 we raised UK's failure to successfully prosecute a single case of FGM with the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and urged the UN to question the UK Government on its strategy to combat all forms of violence against women and girls. We urged the UN to stress to the UK that the universality of individual Human Rights should be upheld and never overridden on the grounds of religion, tradition or culture.

We are working with like-minded national and international organisations (eg CRIN, Genital Autonomy, Equality Now and Forward), to develop our understanding of the most effective methods of ending forced genital cutting and of protecting our children.

Show edits and commentsStanford offense should be strong in '18 — superb if Bryce Love returns

SAN ANTONIO — Depending on All-America running back Bryce Love's decision about whether to go to the NFL, Stanford could have one of the best offenses in its history next season.

The thought of a full season of Love and quarterback K.J. Costello, with almost all the wide receivers, tight ends and offensive linemen back, might prompt visions of a Rose Bowl to dance in the heads of Cardinal fans.

Stanford's offense will be in the hands of a new coordinator, Tavita Pritchard, and head coach David Shaw says he'll name an offensive line coach who also will serve as running-game coordinator.

While the No. 15 Cardinal licked their wounds from their 39-37 loss to No. 13 TCU in Thursday night's Alamo Bowl, Shaw indicated that he senses a big improvement on this season's 9-5 record is in store for 2018.

"I'm so excited, so excited for what we have coming back on this football team," he said after the game. "And there's a lot of work to be done and a lot of things that we can improve, and so many areas that we are going to get so much better."

One of those areas is the pass rush. The Cardinal had 32 sacks, a far cry from the meet-at-the-quarterback gang led by Trent Murphy, Chase Thomas and Ben Gardner that posted a school-record 57 in 2012. The 2018 team won't need to match that total, but it will have to put more heat on quarterbacks in the Pac-12.

The receiving corps should be especially loaded, beginning with starters JJ Arcega-Whiteside (unless he decides to turn pro after his three-touchdown night in San Antonio) and Trent Irwin and including holdovers Connor Wedington and Donald Stewart. Redshirt freshman Osiris St. Brown and incoming freshman Michael Wilson will join an enticing mix.

Even if Love leaves, the tailback position will be in good hands. Cameron Scarlett averaged 4.3 yards per carry and scored eight touchdowns as the main short-yardage back. He would make a fine featured tailback, backed by Trevor Speights, Dorian Maddox and possibly Wedington, who might have a dual role.

It is believed that backup quarterback Keller Chryst, who has started 13 games, may play elsewhere as a graduate transfer. That would leave the No. 2 role to redshirt freshman Davis Mills while incoming Jack West goes through a redshirt season.

The only other certain and significant offensive losses would be Daniel Marx, a fixture at fullback for four years; versatile offensive lineman David Bright and starting tight end Dalton Schultz. Reagan Williams or Houston Heimuli could succeed Marx. Brandon Fanaika might start at left guard for Bright unless he decides to leave with a year of eligibility left. And Scooter Harrington probably would become the main blocking tight end; Kaden Smith and Colby Parkinson continue mainly as excellent receivers.

An intriguing question in the offensive line is whether tackle Foster Sarell would play. One of the nation's top recruits in 2017, he played mainly on special teams. But the two starting tackles, Walker Little and A.T. Hall, will return, so one of the tackles might move to guard.

On defense, All-Pac-12 lineman Harrison Phillips is leaving early, and so may two other all-conference picks, safety Justin Reid and cornerback Quenton Meeks. End Eric Cotton departs, leaving just Dylan Jackson from the starting defensive line.

The coaches are counting on Dalyn Wade-Perry, a 6-4, 332-pound freshman tackle, and sophomores Michael Williams, Jovan Swan and Thomas Schaffer to step into the line rotation. Ryan Johnson could make it, too, although he has struggled with injuries through his redshirt season. Even four-star prospects Thomas Booker and Andres Fox could play as freshmen.

Elsewhere in the defense, there are far more experienced players. Joey Alfieri, Casey Toohill, Jordan Fox and Curtis Robinson will make for a strong contingent of outside linebackers even after Peter Kalambayi and Mike Tyler leave.

Inside backer Bobby Okereke looks to be in the mold of former Cardinal standouts Shayne Skov, A.J. Tarpley and Blake Martinez. Sean Barton, a starter who suffered a season-ending knee injury against San Diego State in September, might miss spring ball, but figures prominently in Stanford's plans for next season. Jordan Perez and Mustafa Branch also will be back.

The newcomer to watch in the secondary is freshman cornerback Paulson Adebo, who combines size (6-foot-1) and speed. He might replace Meeks, if he leaves, or Alijah Holder, if he's not back from his knee injury. Another promising cornerback is sophomore Obi Eboh. Terrence Alexander may be back if he gets a medical waiver, in which case, he would join holdovers Alameen Murphy and Malik Antoine.

Reid may depart at safety/nickel back, but Frank Buncom and Ben Edwards will return at safety. Brandon Simmons, a special-teams standout, or Denzel Franklin could take Reid's spot. Another player to watch: Stuart Head, a 6-4 safety.

The special teams should be in excellent shape with Jake Bailey, a terrific punter and kickoff man, and Jet Toner, one of the Pac-12's best placekickers. Scarlett was second in the conference in kickoff returns (26.0) and had 11 of 30 yards or more, the most in any Power 5 conference.

"So many guys played" Thursday night, Shaw said. "I have a firm belief that when we start next year, you may not recognize them. I think we're going to make a huge jump, and I think we need to."

Linebacker has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

Ryan Beecher, a backup inside linebacker for Stanford, missed the Alamo Bowl on Thursday because he was diagnosed last week with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, he said Friday from his home in Fresno.

Beecher, the MVP in his senior season at San Joaquin Memorial-Fresno and the class valedictorian, said he is due for more tests. The initial scan, he said, indicated his illness is "highly curable," but he acknowledged, "With a diagnosis like this, it kind of flips your world upside down. But I got very good news about my marker."

Beecher, 21, a redshirt sophomore, played on special teams this season and had three tackles. He did not make the trip to San Antonio because of his illness. He said he told his teammates about it before they left. During the game, many of the players wrote his jersey number 43 on their arms or, in the case of wide receiver JJ Arcega-Whiteside, his neck.

"I was incredibly touched by the support my team showed," Beecher said.

The American Cancer Society says non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a cancer that starts in white blood cells called lymphocytes, part of the body's immune system.

Beecher's father, Jim, said Ryan will be examined by a Stanford oncologist Tuesday. "We're confident he'll be cured. He's looking forward to returning to football."

Shattered glass from a recent car break-in remains on the sidewalk on Bay Street near Kearny Street in San Francisco, Calif. on Wednesday, Sept. 9, 2015. Police officials say auto burglaries have doubled from last year, especially along Bay Street in Fisherman's Wharf, Union Square and the Embarcadero. less Shattered glass from a recent car break-in remains on the sidewalk on Bay Street near Kearny Street in San Francisco, Calif. on Wednesday, Sept. 9, 2015.

Vehicle break-ins have continued to soar this year in San Francisco, on top of already epidemic numbers, despite recent efforts by police to stop such crimes with more officers on the street.

Auto break-ins were up in every police district from the start of the year through the end of November, accounting for a 26 percent increase over the same period last year, according to the most recent data provided by the San Francisco Police Department.

At the same time, the rate of arrests for auto break-ins has dropped since last year from just below 2 percent to 1.6 percent.

From Jan. 1 to the end of November, San Francisco had 28,395 auto break-ins — about 85 a day — and already more than in any previous full year. The hardest-hit area was the Mission District, where car break-ins have gone up 86 percent from last year.

The latest data come after the Police Department decided in September to eliminate its 18-person citywide Patrol Bureau Task Force, instead assigning more officers to foot patrol in hopes of deterring criminals.

The different approach, however, doesn't appear to be discouraging thieves. At the same time, residents and visitors have become more aggravated.

"I feel violated — it's a helpless feeling," 55-year-old Matt Dann said after pulling his Toyota pickup with a freshly smashed rear window into Auto Glass Now on Bryant Street in San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood.

Dann was in town from Ventura County visiting his girlfriend. He left his truck full of personal belongings, including his laptop and clothing, parked on Gough Street near Sutter Street overnight.

Remarkably, none of his possessions was taken. He believes someone may have happened on the break-in during the crime, spooking the crook off.

His girlfriend, Mitsie O'Brien, said seeing break-ins' aftermath near her home is nothing new. Every morning looking down Gough Street, she sees a river of pea-size glass shards in the gutters.

The car of another friend of hers has been broken into three times. She doesn't even call the police anymore.

"I guess they've got way too much to do to follow up on a smashed window," she said. "It's part of city living, I guess."

But for those who park on the street, the situation has gone from frustrating to infuriating. Even before this year, car break-ins had been exploding.

In 2011, the San Francisco Police Department reported 10,197 vehicle break-ins. That number rose to 26,040 in 2015 and to 24,624 in 2016. This year's record of more than 28,000 will be higher once break-ins from the holiday shopping season are tallied.

While the worst-hit area was the Mission, auto break-ins went up in each of the city's 10 police districts. In the Central District, which includes Fisherman's Wharf and North Beach, auto break-ins were up 35 percent. In the Northern District, where tourists' cars are often targets at the Palace of Fine Arts and Alamo Square, they were up 34 percent. In the Richmond police district, with Golden Gate Park as its southern border, break-ins were up 22 percent.

"There is a lot more work to be done, and we're definitely not satisfied with what the statistics are telling us," San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott, who took command in January, said Friday.

Scott has deployed uniformed officers to areas of the city that have the most auto break-ins, and those areas have seen a decline, he said.

"We know that it matters, when we focus and we deploy," he said. "The issue for us and the challenge is we can't be everywhere, and we just don't have that many officers to do that. The next-best thing is to deploy where incidents are happening."

But while the number of auto break-ins may dip in areas with heavier police patrols, the numbers are rising citywide, possibly indicating that criminals simply move to parts of the city with fewer officers.

Six weeks ago, Scott created a citywide General Crimes Investigation Unit. The 48-person team, including 13 civilians with the crime analysis unit, will look into auto break-ins, along with home burglaries, robberies and bicycle thefts.

"One of the things we continue to see is there are a small amount of people that do this for a living," he said. "They break into cars. They're organized. Oftentimes they transcend district boundaries and city boundaries." Auto break-ins are up 33 percent in Oakland this year and roughly 6 percent in San Jose, according to data provided by the cities' police departments.

Scott isn't alone in trying to stem the number of break-ins.

In September, the Board of Supervisors passed legislation requiring rental car companies to remind customers not to leave valuables inside their vehicles and to lock the doors. Another city law passed that month prohibits rental companies from displaying bar codes and advertisements marking them as rentals.

The break-ins have become so prevalent that they are already an issue in next year's election.

Nick Josefowitz, a BART board member and candidate for San Francisco Supervisor in District Two — home of the Marina and Pacific Heights — recently tweeted break-in data from the Palace of Fine Arts showing 439 this year and only three arrests. He's calling for more police and more accountability "for our entire criminal justice system."

With arrests in less than 2 percent of break-ins, he said, the Police Department and city don't have the information to tackle the issue.

"If we are going to develop a sophisticated response, we need people that can get to the bottom in a data-driven way and develop the appropriate response," he said. "If it's organized gangs or crimes of opportunity — I really feel we're making policy in the dark about this."

Until city officials can figure out how to deal with car break-ins, reminding people to guard their things will have to do.

"Don't let anyone see you put anything into your trunk after you park, because people are watching," acting Mayor London Breed said at a news conference Friday. "Try not to leave valuables visible in your car."

And for those who are ripped off, hopes of seeing the offender brought to justice probably won't ever be realized.

"Here is the statistical truth about car burglaries: Very, very few of them get solved," Scott said. "It's a pervasive issue. It's a real problem for us in the city, and we just have to keep working to get better at it."

If you're only going to watch one game today, make it the VHS of my family's 1991 Thanksgiving football game. But if you can't get your hands on that, settle in for Panthers-Falcons at 4:25.

I won't believe the Falcons are a non-playoff team until I see it. They had some issues with the transition to Steve Sarkisian early in the year, and at no point has this offense functioned on the kind of level it did a year ago. But the bad breaks they are catching are just absurd. It started with a couple near-misses, then a couple of drops. Then, last week in New Orleans, they failed to score any points from the Saints' 1-yard line twice, and a Marvin Hall drop turned into the Saints literally pulling an interception out of their ass. (Well, not out of, but pretty close.)

It's been that kind of year for the Falcons. And when they went to Charlotte in Week 9, they were the better team. The Panthers leaned on a series of gadget plays to move the ball (Statue of Liberty play!) and Matt Ryan just overthrew one open deep shot to Julio Jones, then Jones let a second one bounce off his hands.

The Falcons have stayed relatively healthy this season, their defense is fast, young and still improving, and the offense is oh-so-close on a weekly basis. I think they can make noise in January, if they can figure out a way to not let one get away at home against the Panthers on Sunday.

2a. Speaking of the Panthers . . . this season the MVP "debate" has been an annoying cycle of people touting "contenders" who can't objectively be selected over Tom Brady, then (as is the current state of discourse in this country) throwing a hissy fit when you point that out. Because somehow it's disrespectful to suggest someone is merely the second or third or fourth most valuable player in the NFL this season.

Brady is the MVP. Wentz would have been an interesting challenger had he stayed healthy and lit it up down the stretch (he might have even been the frontrunner considering Brady's shaky game in Miami). But at this point there are no other contenders, because to argue someone is a contender is to suggest that they could win. No such person exists. Some guys would be contenders had Tom Brady never been born. But he was, so they're not.

Anyway, during this ritual of throwing out names of guys who could finish second in the MVP vote, I'm surprised it hasn't come around to Cam Newton. We went through a Russell Wilson phase when he was on a hot streak a month ago, and he's since strung together three horrific performances that, if they had come in September, would have everyone asking What's wrong with Russell Wilson?

That's how Newton started 2017, with the Panthers rolling out a new approach on offense, asking Newton to get the ball out of his hands more quickly, and Newton spraying throws all over the field. He still misses the occasional layup that makes Panthers fans throw up a little in their mouths, but Newton has also been asked to carry an offense with no semblance of a running game behind a shaky O-line. He is their rushing offense now. The Panthers have won seven of eight, and during that span Newton has rushed for 484 yards, 16th-most in the NFL during that span, and 6.1 yards per carry despite a lot of those being designed runs rather than chunk runs on scrambles (though he is picking up chunks on those designed runs; four runs of 30-plus yards and two runs of 60-plus yards over the last eight games). And in the meantime, he's taking care of the ball (three INTs over last eight). He's a downfield passer operating an offense that has little in the way of downfield weapons. Oh, and before this stretch, when the Panthers still had Kelvin Benjamin, Newton threw for 300-plus yards and three TDs in wins at New England and Detroit. So if we're suspending disbelief in regards to the MVP conversation by ignoring the existence of Tom Brady, I think Newton has as good an argument as anyone.

2b. All that talk about limiting the hits Cam takes this season, and he's actually four rushing attempts shy of his career high (132, in 2015). It's better to burn out than fade away, I suppose.

3a. Swinging back to that Seahawks offense . . . the good news is that they made some history a week ago: Seattle became the third team since 1950 to have more penalty yards than offensive yards in a game and still win. The bad news is that, over the last three games, they rank 32nd in the NFL in total offense (228.7 yards per game, less than the Bryce Petty-led Jets and the Savage/Yates/Heinicke-led Texans). And those numbers were boosted by Russell Wilson Bortlesing Blake Bortles in Bortles' own backyards (in the Week 14 loss at Jacksonville, Wilson threw three interceptions as Seattle fell behind 27-10 before TD passes of 61 and 74 yards in the final 10 minutes salvaged the stat line).

It's an alarming turn of events for a few reasons. The Seahawks have an injury or eight on defense. But here's the main issue: A couple weeks ago my podcast co-host and bunraku omozukai (the book I'm reading with my 5-year-old includes a lot of material on Japanese puppetry) Andy Benoit wrote a piece highlighting the risk of inconsistency when your offense relies on Wilson's improvisational, out-of-structure playmaking (yes, even when you bake that out-of-structure playmaking into your system, as teams like the Seahawks do). There's inconsistency, but the last three weeks have been something else. It's been borderline hopeless for this team to find any kind of offense, sustained or otherwise. And at this point, there's no Marshawn Lynch to lean on, and the defense isn't in a position to carry them. They might get to the postseason—it will only take a home win over the Cardinals and the Panthers beating in Atlanta team that finds creative ways to lose games—but to do anything in January Seattle would need Wilson to elevate his game to a level he's never (and maybe no one's ever) played at before, at a time when he's in the worst slump of his career.

3b. A bit of history could be in the works in Seahawks-Cardinals: According to NFLPenalties.com, Germain Ifedi is one flag away from being the first offensive player to draw 20 flags in a season (since 2009, which is as far back as NFLPenalties.com's database goes). So, have your camera ready for the big moment. Though I wouldn't be surprised if they had some kind of on-field ceremony to commemorate the milestone, before the flag is sent off to Canton, of course.

4. Have you heard that Dave Gettleman drives a hard bargain? Well, it's true. Dave Gettleman drives a hard bargain. And the negotiations with Odell Beckham Jr. are going to be the best off-field drama of 2018.

Way back when Ben McAdoo was running this offense, Beckham was indispensable. McAdoo's offense is iso routes all the time, requiring receivers to win their battles without the help of being schemed open. Beckham was not only capable of winning against double teams, but he required a double on every snap, allowing the rest of the receivers (and they had some awful ones in 2016) to work against single coverage. McAdoo's system was a complete failure without Beckham; Beckham could have demanded a franchise quarterback contract plus three Hawaiian islands and the Giants would have had to either pay it or tear the whole thing down.

I'm not sure how far they can deviate from McAdoo's system if they're sticking with Eli Manning, but they at least have flexibility now. And if they think the history of occasional meltdowns is an issue, a breakup with Beckham might not destroy the foundation of this offense.

Of course, they're better with Beckham just like any of the 32 teams would be better with Beckham. You could argue that, at the moment, he's the most desirable non-quarterback in football. Beckham is 25, four years younger than Antonio Brown and nearly four years younger than Julio Jones. He won't get the biggest contract in the NFL because he doesn't throw the football, but he should get the biggest ever given to a non-quarterback. It will be a monstrous investment. And, for a team that now seems hyper-sensitive when it comes to locker room chemistry, it might not be an investment they want to make. Unlike a year ago, they now have a choice.

5. Davante Adams got his contract—it's on the high end but not outrageous (a reported $58 million over four years with $18 million guaranteed)—but I would have been interested to see what kind of interest he would have drawn on the open market.

Adams has come along nicely since his disastrous 2015 season, is still improving, and probably most importantly had Aaron Rodgers advocating for the deal to get done. I'm not sure Adams is the kind of guy who keeps opposing coordinators up at night though (not yet, at least). It's also a move that will force the team's hand with Jordy Nelson and/or Randall Cobb.

Green Bay can get out from under either of their deals, which are both entering the final year—according to OverTheCap.com Nelson carries a $12.55 million cap number in 2018, Cobb carries a $12.75 million hit. The Falcons spent a league-high $28.1 million on their receivers in 2017 (Green Bay was second at $27.9, by the way). With the Adams deal, the Packers would be devoting in the neighborhood of $40 million to wide receivers if they keep everyone on the books as is, which is the kind of thing you'd only consider if your three receivers were Antonio Brown, Julio Jones and Odell Beckham Jr.

Nelson will be 33 in May and disappeared after Rodgers' injury—I'm not sure there would be much of a market for him if he's cut loose, and the Packers might risk cutting him then re-signing him. But he's also been Rodgers' most targeted and most productive receiver over the past two seasons, so is it a risk they can take? As for Cobb, he has been relatively disappointing since his breakout 2014 season, but he's also a moveable chess piece type in an offense that lacks them (especially since Martellus Bennett skipped town). Adams' combination of youth and production made him the obvious choice to keep in Green Bay. But they're going to have to ask one (or both) of their veterans to restructure, and might ultimately have to make a decision on who is expendable.

6a. Good on the Bucs for keeping Dirk Koetter rather than pressing the reset button again. He was originally promoted to keep the offense on track, and while Jameis Winston is still too often willing to try to power the ball through the flesh and bone of opposing defensive backs, the positives still outweigh the negatives. Koetter has him in a good place. Here's a breakdown of the Bucs' real problems:

94%: The defensive side of the ball. They had zero pass rush in 2017, and they also couldn't cover anyone. That's not an ideal mix, and if ageless CB Brent Grimes retires or signs elsewhere this offseason, it becomes an even bigger issue. The easiest way to fix things would be by adding an impact edge rusher—easier said than done even with a lot of cap space and a high draft pick (unless Demarcus Lawrence hits the market it's a soft free-agent class and an underwhelming draft class for edge rushers). They could also come up with a more creative solution. Like a more blitz-heavy approach in 2018. It's not that hard. The Panthers, primarily a four-man pass rush for most of the last decade, went blitz-heavy under new defensive coordinator Steve Wilks this season and didn't have to blow up the roster or the scheme to do so. Like Carolina, the Bucs have the speed at linebacker to make it work. Or, Tampa could just accept they might be multiple years away from competing in a strong NFC South.

3%: As mentioned above, Winston forcing throws.

2%: The "team out of control" narrative. The Mike Evans cheap shot on Marshon Lattimore was trash, and he had a couple of sideline meltdowns but not anything that doesn't happen every 12 minutes in Seattle. Winston charging onto the field in protest last week was not a great look, just like it's not a great look when, oh, Philip Rivers or Tom Brady do something similar. My only real "sideline antics" concern with this team was an injured Winston picked a fight in that Saints game. (I don't want my quarterback, while not wearing a helmet, getting into it with a guy who is wearing a helmet. Your skull is prone to getting caved in, and if you throw a punch with your dominant hand you're at risk of breaking a bunch of little, tiny bones. It's no-win.)

1%: Dirk Koetter probably misses his old glasses.

6b. Looking at the free-agent class of edge rushers, my goodness, send your ideas for exciting new inventions to Demarcus Lawrence, because he is about to come into an obscene amount of money. (Demarcus, if you're reading this, my invention idea is a Christmas tree that decorates itself—no more gashing your hands on razor-sharp pine needles, no more concussing yourself with falling ornaments, no more shelling out thousands of dollars to "Big Christmas Tree." And also it has an alarm clock in it.) If Lawrence doesn't reach the market, teams in need of edge rushing help are looking at rolling the dice on Ziggy Ansah, the most talented edge on the market but a guy who hasn't produced consistently since 2015. Or go get a 30-year-old Adrian Clayborn, and hope that Chaz Green is willing to tour the NFL as his weekly opponent, Washington Generals-style.

7. Have you leaked to a reporter that you'd rather not play for the Cleveland Browns? Because it seems like that's the thing to do right now. A few months back there was smoke surrounding USC QB Sam Darnold potentially choosing to stay in school—SCHOOL I tell you!—rather than risk getting picked by Cleveland first overall. (Darnold says that's not the case, but he should play another year at USC because he's not ready for the NFL anyway, but that's a discussion for another time.) And now there are reports that Josh Rosen would rather play for the Giants than the Browns.

And it's all a bit absurd, because while surely no one is thrilled about ownership in Cleveland (and that's not changing,) the Browns are teeming with selling points. Perhaps most importantly: They have an offensive line. A good offensive line that, if Joe Thomas is 100% healthy and Shon Coleman continues to develop, could be very good by next fall. You're not going to get your pretty face smashed in playing behind this line. They have the running game to carry the load early for a young QB. They also have a ton of draft picks and a ton of cap space, and they no longer have Sashi Brown trying to live out his childhood fantasy of owning every pick of a particular NFL draft (I could keep letting the clock expire and then pass myself, I'd rule the world!). John Dorsey can and should be telling any QB prospect who is the least bit hesitant that they will not sit back and trust Josh Gordon and a talented-but-raw Corey Coleman as their only two options at wideout, that they're going to be in on guys like Sammy Watkins and Jarvis Landry if they're available. (And they also have a potentially very good pass-catching TE in David Njoku.) And if they do retain Hue Jackson, they just have to give assurances that he will never again run this offense the way he ran it in 2017, but instead dust off his old Bengals playbook. (That's a tougher sell, I'm not sure what you do about the head coach after what happened to DeShone Kizer.)

But mostly it's this: The bar is so very low in Cleveland. This franchise has one win in its last 34 games. Josh Rosen, if you win 10 games combined over your first two seasons as the Browns' quarterback, you will not be criticized and you might even be celebrated. However, if you push Eli Manning out of town and win 10 games over two seasons as the Giants' quarterback, you'll be on the back page of the Post with a headline like "Josh Loser." Or "Butt Rosen." Or "Josh Diarrhea-osen." (I'm no good at these, but you get the picture.) And Cleveland is a good city—I don't write that in a pat-on-the-head kind of way. It's a good city. You'll find people and things there that you enjoy, because like all cities they are big and among the many things they have are good things. Too cold? Half the cities in the league are too cold. New York is too cold. (I would know, I work there and therefore live near there, and right now it's 9 degrees outside. I had to put on pants in my own home. That's right, it's too cold to go pants-less in my own home. This is no way to live.) And if you take the Browns to the Super Bowl, you will own that city. You'll be the new LeBron. If it all goes wrong, whatever. Tim Couch is on TV. So is Brady Quinn. Johnny Manziel just joined the Ti-Cats. You'll be all right.

8. I know, everyone's upset about this James Harrison thing, and fine. Tedy Bruschi said on ESPN the other day that he wouldn't have been caught dead putting on a Steelers jersey if he was in a similar end-of-career situation, and that's good. It's cool that there are rivalries and players are invested in the rivalries.

But as for Harrison ruining his Steelers legacy . . . [audible sigh] C'mon. Harrison is a self-made man. He was undrafted, cut, and went to Europe before re-joining the Steelers, then rose from special teams demon (got his first Super Bowl ring in that role) to starting linebacker and then, for a three-year span, was the best edge player in football. His decision to freelance on the last play of the first half in Super Bowl XLIII led to the longest touchdown in SB history, a play without which the Steelers probably don't get that title. He's been let go by the Steelers on three different occasions. He's 39 and might be in the final season of organized football he'll ever play. Yeah, it would've been sweet if the Patriots offered to sign him and he showed up in Foxboro but instead of signing a contract went to the weight room, grabbed a 45-pound plate and threw it like a frisbee through the windshield of Tom Brady's Saturn, then walked back to Pittsburgh wearing nothing but sweatpants and a scowl. (Don't worry! In this scenario playing out in our minds Tom Brady wasn't in the car; he was in the break room microwaving his avocado Hot Pockets at the time and is unharmed and still very handsome.) James Harrison's legacy as a Pittsburgh Steeler is safely intact.

Source (1)The Guelph Storm gave the Soo Greyhounds all they could handle on Saturday night

It wasn't easy, but the Soo Greyhounds winning streak is still intact.

Jack Kopacka scored the shootout winner as the Greyhounds edged the Guelph Storm 4-3 in Ontario Hockey League action at the Essar Centre on Saturday night.

The win extends the Greyhounds team-record winning streak to 23 games in the process.

Kopacka was held off the scoresheet in regulation time despite some chances late in the game but scored the lone shootout goal.

"He's always been good in the shootout," said Greyhounds Coach Drew Bannister. "He shoots the puck real well and it's hard to read his release."

For the Storm, the game comes as a learning experience as the team continues to battle the London Knights for positioning in the OHL's Midwest Division.

"I'm proud of the way our guys handled themselves, especially after giving up a goal early in the third," said Guelph Coach George Burnett. "It wasn't pretty at times, but we blocked a lot of shots, we won more faceoffs than we did last week.

"We can learn some good lessons," Burnett added.

It was the third game in three nights for the Greyhounds, who got off to a solid start in the contest after struggling in a 6-5 victory on Friday night against the Flint Firebirds.

"We competed a lot harder than we did last night," Bannister said. "Guelph pushed hard and were physical on us."

Greyhounds goaltender Matt Villalta made 38 saves and stopped all three Guelph shooters in the shootout, including former Greyhound Liam Hawel to seal the win.

"Matty was good tonight," Bannister said. "We needed that game out of Matty with three games in three nights. Both goalies were excellent."

Anthony Popovich made 39 saves for the Storm and two of the three Greyhounds shooters in the shootout.

"He's been really good for us all year long," Burnett said. "He was well-tested. Some of the point-blank shots he had to stop at the end when we broke down were pretty impressive. He gave us a chance to get a big point."

Morgan Frost and Barrett Hayton had a goal and an assist for the Greyhounds. Tim Gettinger also scored in regulation time. Noah Carroll, a former member of the Storm, assisted on all three Greyhound goals.

Isaac Ratcliffe scored a pair of goals for the Storm while Givani Smith had the other goal in regulation time.

The Greyhounds, who improve to 32-3-2-0 with the win, will return to action on Jan. 4 on the road in Mississauga against the Steelheads. The game opens a three-game road trip for the Greyhounds.

The Storm will take an 18-13-1-3 record into action on Sunday in Sudbury against the Wolves.

Notes: Both teams were without players who are currently competing at the World Junior Hockey Championship in Buffalo. Conor Timmins and Boris Katchouk of the Greyhounds are competing for Canada while Dmitri Samorukov of the Storm is competing with Team Russia.

The Storm also played the game without forward Alexey Toropchenko, who was initially expected to play but was a late scratch due to illness.

The league saw four other games on the schedule on Saturday.

In Hamilton, Ryan Moore and Will Bitten had a goal and two assists each to lead the Hamilton Bulldogs to a 7-4 win over the Kingston Frontenacs. Matthew Strome added a pair of goals for Hamilton.

In Peterborough, Pavel Gogolev scored three times to lead the Peterborough Petes to a 5-4 win over the Ottawa 67's. Tye Felhaber scored three times for the 67's.

In Saginaw, Blade Jenkins had a goal and two assists as the Saginaw Spirit beat the Flint Firebirds 6-2. Kyle Bollers added a pair of goals for the Spirit.

In Owen Sound, shootout goals by Aaron Luchuk and Ben Hawerchuk lifted the Barrie Colts to a 4-3 win over the Owen Sound Attack. Hawerchuk had a goal and an assist for the Colts in regulation time.Amr Hamroush hat Großes vor: Der Chef des Ausschusses für Religion im ägyptischen Parlament will künftig alle Landsleute bestrafen, die nicht an Gott glauben. Einen entsprechenden Gesetzentwurf zur "Kriminalisierung des Atheismus" arbeite er derzeit aus, hat Hamroush verkündet.

"Atheismus muss unter Strafe gestellt werden, weil Atheisten keinen Glauben haben und weil sie die abrahamitischen Religionen beleidigen", sagt Hamroush. Mit seiner Vorlage reagiere er auf die angebliche Ausbreitung des Atheismus in der ägyptischen Gesellschaft. "Wenn jemand die Religion verlässt, an die er geglaubt hat, bedeutet das eine Verachtung aller Religionen", argumentiert der Politiker.

Hamroushs Gesetzesinitiative erfolgt zeitgleich mit einer groß angelegten Polizeikampagne gegen Atheisten in Ägypten. In der vergangenen Woche verhafteten die Behörden den Administrator einer Facebook-Seite für Atheisten. Er wird angeklagt, weil er den Koran verzerrt dargestellt und beleidigt haben soll. Zudem nahmen sie den Social-Media-Aktivisten "Khoram" fest. Die Justiz wirft dem Mann vor, er gehöre der verbotenen Muslimbruderschaft an. Er selbst bezeichnet sich aber als Atheist. Wie ein Ungläubiger gleichzeitig Mitglied einer islamistischen Organisation sein kann - diese Erklärung sind die Ermittler bislang schuldig geblieben.

Das Gesetz öffnet der Willkür Tür und Tor

Viele Parlamentsabgeordnete und Mitglieder der Azhar-Universität, der wichtigsten religiösen Institution Ägyptens, unterstützen sowohl diese Kampagne der Sicherheitskräfte als auch Hamroushs Gesetzesinitiative. "Die Ausbreitung des Atheismus ist Ausdruck von Dekadenz und fehlendem Glauben und bedroht die gesamte Gesellschaft", sagt der Abgeordnete Mustafa Bakri. "Es ist notwendig, Gesetze zu erlassen, die Bürger davon abhalten, die natürlichen Instinkte des Menschen zu verletzen und jene zu bestrafen, die vom Atheismus verführt werden", sagt auch Mohamed Zaki, Chef des Obersten Rats für islamische Missionierung an der Azhar-Universität.

Offizielle Angaben zur Zahl der Nichtgläubigen in Ägypten gibt es nicht. Aber die Azhar-Universität bezifferte die Zahl der Atheisten 2014 auf exakt 886 - bei insgesamt fast hundert Millionen Einwohnern. Wie sie auf diesen Wert kamen, erklärten die Verantwortlichen nicht.

Auch ist unklar, wie der ägyptische Staat herausfinden will, ob ein Bürger an Gott glaubt oder nicht. Reicht künftig schon ein laut geäußerter Zweifel an der göttlichen Allmacht? Sollen Muslime bestraft werden, die im Ramadan nicht fasten? Was passiert mit Christen, die den koptischen Papst kritisieren? Klar scheint nur, dass das geplante Gesetz der Willkür Tür und Tor öffnen würde.

Minderheiten ohne Lobby sind ein leichtes Ziel

Nach außen präsentiert sich Präsident Abdel Fattah el-Sisi als Förderer eines Dialogs zwischen den Religionen und als Unterstützer eines "moderaten Islams". Doch er nutzt gleichzeitig jede Gelegenheit, um die Emotionen gläubiger Muslime und Christen anzuheizen.

Die Kampagne gegen Atheisten ist deshalb ebenso wie eine im November verkündete Initiative, Homosexualität offiziell unter Strafe zu stellen, vor dem Hintergrund der anstehenden Präsidentenwahlen im Frühjahr 2018 zu sehen. Das Regime fürchtet mangels glaubwürdiger Gegenkandidaten eine niedrige Wahlbeteiligung - das könnte im Ausland Zweifel an der Legitimation Sisis aufkommen lassen. Deshalb unternimmt man nun den Versuch, jede Stimme für Sisi als Stimme gegen Atheismus und Homosexualität darzustellen und die Menschen so an die Urnen zu bekommen.

Kleine Minderheiten ohne Lobby - Atheisten, Schwule, Lesben - sind für die Regierung ein leichtes Ziel. Indem das Regime sie als Gefahr für das Wohlergehen des Landes hinstellt, kann der Staat gleichzeitig von seinem Versagen in anderen Politikbereichen - etwa der Terrorbekämpfung oder der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung ablenken. Bislang scheint der Plan aufzugehen, der Umgang mit den Ungläubigen wird in den Medien breit diskutiert.Ronald Koeman is a good friend of Pep Guardiola, since they coincided at Barcelona under Johan Cruyff. The Dutchman has always shown his admiration for the Catalan, especially now as a coach.

Koeman told The Mirror: "People will say City are doing well because of the money the club has but that money is available to other coaches in the Premier League in recent years, but none of them have reached a football level so high and daring like Guardiola. We all know the coaches who have won trophies but they did not make the fans happy."

That can be perceived as a dig at Jose Mourinho, who recently complained about Guardiola's spending.

"Pep's philosophy is a victory for world football. He always wants to score goals, never goes out to defend. He pushes his players to the death to score, with full-backs pushing up and playing high.

"The football that Guardiola brings us is fantastic to watch and successful. It's the hardest way to have success in football. People think they have copied Barcelona but this style of football is more Guardiola'a DNA."Great day! Thank you alphabetman!!! My first ever ride on a TimberSled!

Cool! (Literally and figurativelySo tell me, how does this compare to a snow mobile?

The Cavaliers will be without Thomas for at least one more game as the team takes on the Jazz Sunday (AEDT), but their star player could play against the Blazers on Jan. 2.

Cavs coach Tyronn Lue gave some insight into some of the restrictions that Thomas, who has not played a game yet this season as he recovers from a hip injury, could face when he finally makes it back on the court for a game.

Lue said he will hold Thomas to playing only one leg of back-to-back games when he returns, according to ESPN. This means that if Thomas plays against Portland on Jan. 2, which is the earliest he could return, Thomas will automatically be out against the Celtics the next night. There is also the possibility that he will be on a minute restriction.

The former Celtics star would like to make it back for the Cavs' game against Boston, but he also indicated that it would be tough for him if he's not 100 percent.

"I don't want to play just to be out there, so, I don't know. ... That minute restriction, that would be tough to play in Boston on a minute restriction," Thomas said.Senior Brittany McPhee (#12 above) and junior Alanna Smith (#11, above) spurred the Cardinal on Friday against the Bruins. McPhee had 13 fourth-quarter points, while Smith recorded her fifth double-double in eight games. (BOB DREBIN/isiphotos.com)

Unranked for the first time in 16 years, Stanford women's basketball (7-6, 1-0 Pac-12) still managed to outlast No. 11 UCLA (9-3, 0-1) 76-65 behind another high-scoring performance from senior Brittany McPhee who put up 13 points in the final frame of the game.

Entering conference play, the Cardinal didn't exactly have the season start the way they expected: having played five top-ten teams in the AP poll in 12 games and losing its leading scorer McPhee to a foot injury for a month, Stanford had recorded its worst 12-game season beginning since the 1998-1999 season. Moreover, the Cardinal had dropped its last two home games, and was hoping to avoid its first three straight loses at home since 1985-1986, head coach Tara VanDerveer's first season on the Farm.

Despite these challenges, the team steeped up and was able to answer every UCLA scoring run with one of its own, eventually edging its conference rival.

"[We wanted this game] so badly," said McPhee. "We talked about it all week and were ready to go."

McPhee scored a game-high 26 points for the Cardinal, only a few days after dropping 27 on Tennessee. Junior Alanna Smith chipped in 14 points and 13 rebounds for Stanford as she recorded her fifth double-double in eight games. Sophomore Nadia Fingall also had a big game as she scored 10 points while contributing six points to the Cardinal's fourth quarter burst.

For the Bruins, Jordin Canada led the charge with 20 points, Kennedy Burke and Japreece Dean had 14 apiece and Monique Billings finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds.

Smith gave Stanford its first double digits lead in the middle of the second with a trey from deep, but the Bruins answered with an 11-2 scoring run to end the half and pulled back within three points, 32-29. During the stretch, Canada scored seven for UCLA, including a three pointer as time was expiring.

"[UCLA] can cut a lead in a matter of minutes," said McPhee. "We just wanted to be fearless, and that's what we did."

Early in the second half, the Cardinal entered a 14-5 run over six minutes to bring back their lead to double digits, yet UCLA managed to pull within one possession as the Bruins outscored the Cardinal 10-2 to close the third period, and Canada once again capped the comeback with a buzzer-beater.

The final quarter was a different story, ad this time the Bruins weren't able to climb back from the 10-point lead Stanford built behind McPhee and Fingall. The senior got things started with back-to-back treys before Fingall had consecutive baskets of her own from te elbow to put her team up 57-46.

UCLA cut it to three once again but McPhee responded with a three pointer. Defense eventually sealed the win as UCLA missed its last seven shots.

Stanford went 7-of-8 in the fourth quarter while scoring 13 points off 17 attempts from the free throw line.

The team now gets ready to host USC on Dec. 31 in Maples Pavilion.

Contact Alexandre Bucquet at bucqueta 'at' stanford.edu.In his original kettlebell book, Pavel Tsatsouline talks about a Program Maximum and a Program Minimum. For the younger people in the crowd (read: newer to kettlebells) some explanations may be needed.

The (R)evolution of the Program Minimum

The Program Minimum has it roots with the Russian communist coup. Here is a little background:

"The 1903 congress also adopted the party program, consisting of two parts: minimum and maximum. The two parts of the program corresponded to the two revolutions that Russian Marxists were to prepare for. The minimum program set the task of achieving a bourgeois-democratic revolution, in which the workers would aid the bourgeoisie to overthrow tsarism and establish a democratic republic. The maximum program planned for a proletarian-socialist revolution in which the workers would seize power from capitalists and establish the dictatorship of the proletaria." (courtesy of allrussias.com)

In the context of the home budget, the program maximum would include everything from food, housing, transportation, education, retirement, etc. The home budget program minimum would include only the minimum things needed for survival.

1. Water — Food

2. Shelter

Pavel took this minimalist concept and applied it to kettlebell training. While it would be ideal to have a more complex/comprehensive training program, many people do not have the means in both time and expertise to stick to that kind of training protocol. A Program Minimum with 100% compliance is much more effective, producing greater results than a complicated, time-consuming program with only 50% compliance.

The big question was: What drills would provide the biggest bang for your training buck?

Answer: 1 Grind and 1 Ballistic — Sculpted to Perfection

The original Program Minimum grind was the bent press and the ballistic was the snatch.

Many of us who started at the beginning of the kettlebell revolution grew up on a steady diet of this plan. However, it did not take long to realize that while these are great selections, for the average beginning kettlbell practicioner, these moves may be a little out of reach.

The bent press and the snatch demand a level of shoulder mobility that not many beginners have access to. Never one to rest on his laurels, Pavel reinvented the Program Minimum with two equally-effective drills: the swing and the get-up. With some instruction, most trainees can access the new plan without the prerequisites of the originals.

In Pavel's words:

"The Bent Press is an exceptional lift for an advanced minimalist — but most people simply do not have the patience to build up to it. The get-up, while missing out on some of the bent press's benefits, delivers a number of additional benefits. And, unlike the bent press, trainees of any level can benefit from it."

Simple & Sinister was born.

The following is a plan to combine both Program Minimums into your class structure and a way to ensure that even beginners can patiently develop the correct technique. This PM2 is scalable and can be taught in a group setting, even if the skills of the group members are widely varied.

What I am about to give you is a "one-stop-shop" template that will be appropriate for the rawest recruit yet challenge the most seasoned among your students.

Exercise Genus

While the full bent press, snatch, get up, or even swing may be too challenging for a newbie, there are drills that lead to the development of these skills that anyone can handle. The first thing we need to do is get a hierarchy of drills in the same family or genus as the target exercise. Here are my choices listed from easiest to hardest.

Program Minimum – Part A – Swing

SWING GENUS

1. Kettlebell Deadlift

2. Dead Stop or Power Swings

3. Two-Hand Swings (two hands, one bell)

4. One-Hand Swings (one bell, one hand)

5. Hand-to-Hand Swings

6. Double Swings

Program Minimum — Part B — Getup

GETUP GENUS

1. Arm-Bar

2. Floor Press

3. Naked Get-ups

4. Partial Get-ups (to a tall sit)

5. Tactical Lunge

6. Full Getup

Retro Program Minimum — Part A — Bent Press

BENT PRESS GENUS

1. Bent Arm Bar

2. Half Kneeling Bent Press

3. Low Windmill

4. High Windmill (bell in top hand)

5. Bent Press

6. Two Hands Anyhow

Retro Program Minimum — Part B — Snatch

SNATCH GENUS

1. One-Hand Swing

2. High Pull

3. Dead Stop or Power Snatches (touch and go)

4. Tempo Snatches (vary time in lockout)

5. Heavy Snatches (2-3 reps with a 5 rm size bell)

6. Double Snatches

This is my list. You may have others or you may think that a three is harder than a four, but that is not the point. The take-home lesson here is a list of six drills for each movement in the order from easiest to most challenging, and there is some room for interpretation.

One more point: If you are reading this and do not know how to do any of the above drills, you are required to find an SFG Certified Instructor in your area and get some lessons!

THE PLAN: MIXOLOGY FOR PM2

The plan calls for training four days a week.

Monday: PM

Pick 2 drills from the Getup Genus and 2 drills from the Swing Genus . Alternate between grinds and ballistics.

and 2 drills from the . Alternate between grinds and ballistics. Beginners should feast on a steady diet of 1s and 2s.

Intermediate Students should focus on 3s and 4s as well revisiting 1s and 2s

Advanced Students can play with 5s and 6s

Tuesday: Retro PM

Pick 2 drills from the Bent Press Genus and 2 Drills from the Snatch Genus .

and 2 Drills from the . Beginners focus on 1s and 2s

Intermediate 3s and 4s

Advanced 5s and 6s

Wednesday: Off

Thursday: Repeat Monday

Friday: Repeat Tuesday

Note to Instructors: When your new student has a good grasp on the 1s and 2s, then slowly introduce the higher level drills. They will have already seen your advanced members practicing them. So you will have some built-in retention.

To quote a student of Cole Summers SFG Team Leader and Former Team Canada Strength Coach: "Coach, when I master a new move it changes me completely."

TIMING

How much time or how many reps should you put in to each drill? You can play this by feel, but remember to vary the load from training session to training session. Or if you have a strong foundation and have learned all the drills in your list. then try what I outline below. It will add some randomness to your training and also a bit of fun.

I borrowed the following idea from an article Pavel wrote sometime back called ETK PLUS:

Get a pair of dice. Roll one die, this will determine your first drill.

Example: If you roll a 4 on swing day, look at the swing list and find #4, you will be doing one-handed swings.

Next roll both dice. This will give you the practice time.

Example: roll an 8 and you are working for 8 minutes on one-handed swings, shoot for about 80% effort.

Roll a die again and get a 6 and you will be working on get-ups.

Roll two dice and get a 4 and you will be practicing for 4 minutes.

Repeat the rolls again for your second swing selection and second getup selection.

We have had great success with this simple program and I am sure you will as well.

The issue first came to light about a year ago after Ginoogaming and Aroland First Nations launched a lawsuit and injunction motion against TransCanada, the federal government and the National Energy Board.

The two communities maintained that "integrity digs" by TransCanada along a 30-kilometre stretch of its natural gas pipeline would impact their treaty rights to hunt, fish, trap, and gather plants and medicines, as well as potentially damage burial grounds and other cultural heritage sites.

The company said at the time that the maintenance work was required to ensure safe and reliable service.

Although the First Nations decided to abandon their bid for an injunction against the work, they are now asking for a Superior Court declaration with respect to two elements of their Statement of Claim.

They want a declaration that the National Energy Act Regime is unconstitutional because "it purports to authorize actions, including pipeline operations and maintenance....that could have adverse effects" on Aboriginal or treaty rights without first requiring consultation.

They are also seeking a declaration that they are at least owed the duty to be consulted and accommodated about maintenance digs, even though the pipeline was built prior to that duty being enshrined in law.

Their request for summary judgment on these two issues is scheduled to be heard in Superior Court in Toronto in June. A motion for summary judgment asks a court to decide a case—before trial— in favour of the party making the motion.

A lawyer for the communities has said that if the motion is successful, the remedy will be compensation for damages.

The original lawsuit asked for $40 million in damages plus an additional $20 million in the event that the injunction to stop the maintenance work was not granted.In this op-ed, Jane Hartman Adamé explains why it's important to design menstrual products for disabled people, too.

Menstrual cups are awesome. They are better for the environment, save you money over time, and can be used for up to 12 hours continuously. However, they're not for everyone. And I mean that — they're not made for everyone.

Designing for women, particularly when the product is related to our sexual health, is challenging enough. Most inventors are men, and they tend to make things in a way that makes sense to them. How does that make sense? Now add in disability.

Disabled women have periods, too. And we deserve access to easy-to-use and well-made products that allow us to enjoy these amazing benefits. That's why I've been working hard to make something that works for as many people as possible.

I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a connective-tissue disorder that is characterized by joint instability. This means that when I do something like change out my menstrual cup, I can dislocate a finger, a shoulder, a hip, or something in my back. Not just can — I have done all of the above! I stopped using cups for a while, and it really bummed me out. I didn't want to send more tampons and pads into the landfill, but I had to prioritize my own body over the planet. That is not a fun choice to make.

My friend, who is a medical-device inventor, and I designed a menstrual cup called the Keela Cup, which we believe is much easier to use. With many traditional menstrual cups, tugging on the stem of the cup creates a suctioning seal in your body, which can pull your cervix (ouch!). So to remove it, you have to reach inside to push in the wall of the cup to break the seal. As you can imagine, this can be a tricky maneuver for a lot of folks, myself included.

We figured out that we could connect the stem to the top of the cup by having it pass through a seal at the bottom. This meant that pulling on the stem would break the seal at the top by folding it in, so now you could remove the cup as easily as a tampon.

This is a game-changer for me. With my chronic pelvic inflammation (my pelvis is the most troublesome part of my body with my SI joints and hips constantly slipping out of place), I am almost always spotting. Now, with how easy it is to use my Keela Cup, I wear it whenever I'm spotting even just a little bit. It's so easy to take out my cup that I don't feel it's a chore for me anymore, and I don't have to worry about it all day or night.

We've just launched on Kickstarter, and we have a lot of people sharing our product. I can't express how gratifying it is to see other people ecstatic about something I've made, including people who have been too scared to try cups. Even still, there are some folks who just don't get it.

One commenter on Facebook responded, "I think it's solving a problem that doesn't exist." Tell that to all of the people who are excited that they will actually be able to use this! It's this ableist thinking (if the problem doesn't apply to me, it must not exist) that has limited development in these fields for so long. If we allow the voices of our most challenged users to be heard, solving a huge problem for some can mean solving an inconvenience for everyone else. Inevitably, inclusive design benefits all of us. When we factor in the people at the extreme ends of use, we end up making something that is easier for the folks in the middle as well.

For me, Keela has been a project of empowerment. Rather than being embarrassed or quietly discouraged by the difficulty I had using other cups, I looked at the problem head-on and carved out a solution. When I first got my EDS diagnosis, I couldn't imagine what I could do for work with this body. I thought I was broken, and many days I still feel this way, but I now know I can use my disadvantages to make a positive impact.

Related: Everything You Never Knew You Should Know About Menstrual CupsThe demand for flights to nearly every major US city fell this year, providing further evidence that Donald Trump's presidency has put people off visiting the country.

Data from the flight search website Kayak found that British interest in four cities (Philadelphia, San Francisco, Orlando and Las Vegas) fell by at least 10 per cent compared with 2016, while demand for flights to a further eight - including New York and Los Angeles - dropped by five per cent or more.

The only US cities bucking the trend are Houston and Denver – neither of which could be considered mainstream options for UK travellers.

It adds to the weight of evidence that the incumbent US president is doing little to increase his country's appeal among holidaymakers – the fall in visitors has even been labelled the "Trump slump".

Just how bad is the slump?

Official figures show that this year, while international travel has been growing around the world, America's total overseas arrivals have fallen by 5.3 per cent year-on-year, while arrivals from the UK are down 6.3 per cent. This decline might not sound vast, but it is significant, costing the US economy up to £140m a week, according to the Global Business Travel Association.

Given Trump's efforts to ban citizens from Muslim-majority countries, it will be no surprise to learn that arrivals from the Middle East and Africa have plummeted furthest, by 30.2 per cent and 26.2 per cent, year-on-year, respectively. Mexico's residents also have good reason to boycott the US, and it appears they are, with a 6.1 per cent fall in visits.

Interest in New York has also fallen Credit: This content is subject to copyright./WIN-Initiative

The slump has also been profound in Eastern Europe (arrivals from the region are down 11.9 per cent), South America (down 13 per cent), Central America (down 10 per cent) and the Caribbean (down 13.8 per cent). Only the Asian market has not seen a drop.

For those still keen to visit the US, there's good news. The falling demand means cheaper airfares. Kayak's research found that average prices for flights to 13 of 16 key US cities had fallen by as much as 19 per cent.

Where are Britons going instead?

If fewer people are visiting the US, where are they going instead? America's neighbours, for starters. Canada, according to World Tourism Organisation figures, is anticipating a 6.7 per cent year-on-year increase in arrivals for 2017. To the south, Mexico is looking at a 9.9 per cent boom.

Kayak highlighted a surge in demand for destinations closer to home, too.

Searches for flights to Gibraltar, Toulouse, Paris, Hamburg and Krakow, for example, are all up by more than a third, year-on-year. It suggested Gibraltar's growing popularity (up 56 per cent, more than any other destination) was down to significant coverage in the UK media – the vote for Brexit reignited the debate about the status of the British Overseas Territory.

Beyond Europe, Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic (up 44 per cent), Manila (up 32 per cent), Delhi (up 21 per cent) and Casablanca (up 19 per cent) are also finding greater favour among Britons.

Several Australian cities, including Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth, have also seen a rise in interest, a trend that could be down to the ongoing Ashes cricket series.

Are other destinations suffering?

According to Kayak's research, demand has dipped sharply - by 38 per cent - for flights to Copenhagen. The firm suggested an increase in average prices of 63 per cent had contributed to the fall, along with competition from its Scandinavian neighbours.

Globally, the Maldives (down 43 per cent), Dubai (down 24 per cent), Kuala Lumpur (down 23 per cent) and Hong Kong (down 20 per cent) are also on the wane.

Where are prices rising and falling?

Besides Copenhagen, average prices have risen to several European destinations, including Milan (up 26 per cent), Zadar in Croatia (up 38 per cent), Dublin (up 33 per cent) and Corfu (up 39 per cent). They have fallen furthest for flights to Toulouse (down 49 per cent) and Hamburg (down 40 per cent).

Further afield, the cost of airfares to Osaka, Buenos Aires and the Maldives have risen, while to Vancouver (down 10 per cent) they have fallen.Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro accused Portugal of sabotaging Christmas as a shorage of pork led to anti-government protests spilling onto the streets.

According to Mr Maduro and his socialist government, the Portuguese authorities were pressured into preventing the delivery of two "giant boats" laden with government-subsidized ham, a favoured seasonal meat, due to an international conspiracy led by the United States.

"So, what happened to the ham?" Mr Maduro asked in a televised Christmas address on Wednesday after hundreds of people took to the streets in poor parts of Caracas on Wednesday night in protest at the shortage.

"We were sabotaged. I can name one country: Portugal. Everything was ready because we bought up all the ham there was in Venezuela, but we had to import [more] so I gave the order and signed off on the payments."

Some pockets of protests continued on Thursday morning, in what some social media users dubbed the "pork revolution".The Venezuelan president stressed that despite the bribes the Venezuelan officers have remained loyal to the Bolivarian Revolution. | Read MoreThe Venezuelan president stressed that despite the bribes the Venezuelan officers have remained loyal to the Bolivarian Revolution. | Read MoreHighly-detailed and full of little accessories, the pieces put out by Hawthorne Village are adored and collected the world over, and when the company touts itself as being "the premier provider of heirloom quality miniature villages," they're not just blowing smoke up their own butts. They truly are just that, and their exceptional pieces are quite literally like small-scale worlds come to life.

Primarily known these days for their ever-expanding Christmas collection, which brings the warmth and joy of the holiday season into millions of homes, Hawthorne Village also specializes in officially-licensed villages based on iconic pop culture properties like STAR WARS and NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS. And believe it or not, they once upon a time even delved pretty deep into the horror genre.

Beginning in 2004, Hawthorne Village began catering to the horror fan with the Village of Horror Classics Collection, a line of iconic horror movie locations that began with three locales based on the big three franchises: NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, FRIDAY THE 13TH, and THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE. The houses each included mini-figures of the corresponding horror icons, and the line soon expanded to included villages inspired by HALLOWEEN, DAWN OF THE DEAD, and even BRIDE OF CHUCKY.



Hawthorne's horror collection, which was an official partnership with New Line Cinema, was available on a subscription-only basis, and each piece was sold for three installments of $19.98. How it worked was that you'd send out the money and receive a new house every other month, and it was FRIDAY THE 13TH's "Camp Crystal Lake Cabin" that kicked off the whole thing in style. Individually hand-crafted and hand-painted, and equipped with hand-numbered certificates of authenticity, the light-up Village of Horrors pieces were produced in limited quantities and once they were gone, they were truly gone, which has resulted in all of them becoming quite rare, and very valuable, now over ten years later.

Not only is it very hard to find the pieces on eBay – at the time of writing this post, I see only four of them listed – but it's no easy task to even so much as find pictures of each of the villages. And more than anything, that's why I wanted to write up this post: so that there would be a place on the internet where you could check out all the horror movie locales released by Hawthorne Village, without doing any extensive digging of your own. You can thank me later. Or don't. You don't have to.

My research turned up a whopping 14 different Hawthorne Village of Horrors pieces, based on the six aforementioned franchises. So sit back, relax, and join me for a guided tour of those memorable horror movie locales!

Do you have any of these awesome pieces? Let us know!City Bar owner Brandon Hargrave incurred two debts in 2009 after purchasing the building that houses his downtown watering hole.

One was a typical bank mortgage for the $750,000 purchase of the building. The second note for more than $220,000 was payable directly to the sellers, for the privilege of taking over the bar permit attached to the building.

The Lafayette city-parish government had imposed a moratorium on downtown bars six years prior, but pre-existing bars were allowed to continue operating. Among a variety of unintended consequences were inflated lease rates and real estate prices in buildings that possessed the coveted bar permits. For Hargrave, this meant paying a 30 percent premium to complete the purchase of the building, which he said was difficult to appraise for a lack of comparable sales.

Success! An email has been sent with a link to confirm list signup. Error! There was an error processing your request.

"The building was worth X, but it had this special liquor license attached that made it more valuable," said Hargrave, who is hoping to reopen City Bar this spring after closing for renovations. "You could go anywhere else in Lafayette and get a liquor license, so you didn't have anything to compare it to."

The City-Parish Council is scheduled to vote Jan. 9 on replacing the moratorium with a new protocol designed to increase competition, albeit in a controlled fashion. The idea is to allow new bars on a case-by-case basis through conditional-use permits, that require obtaining separate approvals from the Zoning Commission and City-Parish Council.

These bodies would consider permit applications that include hours of operation, estimated capacity, parking plans and projected revenue, along with public input ahead of votes. Two major noise violations within a six-month period would result in automatic revocation.

"Right now, we don't have those options," said Councilman Bruce Conque, a vocal proponent of the proposed ordinance.

The ordinance is meant to give officials — and the public — more say over the types of bars that can operate while also affording that right to more people, Conque said. The longer-term goal is to enliven a downtown that is suffering from a depressed local economy, he said.

That won't happen without better security, including stronger enforcement of noise regulations, say business owners, realtors and city-parish officials. At present, night patrols along downtown's bustling Jefferson Street require overtime shifts, drawing from nearby precincts.

Noise enforcement is done circumstantially, and typically involves a conversation between a police officer and and bar manager, a volume adjustment and no further action.

Lafayette Police Chief Toby Aguillard says changes are afoot that will focus more attention on problems that arise with the downtown bar scene.

The department is hiring 10 new officers for a new "entertainment precinct" to cover downtown, along with the Simcoe and McKinley Street areas. The new officers will receive special training to deal with panhandling, drug use, proactive noise enforcement and other issues specific to downtown, Aguillard said.

The new precinct should be up and running by late summer, the police chief said.

"It's going to have a significant impact on downtown," Aguillard said.

Unintended consequences

The bar moratorium was enacted to freeze in place a downtown entertainment scene at the time that was generally considered vibrant, but also at risk of attracting illicit activity, sleazy proprietors and overwhelming crowds. Bourbon Street, or the reputation of it, was often cited as the example of what local leaders did not want to see on Jefferson Street.

But in some ways, the moratorium precipitated what it was meant to prevent, and officials could do little about it.

Bar owners wanting to open downtown had two choices: pay the premium rates in a permitted building or open a restaurant and verify to government inspectors that more than half of sales come from food.

"An honest businessman wants to build a business based on a pro forma, return on cost, investment risk," said Ryan Pecot, a Stirling Properties executive who compiles Lafayette commercial real estate data. "Not how much is somebody going to hold me hostage to get their license because I can't get one on the open market."

The most likely candidates to move into permitted bar spaces turned out to be fly-by-night operators who cashed in on a few nighttime hours of operation per week, said Geoff Dyer, chief executive of the Downtown Development Authority. The nightclubs remained closed most of the time, and other downtown businesses, including long-established, locally owned bars, suffered as regular foot traffic scattered elsewhere, Dyer said.

"It's almost like a cartel of the haves, the bars that have a license," he said. "Bad operators could get away with a lot more, just because there is no competition."

Today, there are approximately 10 permitted downtown bar spaces, some of which are occupied by stable operators. Others have been revolving doors for nightclubs with permissive attitudes toward criminal activity and failed concepts.

The City-Parish Council has been handcuffed along the way, Conque said. Existing bar operators, shady or not, are inherently entitled to run their businesses, so long as they maintain their right to sell alcohol.

Alcoholic beverage licenses are separate from zoning laws that regulate commercial property uses, including bars. Generally, repeated criminal citations on premises or noise violations are the only ways to strip alcoholic beverage licenses.

"We have very little oversight of what's going on downtown," Conque said.

The downtown retail economy, meanwhile, hit rock bottom one year ago by a variety of measures.

Taxable sales tanked while commercial vacancies spiked, both to their worst levels in recent memory, according to data compiled by Lafayette Public Schools, which is the parish tax collector, and Stirling Properties.

Commercial lease rates, which typically rise year to year, if only slightly in a tight economy, declined sharply below the previous year as 2017 began. More than 10 empty storefronts lined a three-block stretch of Jefferson Street on Dec. 16.

Lafayette's metropolitan economy shrank at the third-fastest rate in 2016, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The oil-price crash that began in 2014 undoubtedly drove the overall collapse in the metropolitan economy, but the bar moratorium has contributed to empty storefronts along Jefferson Street, said Ryan Pecot, a Stirling Properties executive who compiles Lafayette commercial real estate data.

Building owners with coveted bar permits "felt they had this value no one else had, so they wanted to run a tough bargain," Pecot said.

"Either they put a crappy tenant in that was month to month and ran a shoddy shop, or they said this is so important, it costs this, and you ended up with a boarded-up storefront because nobody was going to pay," Pecot said. "When you take away the open market, those kinds of things happen."

The depressing headlines and data did not stop the near-simultaneous expansions of two large, well-known New Orleans establishments to either end of Jefferson Street.

Dat Dog, a hot dog eatery with three locations in trendy parts of New Orleans, opened a 15,000-square-foot restaurant at 201 Jefferson St. last fall with a deluxe performance space in back. Rock n' Bowl, which, as the name suggests, blends bowling with live music, bought the old Whitney Bank building one year ago and expects to open in March, said CEO Johnny Blancher. Rock n' Bowl's total investment will top $3 million, he said.

Other businesses want to come to downtown Lafayette but are waiting to see how the new anchors fare, said Mark Van Eaton, a Beau Box Commercial Real Estate realtor who is marketing the vacant space at 209 Jefferson St., across from Dat Dog.

That was formerly the b.e.d. nightclub, which lost its alcoholic beverage license in October 2015 after three marijuana violations over two years. Beau Box bought the building seven months later as an investment property but is not interested in hosting another club, Van Eaton said. Among the prospects is a well-known New Orleans restaurant that has been looking at downtown Lafayette for three years, he said.

"They just can't pull the trigger yet," Van Eaton said. "We've had a number of other New Orlans-based restaurants that have looked at it. We've come close. Everyone is waiting to see what happens with Dat Dog. They are kind of the test product."

Asked if Dat Dog is meeting its revenue targets in Lafayette, Bill DiPaola, the chief operating officer, said it is "thriving and successful."

"We are definitely happy that we chose Lafayette; that is the best way I can say it," DiPaola said.

Dat Dog founder and owner Constantine Georges is the brother of John Georges, the owner of The Advocate.

The Dat Dog and Rock n' Bowl expansions to Lafayette come at different times in their trajectories. Dat Dog is blitzing across Louisiana and Texas, with new locations planned in Baton Rouge, Houston and College Station. The Rock n' Bowl on Jefferson Street, on the other hand, will be the only one outside New Orleans, at least for the foreseeable future.

Blancher was nonplussed when asked if he paused at the state of Lafayette's economy, as well as the downtown conditions.

Lafayette, and downtown in particular, filled subjective requirements that aren't measured in gross domestic product or employment stats. For one thing, Blancher said, "there is more in common with the psyche of New Orleans and Lafayette" than other cities in Louisiana.

For another, he said, the downtown in Lafayette is one of the few that can accommodate Rock n' Bowl's parking and square footage needs, at least in close proximity to home base. The alternative, suburban-style strip malls, aren't an option, Blancher said.

"We didn't want to be in an anywhere-America strip mall. It's just not who we are, it's not part of our identity," he said. "Downtown Lafayette, I'm sure, has gone through ups and downs for decades upon decades, but it's still here."What's next for N.O. roads in 2018? Here's how, where $427M in projects will begin

In 2001, after the 9/11 attacks, the United States invaded Afghanistan and quickly smashed the Taliban government. It also killed hundreds of members of the al Qaeda group that had launched the attacks, although leaders Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri escaped to Pakistan, along with about 200 followers. Ever since, we have been told that the U.S. military occupation of Afghanistan must continue indefinitely or else al Qaeda will return and make the country once again into a "safe haven" from which to attack the United States. In U.S. political discourse and news stories, this has often been stated as a flat fact, beyond dispute.

Last August, Donald Trump invoked the threat of Afghanistan as a terrorist sanctuary torationalize extending the already 16-year war indefinitely and increasing the U.S. military presence by at least 4,000 troops. The president cited the same argument heard since 9/11: "A hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum that terrorists—including ISIS and al Qaeda—would instantly fill." In his speech outlining the policy, Trump added that his government would not negotiate with the insurgency until some undefined point years from now. "Nobody knows if or when that will ever happen," he said. The implication was that U.S. forces must stay and fight indefinitely or the country will once again become a base from which terrorists can attack America and its allies.

This safe haven argument is a myth—a false but widely believed tale used to justify continuing a policy of perpetual failure. President Barack Obama often invoked this safe haven myth to justify his Afghan surge of 2009-2012, which moved some 60,000 extra troops into the country and brought the U.S. military contingent to nearly 100,000. He invoked it also to justify his decision to keep nearly 10,000 there through his presidency, thus reversing his promise to end the war. The conventional wisdom insists that Obama's decision to temporarily pull troops out of Iraq led to the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) and its short-lived "caliphate" in western Iraq and eastern Syria. But in fact a much greater factor was the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq in the first place and Obama's later support for the violent uprisings in Libya and Syria. In Yemen, the war against al Qaeda and the eventual regime change and war against al Qaeda's enemies, the Houthis, have likewise increased the bin Ladenites' power and influence there.

But leaders of both U.S. political parties and major media outlets have supported these policies, and to justify that position they ignore the role of Iraq and Obama's post-Iraq interventions in exacerbating the situation. Instead, they say, the ceasing of intervention in any area causes matters to become worse.

But because of the Bush and Obama interventions since the 2001 Afghan invasion, the al Qaeda and ISIS safe havens are now all far from Afghanistan, in the U.S.-created "failed states" of Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Libya. Furthermore, terrorists don't need safe havens from which to strike. As we've seen in recent attacks in the United States and Europe, one or two men with rifles or a truck can do plenty of damage with no more preparation space than a rented apartment. Trump invoked the recent attack in Barcelona in his Afghanistan escalation speech. But none of those attackers had any direct tie to Afghanistan or any of the other major al Qaeda battle zones of the past few years.

The few dozen core al Qaeda members who survived the initial Air Force bombing campaign in Afghanistan fled the country by the end of 2001. They were a non-factor in the war against the Taliban regime, and at no point did they have major influence in the insurgency against the occupation that grew up in later years. If any did come back they would be irrelevant. Afghanistan is exile, as far as anyone can get from anywhere. It provides no special access to any Western target.

The September 11 hijackers, none of whom were Afghans, gained entry to the United States under regular tourist and student visas. The terrorists launched the attacks from Massachusetts, Virginia, and New Jersey. They had planned them in Malaysia, Germany, Spain, California, Florida, and Maryland. True, Afghanistan benefited our enemies in its distance from the United States, making it somewhat difficult for America to hit back against targets there. But by 2002 there were no targets left in Afghanistan to bomb. Al Qaeda's surviving members had fled to the neighboring state of Pakistan, an American ally.

Most of them spread from Pakistan to other parts of the region, planning further attacks in Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iraq, and Syria. According to former FBI counterterrorism expert Ali Soufan, those left hiding in Pakistan tried to set an example for others in the region, changing from "Chief Operators" to "Chief Motivators" for others seeking to join the war against America.

And yet the Bush and Obama administrations went to extensive lengths in pushing the ridiculous safe haven myth. They argued essentially that America could never leave Afghanistan because then the Afghan state would fail, the Taliban would regain power, and al Qaeda would be invited back into the country. Indeed, in the early years of the war it was common to hear the terms "al Qaeda" and "Taliban" used interchangeably as the government worked hard to conflate Osama bin Laden's group with Mullah Omar's government. But as Alex Strick van Linschoten and Felix Kuehn demonstrate in their book, An Enemy We Created: The Myth of the Taliban-Al Qaeda Merger in Afghanistan, the former Taliban leader couldn't stand bin Laden and resented the radical terrorist's threat to his fledgling regime, putting it in the crosshairs of the American superpower.

When the Washington Times's Arnaud de Borchgrave interviewed Omar in summer 2001 he complained that bin Laden was like a "chicken bone stuck in his throat, that he can't swallow or spit out." An Army War College study said that bin Laden had refused to swear loyalty to Omar other than through a deniable proxy.

When the war came, the Taliban progressively loosened its conditions for extradition. First, it offered to surrender bin Laden and his men to an impartial Muslim state upon receiving evidence of bin Laden's role in the attacks; next, it offered to turn bin Laden over to Pakistan upon being presented with evidence; and finally, once U.S. bombs started falling, the Taliban agreed to hand bin Laden over to any third country, even without evidence of his guilt. By then it was too late for the Taliban—but not for the lesson of the differences in the motives of these groups and the nature of their formerly uncomfortable, now non-existent alliance.

It bears repeating that fewer than 200 al Qaeda members escaped to Pakistan at the start of the war and thus could return to Afghanistan. Many of those have been arrested by police and spies, gone back home to pick up the revolution there, or were killed in the CIA's Obama-era Pakistan drone war. Iran also apprehended a significant number of Arabs who had crossed their border during the initial invasion; most of those eventually were deported back to their home countries.

To justify continuing the Afghan mission, the U.S. government invoked the safe haven myth to obscure the fact that, though a handful of al Qaeda's leaders had escaped, America had won the war. This small group of terrorists who had never managed to control their own county or district, much less any province or nation-state, were already dead, imprisoned, or had been driven out of the country, into further exile.

A limited mission, focused on Osama bin Laden and his few hundred men, could have been over by the end of 2001. Even Gary Berntsen, the second CIA officer in charge of the initial invasion, has conceded the likelihood of this. "The war could have been over pretty quickly," he told reporter Michael Hirsh in 2016, lamenting Bush's refusal to allow the Rangers and Marines to reinforce the CIA and Delta Force in their attempt to kill bin Laden at Tora Bora in December 2001. "We could have had the entire al Qaeda command structure had we done that. Also, the terrorism that metastasized into Pakistan might not have happened. It's impossible to prove any of this. It's a what-if. But, sadly, we lost the opportunity."

General Anthony Zinni, former commander of Central Command, agrees. Al Qaeda in 2001, he says, "was a band of maybe a thousand radicals. Yet we created an investment in this that was on a level of what we do for existential threats. Obviously, we were traumatized by 9/11. I don't mean to play that down. But this was not communism or fascism."

Instead of declaring victory and coming home, the United States expanded its occupation strategy—and its list of enemies. The former Taliban government, initially acquiescent in defeat, has been fighting America and its NATO allies for almost 15 years, adding allies in the Haqqani Network and other groups. These forces have fought America and its allies to a stalemate.

If there's a safe haven in the situation, it's Pakistan. But, aside from the mysterious longevity of al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri on Pakistani soil, the sanctuary provided by that country is for the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network—in other words, local Pashtun tribal fighters, not international al Qaeda terrorists.

During the debate over Afghan strategy at the beginning of the Obama administration, when the president wanted to focus on killing the last of the leaders of the old "core" al Qaeda in Pakistan with CIA drones, the military insisted on escalation. One story leaked to the McClatchy news organization emphasized the safe haven myth and accused the White House of "minimizing warnings" that if the Afghan Taliban retook parts of Afghanistan it would invite al Qaeda back in. In fact, there was no new intelligence estimate on that point. This was simply spin and conjecture by those who wanted to expand the war. Osama bin Laden was still alive and at large then, making the alleged threat of the return of old core al Qaeda to Afghanistan seem more urgent, though the danger was not any more real than it had been since 2002.

After Trump became president, he seemed reluctant to escalate the war. He repeatedly delayed his decision on the new Afghan strategy and forced his National Security Council repeatedly to refine it. The president reportedly displayed his skepticism by invoking the failure of the Macedonians under Alexander the Great, as well as the Soviet Union more recently, to pacify the local Afghan population. This indicates an ability on the president's part to differentiate between local tribal insurgents, fighting because our troops are on their front lawns, and international Arab terrorists intending to hit civilian targets inside the United States. In Afghanistan, the United States is fighting only the former.

But war proponents can always invoke the safe haven myth: we still must never fully cut and run, or who knows what might happen? What if al Qaeda attacks us again? In reality, there is no reason to think al Qaeda would come back to Afghanistan were the Taliban to return to power, especially considering the trouble they generated the last time around. When van Linschoten and Kuehn contacted representatives of the Taliban's Quetta Shura after bin Laden was killed in May 2011, the Taliban figures didn't seem to care in the slightest that he was dead or how he had died. "We are fighting for Mullah Muhammad Omar. He is our emir. We have never fought for Osama bin Laden. His death does not matter to us. We will continue with our struggle." In fact, al Qaeda did not have a single representative on the Taliban leadership's Quetta Shura council. Even before Obama launched his surge, a number of administration officials conceded there was no reason to believe that a Taliban victory would mean a return of al Qaeda to Afghanistan. These included Vice President Biden; Richard Holbrooke, U.S. special representative to the region; and John Brennan, then head of counterterrorism, later CIA director.

As the late war reporter Michael Hastings revealed, when Generals David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal and their allies were pushing for the "surge" escalation in 2009, McChrystal neglected to even mention al Qaeda in his initial report. It wasn't until Republican Senator Lindsey Graham reminded him of the importance of the safe haven argument that he began to frame the war in that way. It then became a major talking point until Obama finally relented and agreed to the surge.

Six months into it, CIA Director Leon Panetta conceded to ABC News that al Qaeda represented no serious threat in Afghanistan. "I think at most, we're looking at 50 to 100, maybe less," he said, adding that al Qaeda's main location was in the tribal areas of Pakistan. In fact, Panetta could not prove that there had been any Saudi or Egyptian mujahideen fighters left in the country for years, much less any real associates of bin Laden. But his concession should have been enough to cause a scandal: If "maybe less than 50" illusory al Qaeda fighters can keep us in the country indefinitely, is there any possible future context in which the government could declare victory over al Qaeda there, much less the Taliban? And if their presence was the reason for the war, why was eliminating them not the focus of the Obama escalation instead of the broader, obviously impossible, anti-Taliban, Pashtun-pacification counterinsurgency effort?

In December 2009, following Obama's surge announcement, journalist Patrick Cockburn explained that the Afghan occupation, far from preventing terrorist attacks by denying our antagonists safe-haven, actually increased the likelihood of attacks in Western countries. Just a month before, a U.S. Army major named Nidal Hasan, set to deploy to Afghanistan and upset about reports of U.S. war crimes against civilians there and the prospect of having to kill fellow Muslims, killed 13 soldiers and wounded more than 30 in a massacre at Fort Hood, Texas. It was later revealed that Hasan had been in contact with prominent American al Qaeda preacher Anwar al-Awlaki.

Obama officials, insisting they had won the terror war and denying that blowback from U.S. policies had spurred this "lone wolf" attack, tried to spin the tragedy as "workplace violence," as though Hassan had simply "gone postal." But this was not truly "blowback," defined as long-term consequences of secret foreign policies returning to haunt the United States, surprising the population and leaving them vulnerable to misinformation about the conflict. A more accurate way to identify this phenomenon would be to call it "backdraft," when the direct consequences of the government's openly declared foreign policies blow up right in all of our faces, undeniable to anyone but the most committed war hawks. This is borrowed from the term used by firefighters for when their ax-wielding or door-kicking intervention inadvertently provides oxygen to a heated and fuel-filled room, causing a massive explosion.

In recent years, American domestic terrorists Najibullah Zazi (New York subway plot), Faisal Shahzad (attempted Times Square bomber), Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (Boston Marathon bombing), Omar Mateen (Orlando nightclub slaughter), Ahmad Khan Rahami (New York, New Jersey sidewalk bomber), and Amor M. Ftouhi (Flint, Michigan stabbing) have all cited America's Afghan war as at least partial motivation for their attacks and attempted attacks on U.S. targets.

In 2013, former Marine sergeant Thomas Gibbons-Neff wrote in the Washington Post that, after the Boston Marathon bombing, he rejected the safe haven myth and the concept that we must "fight them over there so we don't have to fight them here." He explained: "While I was deployed, I went to bed at night believing that I was protecting the homeland because coming after me and my fellow Marines was a much easier commute for those so hell-bent on killing Americans. But that argument no longer makes sense if my war has inspired enemies at home."

Osama bin Laden is dead, and the war has been generating backdraft terrorist attacks against the United States. But haven't you heard? ISIS is now in Afghanistan! Keep in mind, though, that ISIS is just a brand name. In Afghanistan, most of those who embrace the label are actually members of the Pakistani Taliban who fled Obama's drone war and the Pakistani military's infantry assaults back in 2010. They have now been joined by a relatively small number of former members of the Afghan Taliban as well—again, local Pashtun tribal fighters resisting rule from Kabul. For now, at least, these ISIS fighters are far outgunned by their Taliban competition, though U.S. Army and Air Force efforts in Nangarhar Province against those claiming ISIS's name have only made them more powerful over the past few years.

As Dutch reporter Bette Dam lamented, we are seeing the rest of the exact same dynamic play out with them as with the entire insurgency over the years: seeing this new threat, the Army and Air Force have launched a massive response. Since January 2015, the U.S. has bombed the eastern Nangarhar Province in an attempt to fight this small insurgent faction now claiming ISIS's name. As a result, "they are creating unrest, hopelessness and new enemies." The anti-occupation violence Dam predicted has continued to escalate.

After a Green Beret was killed fighting ISIS in Nangarhar Province in April 2017, the U.S. Special Operations Command took revenge by dropping a 21,000-pound MOAB, "Massive Ordnance Air Blast," on an enemy position. Since U.S. B-52s regularly bomb ISIS and Taliban targets—U.S. forces dropped more bombs in April 2017 than any other single month since 2012—the use of the MOAB in this instance seemed to be more about sending a message than anything else, though the military insisted the use of a fuel-air bomb was necessary to reach fighters hiding in tunnels deep underground.

The U.S. military then maintained that there were still hundreds of ISIS fighters left in eastern Afghanistan, giving the safe haven myth a new life. Never mind mythical al Qaeda leaders one day returning from Pakistan; now local Afghan and Pakistani Pashtun tribal fighters resisting the occupation and Kabul-based government, while declaring themselves part of ISIS, provide another enemy to fight into the indefinite future.

However, as expert Borhan Osman wrote shortly afterward in the New York Times:

Having been eclipsed by the Taliban, the Islamic State seems to be focused on marketing itself to potential and active jihadists. For that, it needs publicity. President Trump's big bomb provided exactly that. The destruction of a network of caves is the perfect advertisement to lure radicals undecided about joining a jihadist group and attract members from other groups. After the bombing and the subsequent military operations, the Islamic State in Khorasan's radio station in Nangarhar has been roaring. One preacher called the bomb a blessing from God....This is a message skillfully tailored for young radicals, since for them American hostility is a stamp of a group's credibility. The more a group is targeted by the United States, the greater its jihadi legitimacy.

Trump says he will achieve victory in Afghanistan, but he embraces the same failed and counterproductive policies that have served to increase the size and strength of the Taliban-based insurgency, Haqqani Network and now ISIS. And, while the government still invokes the hollow safe haven myth and insists it is defending Americans from Afghanistan-based terrorism, its ongoing war in that troubled land, with no end in sight, only puts Americans in greater danger.

While he'll never be independent, that doesn't mean he's not gaining some independence. ☺

Every single morning, Gavin begins his day with a bowl of oatmeal. He makes it all by himself and when he doesn't have chocolate chips to mix in, he simply cuts up an apple instead. He used a special tool we have that let's him safely cut up and remove the core of an apple. He doesn't use a knife, especially unsupervised.

My whole point here is that it's important that I focus on things like this because it's so easy to get wrapped up in the things he can't do. The reality is, there are a great many things he can do and I like to spend more time focusing on those things.

Anything he is able to do on his own is a form of independence. It gives him some autonomy and a feeling of pride. I think it's amazing that he's able to do some of the things he can, even though in many cases, the deck is stacked against him.

The list of things he can do for himself may never be as long as the other, but every one of those things on his can do list is something to be proud of, and I assure you, I am. I make sure he knows I'm proud of him and that's a good feeling for all involved. ☺







As we enter the new year, everyone is going through the old tradition of making resolutions and goals, only to later not follow through on any of them.

According to Derek Sivers, part of the problem is we blabber about our goals too much. When we tell people what we want to do, and they acknowledge it, this changes our "social reality." It feels as though we have already achieved that goal, even though – in the real world – we haven't yet done any of the necessary work.

It turns out this phenomena has been known for almost a century now. In 1926, Kurt Lewin, founder of social psychology, called it "substitution." In 1933, Wera Mahler found that when our goals are acknowledged by others they feel more real in our minds. In 1982, Peter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about the phenomena, and in 2009 he did several new studies.

In the studies, Gollwitzer gathered 163 people across 4 separate tests. He had everyone write down a personal goal, and then half of them announced their commitment to the goal to the room, while the other half didn't.

Then, everyone was given 45 minutes of work that would directly lead them closer to achieving their goal. They were also told they could stop working at anytime.

Those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire 45 minutes (on average), and still thought they had a lot more work to do after they left. However, those who announced their goals to the room only worked for 33 minutes (on average) and later said they felt much closer to achieving their goal.



How can we avoid this false sense of achievement?

Derek Sivers recommends that we keep our goals to ourselves, or share our goals in a less satisfying way. You could say something like, "I need to run this marathon so I need to train 5 times a week, and kick my ass if I don't." By acknowledging the hard work you need to do, you won't be so easily content with just sharing your goal. Also, your friends and family can you hold you more accountable.

So while trying to achieve your future goals, please don't mistake the talking for the doing. A lot of worthy goals take effort and dedication, and by acknowledging this reality we better equip ourselves for actually following through with what needs to be done (and not just imagining it).

Year in Review: President Trump's First Year in Office

An increase in America's prosperity and renewed respect around the world

President Donald Trump's first year in office can perhaps be best summed up with a promise he made during his inaugural address.

"We are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people," Trump said.

This belief—that power belongs to the people—has been a guiding thread through his presidency so far.

Trump has sharply decreased government regulation, while simultaneously seeking to empower Americans with more wealth and independence.

He has promoted Americans' freedoms and basic rights, such as religious freedom, and worked to bring the government back in line with the powers given it by the Constitution.

The strategy is working: Unemployment levels are now the lowest since 2000; the stock market is breaking record after record; consumer confidence is at a 17-year-high; and GDP (gross domestic product) growth is at 3 percent, a mark that some economists had recently considered unattainable. With the passing of the tax reform bill this month, economic growth is expected to accelerate even further.

The administration has worked to secure America's borders while simultaneously going after the violent MS-13 gang.

On the world stage, Trump has reasserted America's position as a moral leader and defender of human rights.

He has made it clear that America will no longer accept massive trade imbalances that have hurt American workers and businesses for decades.

Trump has reaffirmed trust with existing allies, like Israel, and forged new alliances in the Arab world to fight terror financing and the spread of Islamic extremism.

He has forged a warm relationship with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, while at the same time taking a strong stance against China's trade abuses and theft of intellectual property.

In Congress, despite severe obstruction from Democratic lawmakers, Trump has seen the confirmation of 19 federal judges who are strict constructionists in their approach to the Constitution.

However, all of this has come at a price.

Those opposing Trump's agenda, including media conglomerates, politicians, and government officials, have actively sought to delegitimize his presidency. Media organizations have resorted to misleading and false reporting. Politicians and government officials have promoted an unproven narrative that Trump colluded with the Russian government to win the election.

However, whether Republican or Democrat, no other president in recent decades has pursued the reform and change of course in regard to the American people that Trump has.

What follows is an overview of some of the president's accomplishments during his first year in office.



Trump Signs Sweeping Tax Bill Into Law

Trump signed his landmark tax reform bill into law on Dec. 22, delivering on his campaign promise to cut taxes before Christmas.

The new plan, which takes full effect in 2018, cuts the corporate tax rate by 40 percent, reduces individual tax rates, doubles the child tax credit, and nearly doubles the standard deduction.

It also eliminates personal exemptions; makes it less attractive to itemize deductions; limits deductions on state and local income taxes to $10,000; limits the mortgage interest deduction to the first $750,000 in debt; reduces the alternative minimum tax for individuals; and repeals Obamacare's individual mandate.

Tax reform is the first major legislative victory for the Trump administration and the biggest tax code overhaul since the Reagan years.

Following the passage of the tax reform, seven major corporations announced bonuses for their employees.

GDP Grows at Fastest Pace in More Than 2 Years

The key economic goal of the Trump administration is to stimulate growth, which was stuck in the low 2 percent range while Barack Obama was president. Trump has focused on a goal of a sustained 3 percent or higher economic growth rate, to be achieved through pro-growth policies such as tax reform and deregulation.

The economy has already seen some positive effects from Trump's initiatives. In the second and third quarters of this year, the economy grew at an annual rate higher than 3 percent, beating estimates. The growth was powered by strong business spending. After years of underinvestment, companies are now confident and have started to invest in equipment and technology.

In the third quarter, the GDP expanded at a 3.2 percent annual rate despite the damage caused by hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Economists expect the strong growth to continue into the fourth quarter.

Unemployment Drops to Lowest Since 2000

During Trump's first year, U.S. employers have added nearly 1.7 million new jobs, and the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.1 percent, the lowest rate in 17 years.

U.S. manufacturers' optimism has risen to record levels, helping to create 159,000 new manufacturing jobs. Nearly half of manufacturers said tax reform would encourage them to hire more workers and increase wages and benefits, according to a survey conducted by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) for the fourth quarter of 2017.

In order to improve the labor force participation rate and fix the shortage of workers for skilled positions, Trump signed an executive order in June to reform education and workforce development programs. The plan intends to ease the regulatory burden on apprenticeship programs and integrate classroom learning with on-the-job training.

Trump also signed a memorandum expanding access to high-quality STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education, with a particular focus on computer science.

Tax Bill Repeals Unpopular Individual Mandate

The tax bill passed in December repeals the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.

The individual mandate was highly unpopular. It required taxpayers to pay a fine—either 2.5 percent of household income or $695 per adult and $347 per child, whichever was higher—for not having health insurance.

The scrapping of the individual mandate puts Republicans closer to a repeal of the ACA.

The act was built on a model in which healthy young people were forced to sign up for health insurance, or else pay a fine, to offset the costs of insuring those who were older or sicker.

Trump said he hopes that the scrapping of the individual mandate will allow for Democrats and Republicans to come together to draft new legislation to fix the health care system.

A Republican attempt to repeal and replace the bill in July failed, as three Republican senators voted against it.

Trump also signed an executive order in October aimed at lowering health care costs and providing millions of Americans with more options.

Since the passing of the ACA in 2010 by a Democrat-controlled House and Senate, the cost of health insurance has sharply increased. Last year, states across the country saw an average increase of 25 percent in health care premiums. In Arizona, the increase was as high as 116 percent.

Cutting Red Tape

Since taking office, Trump has pushed hard to reduce red tape. In January, he signed an executive order that requires two past rules to be discarded for every new regulation proposed.

His administration has canceled or delayed more than 1,500 planned regulatory actions since then. Instead of the two required, 22 regulations have been eliminated for each new rule. By cutting excessive regulations, federal agencies achieved $8.1 billion in lifetime net cost savings, which equals $570 million in savings per year.

The administration will continue rolling back regulations in 2018. Federal agencies will cut more than $9.8 billion in lifetime costs in the 2018 fiscal year, according to the White House.

Stock Market Sets Record Highs

The U.S. stock market took off under the Trump administration, as investors welcomed the administration's economic policies and its efforts to roll back regulations. And more recently, the market climbed to fresh highs buoyed by the tax reform bill.

Dow Jones Industrial Average index has soared nearly 30 percent since Trump's election in November last year, exceeding 24,000 points for the first time in its history.

The Dow recorded its best-ever first year under a new administration since 1945. The blue-chip index hit record highs more than 60 times.

The stock market's surge to record highs helped many people's 401(k) retirement balances rise as well. U.S. stocks added more than $5 trillion in wealth to the U.S. economy.

Consumer Confidence at 17-Year High

Economic confidence reached record highs under Trump. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index increased for a fifth consecutive month to 129.5 in November, remaining at a 17-year high.

Both consumers' assessment of current conditions and their optimism about the short-term outlook improved. The percentage of people who say business conditions are "good" and jobs are "plentiful" increased. The proportion of consumers expecting business conditions to improve and jobs to rise in the months ahead increased as well, while those anticipating fewer jobs declined.

Optimism in US Manufacturing at Record High

The NAM Manufacturers' Outlook Survey, which registers manufacturers' judgment of the current economic climate, recorded the highest annual average in its history in November.

Manufacturers saw a significant improvement in their activity in the last year, and they are more positive in their outlook this year compared to in 2016. Manufacturing leaders expect to see growth in sales, investment, and employment going forward.

According to the fourth-quarter survey conducted by the NAM, almost 95 percent of respondents said they are positive about their own company's outlook. Nearly 63 percent of respondents said business tax reform would encourage investment, and more than half said they would add more workers.

"It is the direct result of manufacturers witnessing a sea change in policymaking in Washington, D.C., empowering them to hire more, invest more, and build more," NAM President and CEO Jay Timmons said in a press release.

Gorsuch Appointed to Supreme Court

On Jan. 31, less than two weeks into the presidency, Trump appointed Neil Gorsuch, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Colorado, to the Supreme Court.

Gorsuch, 50, could serve for several decades on the court. His appointment returned the court to the status quo ante, with four liberals, four conservatives, and a right-leaning swing vote in Justice Anthony Kennedy.

Given the outsized role the Supreme Court plays in deciding how the United States is governed, appointments to the court are often considered the most important domestic policy issue.

With three of the nine justices being 79 or older, another seat could potentially open up in 2018.

In November, Trump added five more names to his list of potential Supreme Court nominees. Should a vacancy arise, Trump will choose one of the 25 people on the list.

White House counsel Donald McGahn said in November that Trump is choosing judges who are "committed originalists and textualists," referring to a legal philosophy that relies on the ordinary meaning of the language of laws and the original meaning of the Constitution.

Rebuilding America's Military

Building on a campaign promise to rebuild America's military, Trump signed the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, which has a $626 billion base budget, up from $523.9 billion in 2017.

While the act authorizes spending the money, Congress has yet to pass the appropriations bill to fund it.

The bill includes an overall increase in spending on the military and on the acquisition of new defense equipment. Among the budgeted expenses are F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, ground combat vehicles, and Virginia-class submarines.

The bill will increase the size of the U.S. Armed Forces for the first time in seven years. It also provides military service members with their largest pay increase in eight years, according to the White House.

Since coming to office in January, Trump has implemented a "peace through strength" doctrine, in which military readiness and power are used to discourage armed conflict.

"History teaches us that when you weaken your defenses, you invite aggression. The best way to prevent conflict is to be prepared, and really be prepared. Only when the good are strong will peace prevail," Trump said at the bill signing ceremony.

The bill is one of the first moves toward undoing a series of cuts made to the military budget in recent years.

Trump Declares Jerusalem Capital of Israel

On Dec. 6, Trump announced that the United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and will move its embassy there.

The United States has been required since the passing of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 to move its embassy to Jerusalem.

But though presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama all made campaign promises to do so, none of them followed through.

Trump, however, delivered on his campaign promise, receiving praise from Israel for the decision.

Trump said that it was "long overdue" and based on "a recognition of reality."

He said the decision did not reflect a change in America's position on peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. He also said that specific boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem are subject to final negotiations and that he is prepared to support a two-state solution if one is agreed to by the parties.

Addressing the Opioid Crisis

In 2016, more than 64,000 Americans died of a drug overdose. Powerful synthetic opioids like fentanyl are driving overdose rates so high that the death toll for 2017 is on track to eclipse that by half in some areas. Two milligrams of fentanyl is a lethal dose for a non-opioid user.

The Trump administration has made the opioid crisis a key focus, creating an opioid commission earlier in the year and declaring a national public health emergency on Oct. 26. The declaration included ways to increase access to treatment and imposed stricter requirements on opioid prescriptions.

The Justice Department set up a new Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit to identify and prosecute over-prescription of narcotics. The department took down an online marketplace hosted on the darknet, which had more than 250,000 listings of illegal drugs and toxins for sale at the time of the takedown. For the first time, the department indicted two Chinese manufacturers of fentanyl. More assistant U.S. attorneys have been deployed in opioid hotspots, and the DEA is expanding its programs.

But there is still a dearth of effective treatment programs, jails are full of inmates with crimes related to the opioid crisis, thousands of babies are being born addicted, and thousands of children are being placed into the foster system because of addicted parents.

Demanding Fair and Reciprocal Trade

During a 12-day trip to Asia in November, Trump rewrote America's relationship with its biggest trading partners in the region.

After years of severe trade imbalances, with other countries exporting more to the United States than they import, Trump demanded that trade be reciprocal.

"I will make bilateral trade agreements with any Indo-Pacific nation that wants to be our partner and that will abide by the principles of fair and reciprocal trade," Trump said at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit in Da Nang, Vietnam, on Nov. 10.

"We will deal on a basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit. We will respect your independence and your sovereignty. We want you to be strong, prosperous, and self-reliant, rooted in your history, and branching out toward the future. That is how we will thrive and grow together, in partnerships of real and lasting value."

America's largest trade imbalance is with China. While the United States exported $115 billion in goods to China, it imported almost $462 billion in goods, causing a trade deficit of $347 billion.

"We adhered to WTO principles on protecting intellectual property and ensuring fair and equal market access. They engaged in product dumping, subsidized goods, currency manipulation, and predatory industrial policies," Trump said.

During Trump's trip to Asia as well as other regions, he signed hundreds of billions of dollars worth of deals benefitting American companies.

Taking Care of Veterans

Trump delivered on a campaign promise in June when he signed the Veterans Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act.

The act is both imminently practical and highly symbolic. Veterans have complained for years of an unresponsive bureaucracy in the Veterans Administration (V.A.) that doesn't serve their needs, and whistleblowers who attempted to point out the problems have themselves been punished.

The act makes it easier to fire employees of the V.A.—encouraging greater responsiveness and accountability—and offers safeguards for those who step forward to point out corruption, abuse, waste, and incompetence. It is also a very public declaration to veterans that shortcomings at the V.A. will no longer be tolerated.

This act is one of 19 laws and resolutions the president signed that deal with veterans, along with one executive order and five proclamations.

These measures extend the Veterans Choice Program, which that allows veterans to seek private medical care; provides for third-party reviews of V.A. medical facilities; requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to report prescription data to help track opioid abuse; helps businesses develop apprenticeship programs; awards businesses for hiring veterans; provides grant money to help police departments hire veterans; makes educational benefits available for life; improves the process veterans use to make appeals about their benefits; and funds veteran programs and benefits, among other purposes.

Trump has taken a personal hand in care for our veterans. He spent Christmas Eve making teleconference calls to veterans stationed in Qatar, Kuwait, and Guantanamo Bay, and patrolling the Strait of Hormuz.

Dismantling MS-13

The viciousness of the transnational MS-13 gang, also known as Mara Salvatrucha, has placed it squarely in the administration's sights for eradication. In the 2017 fiscal year, ICE's Homeland Security Investigations arrested 796 MS-13 gang members and associates, compared to 434 in FY2016—an 83 percent increase.

The vast majority (more than 90 percent in some studies) of MS-13 gang members are in the United States illegally. Most are Salvadoran or Honduran nationals. The gang recruits from the huge flow of unaccompanied minors that come up from Central America and are then settled in places like Long Island, New York, and the Washington metropolitan area.

The Justice Department has secured convictions against more than 1,200 gang members so far this year, and the department has worked with Central American authorities to arrest and charge around 4,000 members.

In 2018, expect the Trump administration to continue what it started. Trump is also asking for Congress to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement, a Clinton-era settlement of a class-action lawsuit that requires the release of unaccompanied minors into American communities instead of detention, pending removal.

Going After China's Intellectual Property Theft

The annual cost of intellectual property (IP) theft to the U.S. economy could reach $600 billion, according to the IP Commission report by the National Bureau of Asian Research. And China accounts for 87 percent of all counterfeit goods seized coming into the United States. It is the world's top IP infringer.

On Aug. 14, Trump signed a memorandum to authorize U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to determine whether to formally investigate China's trade policies "that may be unreasonable or discriminatory and that may be harming American intellectual property rights, innovation, or technology development."

"For too long, this wealth has been drained from our country while Washington has done nothing," Trump said during the signing ceremony.

A previous Epoch Times investigative report revealed how the Chinese regime steals IP from American companies and universities, then sells products made with the stolen innovations back to the United States at largely reduced prices.

Trump Pulls US Out of TPP, Works to Renegotiate NAFTA

Just three days into office, Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a giant trade deal that had been negotiated by the Obama administration.

The treaty had not been ratified by Congress and so withdrawal did not involve any change in U.S. trade practices.

The TPP, if implemented, would have made American workers compete with lower waged workers in Asia.

Trump has said he prefers bilateral trade deals to multilateral deals.

During a trip to Asia in November, Trump said the United States is willing to "make a bilateral trade agreement with any Indo-Pacific nation that will abide by principles of fair and reciprocal trade."

His administration is currently also renegotiating the NAFTA deal with Mexico and Canada.

While NAFTA was promised to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs for Americans, critics say that NAFTA led many companies to relocate to Mexico or compete with Mexican firms on U.S. soil, leading to job losses and wage stagnation in America.

In 2016, the United States had a trade deficit of over $64 billion with Mexico and $11 billion with Canada.

Trump has frequently criticized the trade deal, saying he will terminate it if negotiations fail.

Enforcing and Reforming Immigration

Illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, transnational criminal organizations, the visa lottery, chain migration, and sanctuary cities—Trump is targeting them all as threats to national security.

The Department of Homeland Security has focused on enforcing existing immigration laws that had been only loosely enforced for many years. Illegal border crossings on the southwest border are down, with around 304,000 apprehensions in fiscal 2017, compared with 409,000 the previous year. Deportations are up 37 percent, mostly due to enhanced interior enforcement.

Trump has made headway with his promised wall ($2.6 billion in funding, plus prototypes built), as well as with placing travel bans on terror-prone countries.

Expect a very public battle over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) legislation, starting in the new year. Trump has given Congress until March to come up with a permanent solution for the almost 700,000 recipients who have been handed a temporary deportation reprieve by Obama since 2012.

Trump has said he will not consider an amnesty for DACA recipients unless his immigration priorities are included in the deal. These include a wall along the southwest border, stepped-up interior enforcement of illegal aliens, and a merit-based immigration system instead of family-based immigration.

Defending Religious Liberty

During his first year in office, Trump has taken a strong stand to defend religious freedom and the importance of families as the cornerstone of America.

"We stand united behind the customs, beliefs, and traditions that define who we are as a nation and as a people. George Washington said that religion and morality are indispensable to America's ... prosperity, happiness, and totally to its success," Trump said at the Values Voter Summit on Oct. 13.

"It is our values and faith that inspire us to act with courage and to sacrifice for what we know is right. The American founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence—four times."

Trump signed an executive order in May to promote free speech and religious liberty. The order underscores the importance that the founding fathers placed on religious freedom, and instructs the executive branch to "vigorously enforce federal law's robust protections for religious freedom."

The president has also vowed to repeal the Johnson Amendment, which prevents churches and religious leaders from engaging in politics.

He has also placed importance on the family as the cornerstone of American life.

"We know that it's the family and the church, not government officials, that know how to create strong and loving communities," Trump said at the summit.

Taking Human Rights Seriously

During his first year in office, Trump has proven that his "America first" agenda does not mean that America is not concerned with the rest of the world.

But instead of telling other countries how to live their lives, Trump has said he wants America to be a shining example to the world.

With America's prosperity increasing again, Trump is showing the world that a free and moral people can govern themselves better than repressive regimes.

Underscoring America's commitment to the importance of upholding human rights and stable societies, Trump signed an executive order on Dec. 21 that declared a national emergency to deal with severe human rights abuses and corruption taking place around the world.

In the order, the president said that rights abuses and corruption "have reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of international political and economic systems."

The executive order allows for the freezing of assets, within U.S. jurisdiction, of foreigners who have committed such crimes.

With his executive order, Trump is telling the world that America believes human rights and civil societies are important, and that the country is willing to stand up for them.

Renewing Key Alliances With America's Allies

Trump has made it a priority to reaffirm and strengthen America's bonds with its key allies.

During his first foreign trip, the president visited Saudi Arabia, a key ally in the Middle East.

Trump addressed dozens of Arab leaders and gained critical support from the Saudi royal family in combating radical Islamic ideology and the funding of terror groups.

The United States and Saudi Arabia agreed to establish a Terrorist Financing Targeting Center to counter terror funding. Trump also visited the newly opened Global Center for Combating Extremist ideology, which aims to counter the spread of extremism.

Saudi Arabia's commitment to reform was underscored in November when hundreds of high-profile Saudis, including 11 princes, were arrested in a sweeping anti-corruption purge.

Many of those arrested had ties to the funding of Islamic extremism, as well as ties to U.S. politicians and interests in major U.S. corporations.

Trump has also renewed America's commitment to Israel. During Obama's presidency, U.S.–Israel relations had deteriorated, especially following the passing of the Iran nuclear agreement in 2015.

"We do not have a greater friend than President Trump," said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in February.

During a speech in Israel during his visit there in March, Trump said that the United States was committed to helping to realize peace and stability in the region.

Trump also decided to renegotiate the Iran nuclear agreement to make sure that Iran would not obtain a nuclear weapon as it is currently scheduled to do by 2026, the year key provisions on uranium enrichment in the agreement are lifted.

ISIS on the Run

With the ISIS terrorist group losing control of most of its territory in Syria and Iraq, millions of people have been freed from its brutal control.

The terror group was driven out of its main strongholds, Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq, by U.S.-backed fighters.

Since Trump came to office, the U.S. military has intensified its campaign against ISIS, under Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.

With the loss of its strongholds, ISIS is now scattered, and the United States is working to prevent it from relocating to other weak countries in the region, such as Libya.

The terror group quickly gained notoriety around the world in 2014 when it took control over large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria, submitting residents to its control.

Trump said in October that the United States is now transitioning to a "new phase" in the conflict, "in which we will support local security forces, de-escalate violence across Syria, and advance the conditions of lasting peace, so that the terrorists cannot return to threaten our collective security again."

Remaking the Judiciary

The Capitol Building in Washington on Dec. 4, 2017. (Samira Bouaou/The Epoch Times)

With Senate confirmation on Dec. 14 of the appointment of James Ho to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, Trump set a record for the number of Appeals Court judges appointed during a president's first year, with Ho being the 12th. The previous record of 11 was held by John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon.

When Trump came into office, there were more than 100 vacancies on the federal bench, giving him the opportunity to remake the judiciary. Altogether, Trump has nominated 59 federal judges, and so far 19 have been confirmed, including Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, six district court judges, and 12 appeals court judges.

With federal court judges often deciding the most important questions in society—a role conservatives say has grown far beyond what the Constitution intended—appointments to federal judgeships are intensely contested, with none more so than Trump's nominees.

Observers have characterized the Democrats' attempted obstruction this past year as unprecedented. They have filibustered two dozen of Trump's nominees and used up to 30 hours of debate time per nominee in an attempt to limit the number of judges the president can succeed in appointing.

Ho, a former Texas solicitor general, fits the profile of a Trump appointee. At 44, he is young and, with a lifetime appointment, he will be able to serve for decades. He is conservative and a strict constructionist, meaning that he believes in applying the law as written.

Aiming for Energy Dominance

In remarks made in June 2017, Trump said, "My administration will seek not only American energy independence ... but American energy dominance."

Trump argued that America has been shackled by a psychology of scarcity that diminished quality of life and made America vulnerable to hostile, foreign regimes. In fact, the need for scarcity was based on a lie, he said. America has "near limitless supplies of energy"—including 100 years worth of natural gas and 250 years of coal—and these put the goal of dominance in reach.

By striving for dominance, America can ensure its prosperity and sovereignty, and it can unlock "millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in wealth," while helping provide energy security for America's friends around the world, said Trump.

Given the strong partisan divide in Congress, Trump has needed to pursue his strategy of energy dominance through executive orders and presidential memoranda in which he orders or instructs the bureaucracy, with two significant exceptions.

The Republicans in Congress were able to repeal a recent Obama regulation, the Stream Protection Rule, which the administration considers unnecessarily restrictive on coal mining. And the just-passed tax reform bill has a provision opening a section of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.

Using executive action, Trump has done the following: approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines; ended the moratorium on coal leases on federal land; opened large parts of the continental shelf to energy exploration; begun the process of ending the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era regulation that the Trump administration believes was meant to end coal as an energy source in the United States; withdrawn from the Paris Agreement; and approved new liquid natural gas terminals and otherwise encouraged the export of natural gas.

According to the International Energy Agency, the United States is on course to become the world's largest exporter of natural gas. Coal exports have surged this year by 55 percent.

US Withdrawn From Paris Climate Accord

Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, saying it would disproportionately hurt American businesses and workers.

"The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers—who I love—and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production," Trump said on June 1.

Under the agreement, the United States would have been forced to immediately comply with stringent limitations, while other countries, such as China, would be given 13 more years before they would be required to start reducing emissions.

Citing statistics from the National Economic Research Associates, Trump said that the implementation of the agreement could have cost as many as 2.7 million jobs in the United States by 2025.

"As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States—which is what it does—the world's leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world's leading polluters," Trump said.

Trump said he was open to renegotiating the agreement and that, in any case, the United States would be committed to being a leader in environmentalism.

"We will be environmentally friendly, but we're not going to put our businesses out of work and we're not going to lose our jobs," Trump said.

Opposing Iran's Development of a Nuclear Weapon

Trump announced on Oct. 13 that he would not recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but instead would seek to improve it.

Under the agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran temporarily stopped its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief and the release of more than $100 billion in assets.

However, after 10 years, in 2026, the agreement allows Iran to install thousands of advanced centrifuges, which experts say will put it on course to develop a nuclear weapon within six months.

"The clock is ticking down. We know when the trigger date is," Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said during a briefing.

Trump said that the United States will stay in the nuclear agreement for now while it tries to renegotiate part of the deal, or reach a separate agreement that addresses problems that the original deal did not cover.

These areas include the time limits on some of the restrictions and the fact that Iran's development of ballistic missile technology was not included in the nuclear agreement.

Trump has been a fierce critic of the agreement, describing it as an embarrassment to the United States and the worst deal he's ever seen. Tillerson said the Trump administration will take "a much broader strategic approach" to the problem.

Exposing Media Bias

Trump has made a point of forcefully rebuking the media for false reports on him, exposing like no other president has before the amount of fake reporting that's done.

"Wow, so many Fake News stories today. No matter what I do or say, they will not write or speak truth," Trump wrote on Twitter on Oct. 4.

Research by Pew Research Center published in October proved the media's reporting on Trump was significantly biased.

An analysis of more than 3,000 stories across 24 different media organizations during the first 100 days of the Trump presidency found that reporting on Trump had been the most negative compared to that on other presidents in the past 25 years.

The research shows that only 5 percent of media reporting during the period was positive. Sixty-two percent of stories were negative, and 33 percent were neither positive nor negative.

Since Trump won the presidency in November 2016, much of the media coverage has sought to question the legitimacy of his presidency, creating divisions in society.

Most media organizations reported extensively on the allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. However, many of the stories relied heavily on anonymous sources from within the intelligence community, resulting in frequent erroneous reporting.

One such story, published on the Feb. 15 front page of The New York Times, claimed that members of Trump's 2016 had repeated contact with Russian intelligence officials. The story was later debunked by former FBI Director James Comey.

During testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on June 8, Comey said it would be correct to characterize the story as almost entirely wrong.

"All of you know this. Maybe the American people don't," Comey said, addressing the Senate committee. He said when it comes to reporters writing stories about classified information, "people talking about it often don't really know what's going on."

Calling Out the Harmful Ideologies of Communism and Socialism

Trump has taken a strong stance against communism and socialism, describing them as failed ideologies that have harmed millions of people.

"The same failed communist ideology that has brought oppression to Cuba has brought nothing but suffering and misery everywhere and [in] every place it has been, anywhere in the world," Trump said during an Oct. 6 event at the White House celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month.

"Communism is the past. Freedom is the future," Trump said.

Communist regimes have killed more than 100 million people over the last century, according to "The Black Book of Communism," published by Harvard University Press in 1999. Other estimates, however, suggest the number killed by communism may be closer to 150 million.

Trump has reversed Obama's policies on Cuba that benefited the regime. Instead, Trump said that American dollars would not enrich the Cuban military and the Cuban regime, and that sanctions will not be lifted until all political prisoners and dissidents are released.

Trump also denounced the authoritarian ideology of socialism.

"We also stand with the people of Venezuela who are suffering under the ruthless socialism of the Maduro regime. We reject socialist oppression, and we call for the restoration of democracy and freedom for the citizens of Venezuela," Trump said.

The president also took his message directly to the world, exposing the failures of communism and socialism in his speech before the 72nd U.N. General Assembly in September.

"From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure," Trump said.

"Those who preach the tenets of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems."

Providing Hurricane Relief

Trump and his cabinet responded well in advance and with overwhelming federal support to the devastating hurricanes that hit Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.

The federal rescue and relief efforts were first praised by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, whose state was hit worst by Hurricane Harvey.

"I've got to tell you, I give FEMA a grade of A+, all the way from the president down," Abbott said at the time.

Trump was closely involved in the rescue efforts himself, providing the governors with disaster declarations and the federal funding needed to respond to the disaster.

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled to Louisiana, Florida, and Puerto Rico, and twice to Texas.

On his first trip to Texas, Trump brought several of his cabinet members, such as Linda McMahon, head of the Small Business Administration (SBA), so that they could meet and start working with state-level officials on the rebuilding efforts.

The SBA, as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), have been providing financial aid to those affected by the hurricanes.

In Puerto Rico, regular military troops and the National Guard were deployed to help reach people to deliver food aid after the island was hit by two devastating hurricanes, Irma and Maria.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is still deployed to Puerto Rico and is working on rebuilding critical infrastructure, such as bridges.

As of early December, FEMA had provided medical aid to more than 37,000 people.

Melania Trump's First Year as First LadyRep. DeSantis Destroys NY Times Papadopoulos 'Bombshell": It Conflicts with Previous Stories – No One Can Say This Under Oath (Video)

On Saturday The New York Times reported from Deep State leaks that Trump campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos set in motion the 'Russian collusion' investigation.

This was a surprising charge considering most analysts now believe it was the Hillary-funded phony Trump-Russia dossier that allowed Deep State to spy on the Trump campaign.

Papadopoulos was charged earlier this year and pleaded guilty in October of making false statements to the FBI. He wasn't charged with 'Russian collusion'. Papadopoulos was charged with making a false statement to the FBI because talking to Russians is not illegal. On Saturday the New York Times reported it was Papadopoulos and not the dossier that prompted the Russia investigation.

The entire premise was debunked Saturday within hours of the Times report.

On Sunday Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-CA) also refuted the New York Times Papadopoulos report.

Rep. Ron DeSantis: I think what they're doing be resisting but then actually leaking certain facts to the media. There was just an article in The New York Times yesterday where they're leaking about this Papadopoulos which actually conflicts with the previous stories and is not anything anyone can say under oath on the record to us. You look at that and say, "Ok you're not willing to answer Congress's questions under oath but you'll leak things to the media?" That is not the way this is supposed to work!

This is more evidence that the corrupt Mueller witch hunt should be shut down today.NYT 'Russia Papadopoulos Bombshell' Completely Unravels Within Hours of Publication

Fake News New York Times is doing everything they can to steer the public away from Hillary Clinton's multi-million dollar garbage dossier the Deep State used in order to spy on Trump's campaign. The fake dossier ultimately sparked the 'Russian collusion' witch hunt.

If the dossier wasn't used in order to obtain a FISA warrant, then SHOW THE PUBLIC THE FISA APPS!

On Saturday The New York Times implied Trump campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos set in motion the 'Russian collusion' investigation, not the Hillary-funded dossier.

Papadopoulos was already charged. He wasn't charged with 'Russian collusion'. Papadopoulos was charged with making a false statement to the FBI because talking to Russians is not illegal, yet he's what prompted the Russia investigation?

The fake news media is beyond pathetic.

Excerpt from the NYT fake news article:

WASHINGTON — During a night of heavy drinking at an upscale London bar in May 2016, George Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, made a startling revelation to Australia's top diplomat in Britain: Russia had political dirt on Hillary Clinton. About three weeks earlier, Mr. Papadopoulos had been told that Moscow had thousands of emails that would embarrass Mrs. Clinton, apparently stolen in an effort to try to damage her campaign. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear. But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians' role. The hacking and the revelation that a member of the Trump campaign may have had inside information about it were driving factors that led the F.B.I. to open an investigation in July 2016 into Russia's attempts to disrupt the election and whether any of President Trump's associates conspired. If Mr. Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness, was the improbable match that set off a blaze that has consumed the first year of the Trump administration, his saga is also a tale of the Trump campaign in miniature. He was brash, boastful and underqualified, yet he exceeded expectations. And, like the campaign itself, he proved to be a tantalizing target for a Russian influence operation. The information that Mr. Papadopoulos gave to the Australians answers one of the lingering mysteries of the past year: What so alarmed American officials to provoke the F.B.I. to open a counterintelligence investigationinto the Trump campaign months before the presidential election? It was not, as Mr. Trump and other politicians have alleged, a dossier compiled by a former British spy hired by a rival campaign. Instead, it was firsthand information from one of America's closest intelligence allies.

1) Um Maggie, [@maggieNYT ] hate to undercut your *explosive story* on origin of Russia Probe. But George Papadopoulos talking in May 2016, is likely about this *open and public information* from April 2016. https://t.co/t9qtqDoLdQ — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

Rep Ron DeSantis has asked for Obama-Comey FISA apps to be declassified. As soon as we know what prompted the FISA warrant, we will begin to understand the origin of the 'Russian collusion' witch hunt. The reason why the Deep State is fighting the dossier so much is because we all know it is the fruit of the poison tree as Tom Fitton says.

Rep Ron DeSantis said in a statement:

"We now know that the so-called Steele dossier was paid for by the Democratic Party in an effort to gin up negative information regarding then-candidate Trump. What the American people deserve to know is whether the information compiled by Steele on the Democrats' dime was used by the Obama administration to obtain approval to conduct surveillance against Trump associates. The FBI has stonewalled producing these documents for months and their production shouldn't be limited to closed door viewing by a small number of members of Congress. The Trump administration should immediately declassify all the documents used to obtain surveillance warrants against Trump or his associates."

Nice try, New York Times; certainly that 'report' took some of your precious time to produce, however; we will never stop demanding an investigation into the dossier.

The brilliant Byron York of the Washington Examiner asked some pertinent questions that further poked holes in the desperate New York Times article about Papadopoulos:

So: 1) If Papadopoulos actions drove FBI probe, why wait til nearly Feb 2017 to interview him? If done to keep probe quiet before election, why wait more than two months after vote? 2/4 — Byron York (@ByronYork) December 30, 2017

2) When did officials brief Congress about Papadopoulos? They briefed Congress about Carter Page in late summer 2016. 3/4 — Byron York (@ByronYork) December 30, 2017

3) Did officials seek a surveillance warrant on Papadopoulos? They reportedly got one on Carter Page in summer 2016. Did they try to get one on Papadopoulos? If not, why not? 4/4 — Byron York (@ByronYork) December 30, 2017

One add: Not saying Papadopoulos played no role. But questions about whether his part was so central in starting FBI probe in July 2016. — Byron York (@ByronYork) December 30, 2017

Guest post by John S. Roberts at Right Observer:

The NBA's Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr must still be upset that President Trump rescinded his team's White House invite after a number of players said they wouldn't attend a champions ceremony – as is customary.

Why else would Kerr claim America's 'core values' are 'under attack' during 45's presidency?

From Breitbart:

Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr has issued a call to action. The NBA champion player and coach believes our nation's "core values" are under attack, and that it's time for citizens to do more to fight "propoganda." Kerr told USA Today that he believes the principles which formed the basis for the Constitution are not safe. Specifically, Kerr mentioned former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, and a recent Twitter post in which she tweeted the preamble to the Constitution. Kerr said, "There's absolutely an assault on our institutions and on our core values as a country. [Yates] tweeted the preamble to the Constitution, which really sums up our country. And all those things are kind of under attack right now." Yates was fired from her post after she refused to enforce President Trump's lawful travel restrictions, aimed at protecting American citizens.

The Hill has more:

In September, the team was disinvited from the traditional White House championship celebration by Trump after star player Stephen Curry told reporters that he didn't want to go. "We believe there is nothing more American than our citizens having the right to express themselves freely on matters important to them. We're disappointed that we did not have an opportunity during this process to share our views or have an open dialogue on issues impacting our communities that we felt would be important to raise," the team said in a statement in September.

Kerr is highly paid, but obviously he can't buy a clue.

People like him should not be talking about politics.

They know nothing of which they speak!If the United States hadn't admitted my refugee parents in 1937, my family wouldn't be alive now.

So it means a lot to me that since 1980, the United States has saved 3 million more refugees from war and persecution and led the world in refugee relief. But I'm troubled by America's current wave of negativity about refugees.

When I remember my parents and their largely refugee friends, I remember their intense engagement with their new country. They were in love with it, puzzled by it, and passionately grateful for being lifted out of the hell that their former homelands had turned into. Were they made-to-order middle Americans? Not exactly. They complained about everything from ice in drinks to electric guitars. Some couldn't get used to hearing English at home. But they were patriot refugees to their bones. Why should we think any less of today's refugees?

Today, 80 years after my old folks arrived, it's on us to confront another peak refugee year.

Since 2013, world refugee numbers have grown by 50 percent, with Iraq, Syria, and sub-Saharan Africa forcing out especially numerous and ravaged populations, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. About 17 million men, women, and children have no place to go.

Think about it: that's as if the combined population of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston had no place under the sun.

SHAMEFUL LEVEL OF HOSTILITY

As a member of a refugee family, I'm ashamed to see Americans talk about refugees with uninformed hostility. And even more ashamed to see the president doing so. It's time to straighten out some wrong ideas about refugees.

Some people seem to imagine our country is getting inundated. They have the story backward:

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT

By State Department and UNHCR rules, about 1 million people are eligible for resettlement. Of of that number, about 28,000 refugees have been resettled in the U.S., far less than in 2016, according to U.S. State Department data.

If the number of refugees worldwide remains the same as in 2016, and if few refugees enter the United States for the rest of this year, the U.S. is on track to accept 0.2 percent of the world's refugee population — far less than the historic average of 0.6 percent, and lower even than the share admitted in 2001 and 2002, in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, according to the Pew Research Center.

What a puny response. And are we rallying to the need now? Just the opposite.

President Donald Trump already has signed an executive order to reduce the ceiling by more than half. His administration announced it will admit only 45,000 next year — the lowest cap since Congress passed the Refugee Act in 1980.

REFUGEES ALREADY ARE CAREFULLY VETTED

What have refugees done to deserve a slammed door?

Some people seem to think the word "refugees" refers to unsanctioned flows like border-jumpers, boat people or unaccompanied minors. Other people confuse refugees with asylum-seekers or political expatriates.

In reality, refugee immigration is a completely different matter. Refugees are a separate administrative category. People requesting refugee status are interviewed and vetted carefully and — to their distress — very slowly, at U.S. embassies, in many countries.

Some people seem to think refugees become drifters and moochers. That, too, is wrong. We can be proud that in the U.S., refugees usually arrive into communities able to orient them and integrate them.

CREATE OPPORTUNITY, NOT FALSEHOODS

The International Organization for Migration and U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement work with U.S. based voluntary agencies such as the International Rescue Committee or Church World Service to resettle refugees within the United States.

These voluntary agencies have offices across the nation, dispersing refugees across many states.

Once refugees are resettled, local nonprofits, such as ethnic associations and church-based groups, help them learn English and acquire job skills.

After several months, financial assistance from federal agencies stops and refugees are expected to be financially self-sufficient.

In a short period of time, most refugee households have employed members.

Some people think refugees bring terrorism. I haven't found crime or terror statistic reports that distinguish the rather small category of refugees from the mixed population of immigrants, but it's worth noting that the 2014 Secure Communities program, a George W. Bush-era program that recently was reactivated by Trump, led to detention of more than a quarter million immigrants with no observable effect on the crime rate.

Let's jettison nonsense about refugees. If Iowa's legislators, congressional representatives and senators seriously want to grow our population of ambitious, grateful citizens, one thing they ought to do right away is expand refugee opportunities. It's useful. And it would do the country honor.

I think of those ubiquitous pussyhats now as a pink portent to, if not exactly the dismantling of the patriarchy, at least the first steps in recognizing the uncomfortable, even abusive, conditions so many of us have been forced to cheerfully put up with in our working (and academic and extracurricular) lives.

As of this writing, the target of those millions of marchers – the U.S. grab-them-by-the-pussy President – has not been brought down, certainly not for crimes against women. But the cultural tide has turned, and it has been a beautiful thing to behold. How many of the millions of women who marched last January have their own #metoo story? Here's an educated guess: every single one of them.

It's an annual exercise, and one I enjoy: Globe Arts writers each pitch a Canadian we believe deserves to be declared artist of the year, and write an essay supporting our selection. This year, though, any maker of culture that came to mind for me was overshadowed by the movement that shook the culture itself.

The Globe's artist of the year: The runners-up

I tried to be clever: I pitched #shetoo (and #hetoo) as my artist of the year. But there was no need to make this fit into a formatted box. This was a year during which advocacy outmuscled and outranked art. Harvey Weinstein's power, Kevin Spacey's talent, Matt Lauer's ratings – finally they were deemed less important than the behaviour of those men behind the scenes.

The cultural takeaway from this year is not the most Oscar-buzzy film or the most binge-worthy TV series, but the courage of Rose McGowan, Asia Argento, Ashley Judd, Lupita Nyong'o – and so many others; the controlled anger of Uma Thurman; the hashtags of Tarana Burke and Alyssa Milano; the A-list disclosure powers of Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie. They did it not with their art but with their own voices and stories. The power of artists to effect change has never been so evident. It started with show business, took on steam and blew up into a revolution.

We're not done yet, to be sure. There will be more falls from shallow grace; more heroes to be exposed as creeps. But it is imperative that the fight extends beyond glitzy Hollywood (and the far less glitzy world of media). We must be equally outraged by what goes on in the insurance offices, military bases, assembly lines and hotel kitchens of the world. Oh, and the U.S. Senate.

A moment for Canada's role in this, too: Actor Mia Kirshner has been a force, with heartfelt writing about her own experience and spearheading a symposium on the issue (which was sponsored by The Globe and Mail). Ellen Page shared a horrifying story about comments made about her by director Brett Ratner during a cast-and-crew meet and greet as filming began for X-Men: The Last Stand. In Montreal, Just for Laughs founder Gilbert Rozon resigned after multiple allegations against him arose. Hollywood showrunner and producer Andrew Kreisberg was fired after sexual-harassment allegations; his shows – Supergirl, Arrow, The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow – are shot in Vancouver.

Certainly, the Jian Ghomeshi scandal helped get the ball rolling.

Also, I recognize my self-interest, but spare some kudos for journalism in all of this. It was the tenacious, careful and brave reporting by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey at The New York Times and Ronan Farrow writing for The New Yorker – and the support of their editors and employers – that first exposed Weinstein. And that has without question led to a cultural shift – long overdue.

I remember watching Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas hearings. I was in my 20s, early in my broadcasting career, and I got the message loud and clear: Speak out and you will be dragged through the very public muck, have your credibility questioned or worse – while the person you bravely point to as the source of your misery will be elevated to hero status. Many women of my generation watched the same hearings and got the same message. Thomas is still a member of the U.S. Supreme Court.

It is so encouraging to think of the twentysomething (and younger and older) women watching now; to think of the message they are receiving by the world's response – as icons and kingpins are toppled and victims and whistle-blowers are believed, finally. This is not okay. Speak up. We have your back.Theresa May is preparing a new year reshuffle that could see a number of cabinet figures losing their positions in an attempt to refresh the Conservative front bench.

The prime minister is said to be considering offering the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson a move to a Brexit delivery role based in another department, but he is likely to resist such a move.

May's decision to shake up her team comes after fierce disagreements within Downing Street about how sensible such a move would be.

Some of those around the prime minister, including her former chief whip, Gavin Williamson, have urged caution because of the ramifications of placing sacked ministers on the backbenches. Others could also feel aggrieved at being overlooked.

But May's chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, has received the backing of Williamson's successor, Julian Smith, about the benefits of promoting younger MPs.

Rumours circulating in Westminster include the idea of Justine Greening being moved out of education, with one source suggesting that she had sided too strongly with the trade unions instead of embracing Tory reforms.

The Sunday Times suggested that Andrea Leadsom could be sacked as leader of the House of Commons, and it also named Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, who ran May's leadership bid.

Greg Clark is liked by Downing Street but has not always impressed as business secretary and could also be in line for a move to another department.

Patrick McLoughlin is expected to be removed as party chair, with the immigration minister, Brandon Lewis, likely to be named as his successor.

May will also have to replace her ally Damian Green at the Cabinet Office after he was forced to resign for failing to be honest about pornography found on his work computer. The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has been suggested as a replacement, although perhaps without the title of first secretary of state.

Those who could gain promotions into the cabinet include Dominic Raab and Damian Hinds, and May could also be looking to promote Amber Rudd – as foreign secretary if Johnson does step aside – and Karen Bradley.

Other female ministers who may be in line for promotion include Anne Milton, Claire Perry, Sarah Newton, Margot James and Harriett Baldwin.

Reports suggested the chancellor, Philip Hammond, was safe, although there could be rumblings of discontent among Brexiters if May tries to move Johnson without a change at the Treasury.

Previous moves have been overshadowed by the desire to maintain a balance among remainer and pro-leave MPs, but some have called on May to stop worrying about the issue.

Chris Wilkins, who was May's director of strategy until the summer, said a reshuffle was important to show her current "position of strength".

"It has two purposes: to show the country the depth of talent there is in the Conservative party and to show the party is united and is a broad church that welcomes all views and opinions," he said.

"We need to stop asking ourselves where people voted on Brexit and just look for the best person for the job."

Minister suggests chimes of Gothic masterpiece could be used on ITV and BBC while London tower is silenced for repairs

It is a building of such majesty that Hitler is said to have ordered the Luftwaffe to avoid it so it could be shipped to Germany and reassembled, brick-by-brick, in the Third Reich.

Having outlived the Führer, Rochdale's splendid town hall is being put forward for a different honour – as a stand-in for Big Ben while its London clocktower undergoes renovation.

Jake Berry, minister for the northern powerhouse and MP for nearby Rossendale, has written to the BBC and ITV to suggest the bells of Rochdale town hall be used to tell the time on the networks while Big Ben is in surgery.

Berry has written to Tony Hall, the director general of the BBC, and Sir Peter Bazalgette, who chairs ITV, urging them to broadcast the Rochdale chimes "until Big Ben is back in full working order".

A challenge for John McDonnell: move the capital up the M1 | Jonn Elledge Read more

Rochdale's bells already play the same tune as the Westminster tower's, notes Berry, and so could slip seamlessly into the networks' routines.

In the letter Berry writes of a recent visit to Rochdale where he stood in awe of the Grade I listed Gothic masterpiece, marvelling at its stained glass windows, credited as the finest modern examples of their kind.

"During my visit, I stood at the base of the tower and, as the clock struck 11 and the tower bells rang, I was struck by their similarity to those I hear so often in Westminster and on your programmes," he wrote.

"I think, due to the building's national importance as a heritage site, it would be a wonderful opportunity if you would consider using these bells temporarily in your broadcasts.

"In addition, it would bring tremendous joy to the immediate community – and the whole northern powerhouse – to provide these iconic chimes, even if just for a limited period," he says in the letter, first reported by the Sunday Telegraph.



Many have enthusiastically supported the idea, including the BBC stalwart Gyles Brandreth. "Peal appeal! Totally back plan to have BBC broadcast the bongs from Rochdale town hall live while Big Ben's bongs are silenced," the Just a Minute regular tweeted.

Tony Lloyd, Rochdale's MP, said: "Just as Big Ben is iconic around the world, Rochdale town hall is a source of enormous pride locally, despite being largely unknown to the rest of the country. If Rochdale were to stand in for Big Ben it could make the whole country proud of our great architectural history – and what's more, put Rochdale on the back of every [HP] sauce bottle."

Play Video 1:37 Listen to Big Ben's bongs sound for last time before they fall silent – video

Richard Farnell, a local Labour councillor who recently resigned as council leader, started a Twitter poll gauging support. His followers were asked to vote on whether they thought Rochdale's bells would "sound reet gradely". They could also answer "Northern time, what's that?", "It'll set whippets yappin" or "It'll wake oop soft south" (the winner at the time of going to press).

Despite local support, Rochdale is probably going to have to seek fame elsewhere. A BBC spokesman told the Sunday Telegraph: "While the idea of using Rochdale's bells may have a ring to it, after considering various options we decided pre-recording Big Ben's chimes offers the most reliable and resilient option whilst the Palace of Westminster carries out its repairs."

Rochdale's town hall is no longer used as council headquarters but instead is popular as a wedding venue and tourist attraction. In recent years it has served as a backdrop for numerous TV shows, including the BBC dramas Peaky Blinders and Our Zoo.Steve White, stepping down as chair, says the society is thwarting progress of women and BAME people

Reform in policing is being blocked by members of the Freemasons, and their influence in the service is thwarting the progress of women and people from black and minority ethnic communities, the leader of rank-and-file officers has said.

Steve White, who steps down on Monday after three years as chair of the Police Federation, told the Guardian he was concerned about the continued influence of Freemasons.



White took charge with the government threatening to take over the federation if it did not reform after a string of scandals and controversies.

Critics of the Freemasons say the organisation is secretive and serves the interests of its members over the interests of the public. The Masons deny this saying they uphold values in keeping with public service and high morals."

White told the Guardian: "What people do in their private lives is a matter for them. When it becomes an issue is when it affects their work. There have been occasions when colleagues of mine have suspected that Freemasons have been an obstacle to reform.

"We need to make sure that people are making decisions for the right reasons and there is a need for future continuing cultural reform in the Fed, which should be reflective of the makeup of policing."

One previous Metropolitan police commissioner, the late Sir Kenneth Newman, opposed the presence of Masons in the police.

White would not name names, but did not deny that some key figures in local Police Federation branches were Masons.

White said: "It's about trust and confidence. There are people who feel that being a Freemason and a police officer is not necessarily a good idea. I find it odd that there are pockets of the organisation where a significant number of representatives are Freemasons."

The Masons deny any clash or reason police officers should not be members of their organisation.

Mike Baker, spokesman for the United Grand Lodge, said: "Why would there be a clash? It's the same as saying there would be a clash between anyone in a membership organisation and in a public service.

"We are parallel organisations, we fit into these organisations and have high moral principles and values."

Baker said Freemasonry was open to all, the only requirement being "faith in a supreme being". He said there were a number of police officers who were Masons and police lodges, such as the Manor of St James, set up for Scotland Yard officers, and Sine Favore, set up in 2010 by Police Federation members. One of those was the Met officer John Tully, who went on to be chair of the federation and, after retirement from policing, is an administrator at the United Grand Lodge of England.

Masons in the police have been accused of covering up for fellow members and favouring them for promotion over more talented, non-Mason officers.

White said: "Some female representatives were concerned about Freemason influence in the Fed. The culture is something that can either discourage or encourage people from the ethnic minorities or women from being part of an organisation."

The federation has passed new rules on how it runs itself, aimed at ending the fact that its key senior officials are all white, and predominantly male.

White said he hoped the new rules would lead to an end to old white men dominating the federation: "The new regulations will mean Freemasons leading to an old boys' network will be much less likely in the future."

White came to be chair of the Police Federation after Theresa May went to its 2014 conference and ripped into it. The federation had to decide whether it would adopt a package of 36 reforms, with May, who was then home secretary, threatening that if it failed to do so, it would be taken over by the government and forced to. The Metropolitan police federation was the only local body in the organisation, which represents rank-and-file officers, not to back a package of reforms.

In 2014 federation members felt the body that represented them was failing them and was distant.

White said the organisation had been turned around during his time in office: "We have gone from being almost irrelevant to being the trusted voice of the frontline and the service. I think we had an organisation that shouted and bawled about everything, which became irrelevant to members and risked being wound up."

White beat the Met officer Will Riches to the chairmanship via a coin toss, after the two candidates won the same number of votes. White, who had served as a firearms officer in Avon and Somerset, came into office promising to end a culture of drinking by federation officials using members' money.

White said more reform of policing was needed: "There should be future radical reform of the police. The 43 forces need to operate more as a single entity. We have to break down the political barriers caused by PCCs [police and crime commissioners]."

White has written a paper advocating a national body to drive through reforms and impose them on forces if necessary: "We need a new governance board at a national level to drive reforms to policing and make sure it happens."

The National Police Chiefs' Council's lead for ethics and integrity, the chief constable Martin Jelley, said: "While we recognise that there has been concern in the past around serving officers also being Freemasons, it is clear that concern over real or perceived threat to impartiality of this has decreased. Regular external scrutiny of the police service by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services has not raised this as an issue of concern.

"Strict guidelines require officers to declare anything which might be deemed a conflict of interest in their force's register of interests. If convincing evidence ever came to light which clearly showed that Freemasonry was adversely affecting the integrity of the police service then we would take appropriate action."She broke the solo record for sailing round the world, but now she is dedicating her life to an even greater challenge – saving it from the destructive tide of plastic pollution

Trophies from her past glories as a competitive yachtswoman are placed discreetly around the 16th-century building on the Isle of Wight, the base of Dame Ellen MacArthur'soperations today.

On a blackboard in one of the meeting rooms, the targets of a different passion are spelled out. From uncovering the scale of plastic pollution in the oceans to targeting the textile waste of the fashion industry, MacArthur, who in 2005 broke the solo record for sailing round the world, is dedicating her life to saving it.

Now 41, MacArthur dreamed of being a sailor aged four when living in landlocked Derbyshire, and saved up her school lunch money to buy her first dinghy.

The same single-minded drive to achieve her goals is clear in the way she tackles the dream that has consumed her since her early 30s: to help stop humanity using up the world's finite resources. Indeed, it is unlikely her new passion would have emerged without the experience of her first.

"There were lots of subconscious things that happened that I was quite unaware of when I was racing; there were things I would write in the log," says MacArthur. "I was racing round the world to try and beat the record, I was completely and utterly fully immersed in the record, I was thinking of nothing outside that ... but every now and then I would write something down.

"I remember quite poignantly writing in the log on the boat; 'What I have got on the boat is everything.' It really struck me that you save everything, everything you have, because you know it's finite, you know there isn't any more. What you have on that boat is it, your entire world."

Back on dry land, away from the intensity of racing, MacArthur began to process the thoughts she had on the water. Her newfound fame suddenly became an opportunity.

In the winter after the round-the-world race, MacArthur spent two weeks on an island in the Southern Ocean to film a programme about the albatross.

"It gave me time to reflect and it made me think even more deeply about resources," she said. "You see the empty whaling stations down there and you realise that was just a resource – they pulled out 175,000 of them ... and then there weren't any to pull out."

"The basis of my thinking was completely around resources. It was around the pure fact – stemming from what I had learned on the boat – that resources are finite. The more I learned, I just saw this as the greatest challenge I had ever come across. If we are using these resources in a very linear fashion we are going to use them up at some stage, and no one knows exactly when."

MacArthur realised that if she was to capitalise on her moment of fame, her days as a competitive sailor would have to end.

MacArthur researched how best to move away from the disposable economic model to one in which resources are kept in use for as long as possible, then recovered and regenerated into other products and materials. She decided to dedicate herself to acting as a catalyst for change – a task that required her single-minded attention.

"It wasn't like I was looking to stop sailing, I never thought I would stop sailing ever, ever, ever, no way," she said. "I would have argued 10 years ago I would be racing in 20 years' time. It was the hardest decision I have ever made to walk away, but I realised I was at a position in my life where doors had opened that I wasn't expecting to open and I could use that ... that now was the time."

I had no wish to stop ... but I realised I was in a position in my life where doors had opened and I could use that ...

Within two years of launching her foundation, MacArthur was presenting an analysis on the circular economy to the World Economic Forum. Seven years later, the team has grown from the yachtswoman and a couple of friends to a 100-strong staff on the Isle of Wight, where she lives with her partner and young baby. Today she still sails, but just as a hobby.

The foundation's groundbreaking investigation into plastics produced shocking findings: 95% of plastic packaging material – worth $80-120bn each year – is lost to the economy after a single use, and after 40 years of recycling only 5% of plastic is recycled into a similar quality item.

Perhaps the most devastating statistic was the finding that if plastic leakage is not quenched, by 2050 the ocean will contain more plastic than fish by weight.

MacArthur believes it is through global partnerships and "incredibly frank conversations" with industry that change will naturally come by proving that more money can be made from circular rather than linear economics.

"We are trying to change a system, not one business. We need to change the way people think, the way things are designed, the materials that are put into them," she said.

Her optimism is such that she believes change will happen through collaboration, and she has numerous leading companies, from Nike to Unilever, Google and Renault, as partners.

MacArthur is reticent about a more interventionist, polluter-pays approach, in which companies are forced to move to a less wasteful model through taxation, fines and charges.

"There are mechanisms to speed these things up, regulation or policy change," is as far as she will go. Even with plastic packaging, the material which, according to her research, is part of a system that is the hardest to change, she shies away from punitive incentives.

MacArthur says some companies are getting on top of the issue – for example, Unilever, which has pledged to make all plastic packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.

"It's shocking, its horrendous, it's getting worse not better ... but this is a systemic failure and we are trying to go back to the beginning of the pipe and stop that systemic failure through redesigning the system," she said.

"It is by working with these companies, with policy makers, with cities, with innovation to design bio-benign products – that we will tackle this. There isn't a company out there which wants to see its logo in the ocean or in a river."Elon Musk sells all 50,000 plain black baseball caps showing the logo of his tunnelling firm, the Boring Company

The inventor and entrepreneur Elon Musk has proved that he can do more than just build futuristic cars and launch space programmes, having sold out an entire line of 50,000 hats in just over a month.

The latest milestone for the businessman behind Tesla, SpaceX and a host of other tech companies came when Musk announced that every one of his "Boring" baseball caps had been snapped up.

The plain black $20 caps, emblazoned with the simple white logo of Musk's tunnelling firm, the Boring Company, will have raised $1m for the venture.

Musk, who had earlier, presumably in jest, promised to start selling company-branded flamethrowers once 50,000 hats were purchased, tweeted: "Hats sold out, flamethrowers soon!"

Elon Musk (@elonmusk) Hats sold out, flamethrowers soon!

Showing how far a concept could be iterated, Musk regularly announced new tweaks to the offering, including a free gift with every 5,000th hat sold: another hat, "signed by the delivery guy", according to Musk.

The not-very-limited edition hat, however jokingly marketed, has been a fundraiser for Musk's Boring Company, which is promising to revolutionise transport by building tunnels far more efficiently and cheaply than at present. Musk suggests much narrower tunnels could be built, for a tenth of current standard costs, supporting a network of vehicles on electric skates.

The company is planning to construct a tunnel parallel to Los Angeles's congested I-405 – conveniently also speeding Elon Musk's personal commute from his home in Bel Air to Hawthorne, California.

The hats maintain their presence on the homepage of the Boring Company, although now the would-be buyer is simply told that sales are complete, alongside the sign-off of Edith Piaf singing Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien.

Disappointed purchasers can find other Musk-approved headwear. SpaceX, Musk's spaceflight company, sells nine different caps in a variety of colours with prints ranging from the X logo to a slogan reading "Occupy Mars", while Tesla Motors sells six caps and one "liquid metal visor" for prices as high as $30.

Other firms have become almost as well-known for their apparel businesses as their actual products. Ferrari generates almost $500m a year in sales not directly related to its car business (although that figure does include sponsorship revenue related to its racing team).

While those companies also make and sell actual products, with Ferrari and Tesla's cars and SpaceX's rockets bringing in significant revenue, the Boring Company remains firmly in the R&D phase. One tunnelling machine is slowly linking SpaceX and Tesla's headquarters in Hawthorne with Hawthorne Boulevard, two miles to the west.

One respondent on Twitter suggested that, such is the level of fandom Musk and his firms inspire, "the Boring Company could sell the dirt they are tunnelling through and people would buy it".



Musk replied: "We will! At least, whatever is left over after we build the obelisks."Ever since his epic 19-second-long handshake with a visibly bewildered Shinzo Abe of Japan, Donald Trump's unusual handshake style has been under the microscope. The strange, jerky movement he deploys to dominate his counterparts has become something of a talking point. But the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, the latest world leader to meet the US president, has managed to neutralise the Trumpshake with a clever combination of timing, balance and controlBravo, Andrew Adonis: the final transformation of this mild-mannered policy wonk into battling anti-Brexiter is a fitting way to end a year no less defiant of prophecy than 2016. And rather a cheering one, as it happens.

In truth, the former Labour transport secretary and No 10 policy chief has been steadily morphing from bookworm to kick-ass over the last 18 months, his interventions growing more trenchant, his cerebral manner increasingly matched by a taste for action.

Adonis on Brexit: 'No mandarin backs May. Government has broken down' Read more

Yet his resignation as chair of the national infrastructure commission on Friday captured this evolutionary process in a single, splendid moment of political drama. In his letter to Theresa May, Adonis characterised Brexit as a "populist and nationalist spasm worthy of Donald Trump", described the European Union withdrawal bill as "the worst legislation of my lifetime", and accused the prime minister of "allying with Ukip and the Tory hard right".

The list of beefs is plentiful: in his interview with the Observer, he called for Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, to be sacked over the bailing out of Stagecoach and Virgin, presently contracted to run the East Coast line until 2023. He has been, as Rik Mayall would have put it, "pretty fierce" about avaricious university vice-chancellors, the "Frankenstein's monster" of tuition fees, Birmingham city council, the providers of 4G phone coverage, and much else besides.

But it is Brexit that has energised him and driven his public metamorphosis from the owlish curator of Roy Jenkins's legacy to an energetic activist campaigning for all he is worth to prevent Britain's departure from the EU. As he put it on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, this means "arguing passionately with the British people as to why staying in the EU is the right thing to do".

There are those who say that this is an intrinsically improper project. A referendum was held, a result declared, and an argument concluded. How dare "remoaners" continue to voice their opinions on a settled matter?

To which I am tempted to respond in words of one syllable – but will not, in deference to the festive spirit. Still, it is absurd to suggest that the vote on 23 June 2016 was the final and definitive statement on the UK's membership of the EU. It is the mark of a free society that debate continues, that dissent is not only tolerated but embedded in political discourse, and that political decisions can be reversed.

The overwhelming probability remains that Brexit will indeed go ahead on 29 March 2019 – as Adonis knows perfectly well. All the more reason, then, for those who regard this as a disastrous course to urge upon the electorate a change of trajectory.

For his part, Adonis calculates that the folly of leaving the EU will become ever more clear in the coming months, and that Labour's leadership may yet replace its five-sizes-fit-all position with one closer to his own. This persuasive enterprise may well be doomed – but so what? Do we really want our politicians to be a tribe of bobble-heads who long for nothing but a quiet life? True patriotism is often to be found in the courage to challenge majority opinion.

It does Adonis no favours, of course, that he hails from what is presently the least fashionable ideological postcode: the blasted heath of liberal centrism. This battered position has few, if any, defenders in the upper reaches of May's government; and the founding principle of Corbynism is that the Blair-Cameron era was a period of unmitigated national disaster.

To declare oneself a centrist these days is to invite fairly arbitrary denunciation as a "neoliberal" (or "neoconservative", take your pick), metropolitan elitist, Old Etonian, Old Mandelsonian, friend of dictators, ally of the banks, relentless privatiser, fox murderer, war criminal ... and that's just the vanilla stuff. Naturally, Adonis is an untouchable because of his close association with Tony Blair and his membership of the House of Lords. Never mind that he is the son of a Cypriot immigrant, and was placed in care until the age of 11: he ended up in the wrong gang, didn't he?

So it is easy for both Brexiters and the left to sneer at Adonis as an irrelevance from the past, beating his chest in desperation. Easy, but wrong.

For the unfashionable centrism that he incarnates is not defunct. True, it has taken a pasting, as the pathologies of globalisation have become ever more clear and governments around the world have failed to keep pace with the social cost. In consequence, technocrats have been bulldozed by populists.

The liberal fear is that identity politics will ignite a spitting cauldron of Trumps and Brexits

But much more survives of the liberal inheritance than is commonly supposed. At its root remains a still-precious belief in pluralism, and the conviction that a decent society thrives on both diversity and an agreed core of common principles. It prefers debate, free speech and ceaseless social interaction to safe spaces, no-platforming and digital cantonisation. Its more thoughtful exponents fret that a polarised politics based principally upon identity groupings – of left and right – will never truly favour the vulnerable, the dispossessed and the disenfranchised.

Rules-based systems are often tiresome, but they are preferable to unbridled political tribalism. And as the tide of populism spreads across Europe, the liberal fear is that identity politics will ignite a spitting cauldron of Trumps and Brexits.

The Europhobic right will never be reconciled to what Adonis stands for, or what he proposes to do. But those on the left who deplore him should pause for thought. Progressive politics rarely follows a script. Who, for instance, would have predicted that gay marriage would be legalised by a coalition of Tories and Liberal Democrats? Since the June election, the Labour leader and his acolytes have been quite clear that the triumph of the left and its arrival in government is now only a matter of dates.

Which it may well be. But history is not obedient. It squirms, wriggles and flounces when taken for granted. So – my friendly advice for 2018 – don't assume that the old alliance of left and centre-ground can be consigned for ever to the ideological dustbin, or confuse the exhilaration of political purity for wisdom. Don't assume, either, that the next election is won just because the last went well. Don't, in other words, sneer so readily at Andrew Adonis: you never know when you may need him. Happy new year.

• Matthew d'Ancona is a Guardian columnistNew Year's Eve marks the 50th anniversary of one of the most remarkable American football matches in history. A game that almost certainly should not have been played on New Year's Eve 1967, it remains as renowned for the hideously bitter conditions in which it was contested as its thrilling denouement.

The Green Bay Packers, managed by the legendary Vince Lombardi, were aiming to make history by becoming the first team in the history of the play-off era to win three consecutive NFL titles. Similarly venerated Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry and his men had the difficult job of stopping them. Up for grabs: the NFL Championship and a place against the AFL champions in the second Super Bowl. Still in its infancy and nothing resembling the spectacle that stops a nation it has since become, that particular decider would prove little more than a footnote to what has gone down in football folklore as the "Ice Bowl".

"A sell-out crowd has braved the coldest New Year's Eve in the history of Green Bay, Wisconsin, to witness the 1967 NFL Championship game between the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers," announced CBS colour man Frank Gifford in his scene-setter shortly before kick-off. "The mercury has dipped to -15F [-26C], with winds gusting at 18 miles per hour as we approach kick-off. That makes it the coldest game in league championship history."

Donald Trump has just started on his aim to be the only game in town | Bryan Armen Graham Read more

Despite the harshness of the elements, the crowd in question numbered 50,861, mostly Packers fans protected against the biting cold by parkas, woollen balaclavas and thermal underwear to supplement their usual duds, with many wrapped in sleeping bags as the fog of their collective breath shrouded the bleachers. Remarkably, given the perishing conditions in which the wind-chill peaked at -55C, only one of those present died from exposure in stands surrounding a football field that had literally frozen solid.

Concerned about just such a scenario ahead of the season, Lombardi had spent $80,000 on a crude form of undersoil heating that was ill-equipped to cope with a cold snap that was as extreme as it was unexpected. When the tarpaulins covering the playing surface overnight were removed, moisture that had risen to the surface flash-froze and turned the field into an ice-rink that rendered the cleats worn by the players worse than useless and more of a hindrance than a help. Despite this, there was no suggestion from the sport's overlords that the match should be postponed.

At the risk of labouring the point, it was a day so bitterly cold that the Green Bay wide receiver Carroll Dale's toenails froze, turned black and would later fall off. The Dallas running back Dan Reeves took a hit and walloped his head so hard on the icy turf that one of his own teeth punctured his upper lip leaving a scar that remains to this day. Upon realising his whistle had frozen after an attempt to blow for kick-off, match referee Norm Schachter and his assistants were forced to officiate by shouting and gesticulating to signal the beginning and end of each play. There was no end of pre-match shouting and gesticulating from umpire Joe Connell, who pulled off a sizeable chunk of one of his own lips while trying to separate it from the metal whistle to which it had become firmly frozen. The blood that poured from the wound quickly solidified on Connell's chin and remained visible throughout the game.

"We got extra socks, thermal underwear and things like that," Schachter would later recall. "I had regular underwear on and three pairs of stockings and then I put plastic bags over my feet. I had a sweatshirt from one of the teams, a turtleneck sweater and then we had on those plastic bags you get from the cleaners. I knew my cheeks were frostbitten. If we hadn't had ear muffs and mittens, I think we would have had a tremendous problem."

The players had no such luxuries. Ernie Stautner, coach of the Cowboys' celebrated Doomsday Defence, forbade his charges from wearing gloves on the grounds that they were "for sissies". In a bid to keep his hands warm, the Cowboys wide receiver Bob Hayes, the 1964 Olympic 100m gold medallist, kept them wedged down the front of his pants during huddles. The Packers quickly twigged that unless he removed them it meant he would not be involved in subsequent plays. Many of the players on Lambeau Field that day suffered frostbitten fingers, as well as lung damage sustained by greedily gulping down great mouthfuls of cold air as they went about their brutal business.

After 59 minutes and 44 seconds of shivering, slipping, sliding and no end of slapstick-induced fumbling on this frozen Wisconsin tundra, a thrilling victory eventually went to Lombardi and his Packers. Trailing 17-14 with 16 seconds remaining and just a single yard required to get over the line for a touchdown, the Packers quarterback Bart Starr called a time-out, trotted to the touchline and suggested to Lombardi that due to the inability of the Cowboys defence to hold their footing, he should try a one-yard sneak. In the subsequent play, Packers lineman Jerry Kramer took out Jethro Pugh, his opposite number, leaving a gap for Starr to burrow over the line for the game-winning touchdown.

It was a brave play, but Lombardi was of the opinion that if his players were incapable of making a single yard they didn't deserve to be champions. "Well then run it and let's get the hell out of here," he declared with a laugh, when Starr suggested the audacious quarterback sneak that sealed a third historic title for the Packers. With just 13 seconds left on the clock, for one team at least it was a heartwarming end to the coldest contest in NFL history.Ticket prices are up for this year's glitzy New Year's Eve bash, but concerns remain over the fusion of Trump's public responsibilities and private interests

Trump looks to cash in from lavish NYE party at Mar-a-Lago – but is it ethical?

Donald Trump is throwing a lavish party tonight, as he does every New Year, at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, Florida.

But this year, with the host also serving as US president, he faces questions over the conflation of his business interests and his official responsibilities.

Words fail Trump but for supporters his message is loud and clear Read more

At $600 for dues-paying members and $750 for their guests, ticket prices are up from last year, when, as president-elect, Trump charged $525 for members and $575 for guests.

Last year's party was a capacity sell-out, and included a red carpet arrival, a cocktail hour followed by dinner – last year, 'Mr Trump's wedge salad', wild mushroom & Swiss chard ravioli, sliced tenderloin and pan-seared sea bass, followed by baked Alaska.

Dancing to a covers band until 1am in the Donald J Trump grand ballroom rounded the evening off.

At that event, Trump made a speech to the crowd. He told them: "All I can tell you is, we are going to do a good job."

Richard Painter, the former top ethics lawyer in the George W Bush administration, believes that the party – as with Trump's continued use of the club – offers presidential access to anyone that can afford its $200,000 initiation fee.

"Trump continues to combine his personal business with his official work," says Painter. The real problem, he says, is that Trump is at his so-called 'Winter White House' so often that he is effectively conducting official business while promoting his own property.

"He can easily be contacted by members of Mar-a-Lago, so people who pay him or pay his company money are getting preferential access. If you go to the bar, you run into prominent government officials. So it's lobbying, but it's not lobbying that's going to be disclosed under the Lobbying Disclosure Act."

Over Thanksgiving, club staff placed a red velvet rope around the table where Trump and his immediate family sit for dinner. Officials told CNN the measures were enacted for security reasons but also to restrict access to visitors looking to give advice or seek favors.

The changes may be no more than cosmetic, and Trump is there with people who have paid for membership to a club and the access that goes with it, says Painter.

"It looks like pay-to-play, but the supreme court has interpreted our bribery statutes so narrowly that paying for access to a government official is not considered criminal bribery. So none of this is covered by criminal bribery statutes but it still looks absolutely terrible."

Then there is the issue of Trump Organization branding. The Palm Beach Post has reported that the Trump corporate helicopter has been sitting on the Mar-a-Lago helipad – a helipad that was built, and only supposed to be used for, presidential business.

The chopper is reportedly owned by DT Connect II and DT Connect II Member Corp, a company whose executives include the president's sons, Eric and Donald Jr.

"It is one thing to bring in Marine One with the president on it. It is another thing to bring in helicopters with the president not on it, or private helicopters," Jesse Diner, attorney for Palm Beach resident Nancy deMoss, complained at a February Landmarks Preservation Commission meeting, according to the paper.

The issue of landing rights has been a bone of contention for Palm Beach residents, who have expressed anger that when Trump is in residence at Mar-a-Lago they are restricted from flying their jets into the local airport.

But as Florida's snowbirds prepare the for the Trump bash, some details have begun to leak out.

In the past, decorators have pushed the party decor toward Las Vegas showgirls, the movie Moulin Rouge, and a 70s disco theme. This year, party organizer Steve Levine told the Washington Post that this year's theme would be a less risque "modern fantasy garden", with floral patterns and "metallic gold, silver and shades thereof".

"There's a more modern vibe than in the past," Levine said.

This year's event, the paper also reported, is expected to be bigger than last year's, with a VIP area being built on top of the stage where, presumably Trump, will preside.

The Trump administration has allowed only limited access to the records showing who has visited Mar-a-Lago.

"The problem of the president and his staff only hanging around with extremely rich people who can afford to join Mar-a-Lago is one thing," says Painter, "but we ought to at least be able to see who is coming and going given the amount of official business that's being conducted down there at the club."This article is more than 1 year old

First no hockey, now no music. Ottawa has declared that it's officially too cold – even for Canadians.

Heritage Canada has announced that a New Year's Eve concert planned for Ottawa has been cancelled because of an extreme cold weather warning.

Trump's call for some 'good old global warming' ridiculed by climate experts Read more

The party's cancellation on Friday came after the federal government also moved an outdoor hockey tournament indoors and away from a C$5.6m (£3.3m) temporary ice rink installed on Parliament Hill.



The forecast overnight low for the nation's capital on Sunday is -29C, nearly 20 degrees colder than the seasonal average.

Public skating and a fireworks show on the city's Parliament Hill will go ahead as planned on Sunday night, but Heritage Canada warned revellers have been warned to dress for the weather and "prepare accordingly to prevent frostbite and other injuries".



Most of Canada is in the depths of a deep freeze, with temperatures across the country reaching, and in some cases breaking, cold-weather records. On Thursday Toronto shattered a 57-year record, with the mercury dipping to -22C.



Winnipeg, Manitoba – often referred to by the rest of Canada as "Winterpeg" – has roughly the same Sunday forecast as Ottawa. But according to spokeswoman Chelsea Thomson, outdoor New Year's Eve celebrations will go ahead despite the frosty temperature.

Weather Network meteorologist Doug Gillham and his team predicted this "ferociously cold" start to winter in November by analysing long-term weather models and historic patterns, particularly in the tropical Atlantic.

Thankfully, Gillham's predictions include an expected reprieve when the current cold snap breaks in early-to-mid-January. It's possible temperatures may inch into the teens by mid-February but it's too hard to say for certain exactly how long or how warm the midwinter will be.

"The cold still has a lot of fight in it," Gillham said.

To put it all in perspective, temperatures in some regions have come close to -40C. Photographer Jared Monkman, from Hay river, Northwest Territories, said he would be grateful for a balmy -20C on New Year's Eve.

"In Hay river, we only have outdoor hockey rinks. Minus 20 would be a glorious day outdoors for us," Monkman said. "The town is going to come alive when it hits minus 20," Monkman said, "While Ottawa is shutting down."Deputy prime minister admits programmers gave the $45m device coordinates for Baikonur rather than Vostochny cosmodrome

Russian satellite lost after being set to launch from wrong spaceport

Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin said on Wednesday the loss of a 2.6bn-rouble ($45m) satellite launched last month was due to an embarrassing programming error.

Russian space agency Roscosmos said last month it had lost contact with the newly launched weather satellite – the Meteor-M – after it blasted off from Russia's new Vostochny cosmodrome in the country's far east.

To infinity and beyond: Trump has big plans for Nasa – but is it just a fantasy? Read more

Speaking to Rossiya 24 state TV channel, Rogozin said the failure had been caused by human error. The rocket carrying the satellites had been programmed with the wrong coordinates, he said, saying it had been given bearings for take-off from a different cosmodrome – Baikonur – which Moscow leases from Kazakhstan.

"The rocket was really programmed as if it was taking off from Baikonur," said Rogozin. "They didn't get the coordinates right."

The rocket was carrying 18 smaller satellites belonging to scientific, research and commercial companies from Russia, Norway, Sweden, the US, Japan, Canada and Germany.

The Vostochny spaceport, laid out in the thick taiga forest of the Amur region, is the first civilian rocket launch site in Russia.

In April last year, after delays and massive costs overruns, Russia launched its first rocket from Vostochny, a day after a technical glitch forced an embarrassing postponement of the event in the presence of the president, Vladimir Putin.The disparity in pay between those at the top and bottom of the earnings ladder is revealed by analysis showing the national minimum wage would be £5.24 an hour higher if it had risen at the same rate as a FTSE 100 chief executive's pay over the last two decades.

With 2018 marking the 20th anniversary of legislation that heralded the minimum wage, research by the GMB union underscores by just how much the statutory pay floor has failed to keep pace with executive earnings.

It shows that if increases in the national minimum wage had kept pace with a chief executive it would be £12.74 an hour compared with £7.50 now for those 25 years and older. For a worker aged over 25 on 40 hours per week this would equate to £26,000 a year compared with the £14,664 they are currently paid.

The national minimum wage was a hugely important step for working people in this country and its anniversary should be a cause for celebration of how far we've come

The disclosure will intensify the debate about the yawning gap between the best and worst paid. Analysis published last week by the Vlerick Business School, based on 2016 data, found that chief executives of FTSE 100 companies receive on average 94 times more than the average employee. The average FTSE 100 company chief saw an 11% rise in their median total pay between 2015 and 2016.

Calculations by the High Pay Centre confirm that the average FTSE 100 chief is now paid £4.35m a year – compared with £1.23m when the national minimum wage came in – an increase of 354%.

"The national minimum wage was a hugely important step for working people in this country and its anniversary should be a cause for celebration of how far we've come," said Tim Roache, GMB general secretary. "But this 20th birthday risks being marred by the growing pay gap between workers and company bosses."

Every year the High Pay Centre highlights "fat cat day" when the average FTSE 100 chief executive will have already been paid the same as the average UK worker earns in a whole year. In 2018 the day falls on 4 January.

Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, said: "It's striking that the national minimum wage came in just as executive pay really started to spiral up and out of control. The pay gap has grown ever since, with terrible consequences. There are two ways to close this unacceptable and unjustifiable gap: one is to have more restraint at the top, and the other is to have the long overdue pay rise that lower paid workers deserve. We need rapid progress at both ends of the income scale."ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — The fact that Casey Mittelstadt is dominating at the 2018 World Junior Championship is not a huge surprise. But the fact that he's doing it in Buffalo is a wonderful coincidence and an enormous shot in the arm to one of the NHL's longest-suffering fan bases.

You see, there aren't many markets in the NHL that need something, anything, to cling to more than the one that houses the Buffalo Sabres. And it may just have found that in Mittelstadt, who leads the tournament in scoring and put on a one-man show with three eye-popping assists in Team USA's 4-3 shootout win over Canada in the World Junior Outdoor Cash Grab of HockeyTM Friday. Mittelstadt fell to eighth in what is looking like a pretty strong draft in 2017 and the Sabres got him. Nobody is saying anything, but it would not be a surprise if Mittelstadt turns out to be a one-and-done at the University of Minnesota and signs with the Sabres before next season.

And the fact that he's giving the Sabres and their fans a tantalizing preview of his skills is a neat subplot to the tournament. As one Twitter smart aleck noted Friday, Mittelstadt will soften the blow when Jack Eichel makes his inevitable demand to be shipped out of Buffalo in a couple of years. Mittelstadt, for one, wasn't buying the notion that he was getting a little more juice out of playing in front of the fans he hopes to be entertaining for a long time, and neither was his coach.

"I'm from Minnesota and so is he," said Bob Motzko, who coaches the varsity team at St. Cloud State University when he isn't Team USA's coach for the WJC. "I've seen him do that a lot at a lot of levels. And I think he's going to continue to do that a lot. He's just a talented, talented player."

That is indeed Mittelstadt's calling card. His wizardry with the puck draws comparisons to Clayton Keller, who was a possession machine at the tournament last year. Mittelstadt indeed drives possession the way Keller did and has dynamic puck skills to get it into the right places and to the right people when he sees them in scoring positions. It's clear he sees the game at a much higher level than do most of his peers.

"I've known Casey since the 10th grade and I played with him for two or three years," said Montreal Canadiens first-rounder Ryan Poehling, a fellow Minnesotan and Mittelstadt's teammate on the American squad. "I've said it since Day 1, he's one of the most highly talented kids I've ever seen play the game. For him to come out there on this type of ice, with that much snow, and to do that, it's pretty cool to see. Especially in his hometown of Buffalo."

A little presumptuous, no? Darn right. If the Sabres had their way, they probably wouldn't let Mittelstadt past the city limits after this tournament ends next Friday night and they've got to be hoping that Mittelstadt indeed adopts their city as his hometown for a long time. And after watching the way Mittelstadt and 2018 draft-eligible winger Brady Tkachuk clicked when Motzko juggled his lines in the third period, the Sabres might want to seriously consider taking Tkachuk with what will almost certainly be another top-five pick this June. After all, taking Tkachuks has worked out pretty well in the past. "I played with 'Yamo' (Edmonton Oilers prospect Kailer Yamamoto) a lot in this tournament and we've had some good chemistry," Mittelstadt said. "And (Motzko) put Tkachuk with us and he complements us well. 'Yamo' and I like to move the puck around and make plays with the puck on our sticks and 'Chucky' likes to go to the net."

It's a rather intriguing combination. Mittelstadt is more of a set-up man than a finisher to be sure. "If I've got to shoot it, I've got to shoot it...but I might be a little more pass-first," he said. "I like to see my teammates score and I like to celebrate with them after they score. Every time I can pass, I'll probably pass, but I'm not afraid to shoot it." So having someone who drives the net and can score is pretty much a perfect on-ice companion for him. Last season's Mr. Hockey, a title that goes to the top high school player in the state of Minnesota, certainly has the unique combination of puck poise and vision to make those kinds of plays.

"I take a lot of time in the summer to work on my hands, my vision, things like that," Mittelstadt said. "I think that's probably the biggest key for me, to make sure I'm always fine-tuning it. Even during the year that's the first thing I go to if I feel like I'm not playing well. I go right back to stickhandling and working on my vision and things like that. It's a lot of work."

And it won't get any easier. The Sabres are patiently waiting for Mittelstadt and Eichel to form the deadly 1-2 combination down the middle that will help rise them to the ranks of the NHL's contenders.Loading ... Loading ...

A familiar sight is taking place across Iran tonight and it has been for the last three days. Protests are taking place in numerous cities citing grievances and demanding that the Ayatollah and Iranian President step down. For a few days, the protests remained non-violent but now violence has indeed flared up as protesters have laid waste to a number of government properties and those belonging to "pro-government militias."

Neo-cons in the American media and the U.S. President are all demanding that Americans stand with the "Iranian people" and the "protesters" in their "fight for freedom."

The reason this sight is familiar is because we have seen it in Egypt, Libya, and Syria in the past as well as in Iran itself in the late 2000s. Protests that turn violent, a subsequent crackdown that either is violent or is reported as such, and the weight of American propaganda against the target government are all "Arab Spring" repeats that are themselves nothing more than the color revolution/destabilization apparatus that has been used by the West in countries all across the world for decades, particularly in the last twenty years.

What Do The Protesters Want?

The alleged demands of the protesters seem reasonable and legitimate enough. The Western media has, up until this point, been reporting that the main argument being made by the demonstrators center around economic concerns, i.e. falling living standards, unemployment, and rising food prices. However, as the third day of protests took place, the Western media began reporting that the protesters are demanding an end to religious dictatorship and policies of both the Ayatollah Khamenei and President Rouhani. According to some reports, female protesters have gone so far as to shout "death to Khamenei" and shed their hijabs in order to construct makeshift flags. Others say the protesters are focused on government corruption.

However, there is much question about these protests. The first question is "Are they organic Iranian protests?" This question has yet to be answered fully. Iran is most certainly a religious dictatorship and many Iranians want freedom from religious rule. However, it should be remembered that the United States and Israel have openly stated a desire to see Iranian influence broken and as recently as 2009, the United States attempted to engineer a color revolution in the country. The first three days of the Green Movement in Iran looked very much like the first three days of this current movement.

Clearly, economic concerns are a major issue in Iran, a country whose economy has been suffering for years under Western sanctions and whose own inability to capitalize on a state-owned National Bank. Official unemployment in Iran is around 12% and it is likely that the real rate is much higher. Despite lifting of some sanctions, there is hardly economic growth in the country, another result of neo-liberal economic and trade policies. Yet, it is also worth noting that Khamenei has also been critical of the poor economy and the handling of economic issues by the government yet Khamenei is being insulted at the protests.

These demands are not unreasonable by any stretch of the imagination. However, the religious protests come at a very odd time. Iran recently liberalized its laws regarding women's forced head coverings, so why protest now over religious laws?

In addition, special attention must be paid to the concept of "government corruption," a hallmark of color revolutions since government corruption is often more of a conceptual issue than anything concrete. A step down from power from a few key people, wrist slaps, and token reform can all achieve an "end" to corruption while more concrete demands need concrete applications and thus present a minor loss to those who will taking over the rains of power after the demonstrations have ceased.

There are also more concerning demands that can be found in the slogans being chanted by the demonstrators. First, in case it could be missed, the demonstrators are calling for the Ayatollah and the President to step down. In other words, they are calling for regime change. This is precisely what the United States, GCC, NATO, and Israel also want to see happen.

Second, numerous demonstrators are chanting "Let go of Palestine," and "Not for Gaza, Not for Lebanon, I'd give my life (only) for Iran." Again, protesters are now chanting foreign policy demands identical to that desired by the United States, NATO, GCC, and Israel. All this in a protest that is supposed to be about economic concerns.

Moon of Alabama, in its article entitled "Iran – Regime Change Agents Hijack Economic Protests," reveals a number of important reports regarding the beginning of the protests and where they stand currently. MOA writes,

Protests against the (neo-)liberal economic policies of the Rohani government in Iran are justified. Official unemployment in Iran is above 12% and there is hardly any economic growth. The people in the streets are not the only ones who are dissatisfied with this: Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has repeatedly criticized the government's economic record, said on Wednesday that the nation was struggling with "high prices, inflation and recession", and asked officials to resolve the problems with determination. On Thursday and today the slogans of some protesters turned the call for economic relief into a call for regime change. . . . . . Today, Friday and the weekly day off in Iran, several more protest took place in other cities. A Reuters report from today: About 300 demonstrators gathered in Kermanshah after what Fars called a "call by the anti-revolution" and shouted "Political prisoners should be freed" and "Freedom or death", while destroying some public property. Fars did not name any opposition groups. ... Footage, which could not be verified, showed protests in other cities including Sari and Rasht in the north, Qom south of Tehran, and Hamadan in the west. Mohsen Nasj Hamadani, deputy security chief in Tehran province, said about 50 people had rallied in a Tehran square and most left after being asked by police, but a few who refused were "temporarily detained", the ILNA news agency reported. Some of these protests have genuine economic reasons but get hijacked by other interests: In the central city of Isfahan, a resident said protesters joined a rally held by factory workers demanding back wages. "The slogans quickly changed from the economy to those against (President Hassan) Rouhani and the Supreme Leader (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei)," the resident said by telephone. ... Purely political protests are rare in Iran [...] but demonstrations are often held by workers over layoffs or non-payment of salaries and people who hold deposits in non-regulated, bankrupt financial institutions. ... Alamolhoda, the representative of Ayatollah Khamenei in northeastern Mashhad, said a few people had taken advantage of Thursday's protests against rising prices to chant slogans against Iran's role in regional conflicts. ... "Some people had came to express their demands, but suddenly, in a crowd of hundreds, a small group that did not exceed 50 shouted deviant and horrendous slogans such as 'Let go of Palestine', 'Not Gaza, not Lebanon, I'd give my life (only) for Iran'," Alamolhoda said.

Media and Neo-Con Support

While it is to be expected from a virulently anti-Iran administration and mainstream press in the United States, it is interesting how the U.S. President immediately has latched on the protests, encouraging Americans to stand with the protesters and their demands. This is coming from a man who rarely sees a protest that isn't directed at him. Meanwhile, Neo-Con organs like FOX News are also repeating calls for Americans to support the brave "freedom fighters" in Iran. It is seldom, if ever, true that evil does good in the world so when Neo-Cons call for support to protests, eyebrows should be raised in skepticism.

It is also important to question just how popular these protests are. While mainstream western media and various terrorist organizations also conveniently supporting them paint them as involving tens of thousands at each demonstration, video and pictures tend to show only dozens to hundreds at the most while others wander about around them.

"A video of that protest in Mashad showed some 50 people chanting slogans with more bystander just milling around," writes MOA. . . . . "Two videos posted by BBC Persian and others I have seen show only small active protest groups with a dozen or so people while many more are just standing by or film the people who are chanting slogans."

Trump Administration/Israel Agreement

The protests taking place in Iran are taking place only a month after the White House and Tel Aviv met to discuss a strategy on Iran. "A delegation led by Israel's National Security Adviser met with senior American officials in the White House earlier this month for a joint discussion on strategy to counter Iran's aggression in the Middle East, a senior U.S. official confirmed to Haaretz," wrote Haaretz agency. (Israeli Delegation Met U.S. Officials to Discuss 'Iran Strategy,' Syria)

AXIOS provides a quote from the meeting:

[T]he U.S. and Israel see eye to eye the different developments in the region and especially those that are connected to Iran. We reached at understandings regarding the strategy and the policy needed to counter Iran. Our understandings deal with the overall strategy but also with concrete goals, way of action and the means which need to be used to get obtain those goals.

Could this apparent color revolution be the result of that US/Israeli meeting?

Color Revolution In Iran

The idea that a color revolution could be attempted in Iran is no fantasy. It would be a repeat of history. Remember, in 2009, an attempt at a color revolution deemed the "Green Revolution" was launched but was quickly put down by the iron fist of the Iranian government.

The Path To Persia

The plan for a Western or a Western/Israeli attack on Iran, along with the theatre of alleged US-Israeli tensions leading up to a strike and outright war, has been in the works for some time. For instance, in 2009, the Brookings Institution, a major banking, corporate, and military-industrial firm, released a report entitled "Which Path To Persia? Options For A New American Strategy For Iran," in which the authors mapped out a plan which leaves no doubt as to the ultimate desire from the Western financier, corporate, and governing classes.

The plan involves the description of a number of ways the Western oligarchy would be able to destroy Iran including outright military invasion and occupation. However, the report attempts to outline a number of methods that might possibly be implemented before direct military invasion would be necessary. The plan included attempting to foment destabilization inside Iran via the color revolution apparatus, violent unrest, proxy terrorism, and "limited airstrikes" conducted by the US, Israel or both.

The report states,

Because the Iranian regime is widely disliked by many Iranians, the most obvious and palatable method of bringing about its demise would be to help foster a popular revolution along the lines of the "velvet revolutions" that toppled many communist governments in Eastern Europe beginning in 1989. For many proponents of regime change, it seems self-evident that the United States should encourage the Iranian people to take power in their own name, and that this would be the most legitimate method of regime change. After all, what Iranian or foreigner could object to helping the Iranian people fulfill their own desires? Moreover, Iran's own history would seem to suggest that such an event is plausible. During the 1906 Constitutional Movement, during the late 1930s, arguably during the 1950s, and again during the 1978 Iranian Revolution, coalitions of intellectuals, students, peasants, bazaari merchants, Marxists, constitutionalists, and clerics mobilized against an unpopular regime. In both 1906 and 1978, the revolutionaries secured the support of much of the populace and, in so doing, prevailed. There is evidence that the Islamic regime has antagonized many (perhaps all) of these same factions to the point where they again might be willing to support a change if they feel that it could succeed. This is the foundational belief of those Americans who support regime change, and their hope is that the United States can provide whatever the Iranian people need to believe that another revolution is feasible. Of course, popular revolutions are incredibly complex and rare events. There is little scholarly consensus on what causes a popular revolution, or even the conditions that facilitate them. Even factors often associated with revolutions, such as military defeat, neglect of the military, economic crises, and splits within the elite have all been regular events across the world and throughout history, but only a very few have resulted in a popular revolution. Consequently, all of the literature on how best to promote a popular revolution— in Iran or anywhere else—is highly speculative. Nevertheless, it is the one policy option that holds out the prospect that the United States might eliminate all of the problems it faces from Iran, do so at a bearable cost, and do so in a manner that is acceptable to the Iranian people and most of the rest of the world.

Conclusion

While the situation in Iran continues to develop, it appears that another color revolution is underway. While many of the demands are legitimate, all signs are pointing toward Western treachery in an attempt to break Iran in the final domino to fall in the Middle East before an even bigger confrontation is ignited. Destroying Iran would also destroy Hezbollah, weaken Syria and Russia, and threaten Israel. Whether or not it will succeed will depend on the level of subversion that has been possible by the United States intelligence apparatus since 2009 and the ability of Iran to squash the revolt. If anything can be learned from the 2009 revolution, Iran will move quickly and will smash the protests with an iron fist. However, if the protests taking place in Iran today are indeed a color revolution and if the West is committed, the Path to Persia will likely see an escalation in activity, violence, and ultimately directly military confrontation by proxy and even by the U.S. military itself.

We will following these protests in detail over the coming days.

Help Us Be The Change We Wish To See In The World.TORY MPs are asking the British public to put their hands in their pockets and buy the royal family a new boat.

And, as a treat, some of those who donate money to help Prince Andrew sail to the Seychelles, will be in with a chance of winning a top prize.

That's the proposal being put forward by a group of Tory politicians, including new Dumfries and Galloway MP Alister Jack, to help find the £120 million needed for a Royal Yacht Britannia to "showcase post-Brexit Britain and bring trade to our shores".

The entrepreneur who made his millions hiring out marquees and running self-storage businesses, was one of 50 Tory MPs to have signed a letter to senior Cabinet ministers pleading to "right the wrong" of the Labour government's decision in 1997 to decommission Britannia.

The SNP's Deidre Brock said it was like something from the 19th century.

The Tories want the new yacht to be paid for by public petition, rather than come from government coffers.

One way to help raised funds, they suggest, would be from a new National Lottery game, with profits going to the Britannia.

This, the letter's signatories say, would allow ordinary Britons "the pride of having a stake" in helping to fund the new yacht which would "showcase the best of British business and project our humanitarian role across the globe".

The letter – sent to Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary, Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, and Tracey Crouch, a culture minister – said: "As we leave the European Union, there has never been a better time to consider how Britain projects herself on the world stage.

"We believe that now is the time to commission a new Royal Yacht Britannia as a new symbol of global Britain, designed and built domestically to showcase the best of UK shipbuilding and industry, and as a platform for promoting trade."

Ian Paisley and Sammy Wilson from the DUP, and Lord West of Spithead, a former Labour defence minister, has also signed the letter.

In the letter, they said: "There would be no call upon departmental budgets and it would be the people of the UK through the unique funding method who would have the pride of having a stake in her."

It added: "A new royal yacht will project Britain's unique soft power and influence around the globe.

"She should be at the disposal of both government ministers and the royal family alike to host diplomatic and commercial events on the new vessel, showcasing post-Brexit Britain and bringing trade to our shores."

Though the taxpayer wouldn't have to front the cost, the proposals seems to mean the new royal yacht would belong to the UK state, to give her diplomatic immunity when visiting foreign ports. The paper also reports that she would fly the white ensign, so she is crewed by the Royal Navy.

Johnson and Fox are said to be enthusiastic about the plan.

Brock, who as the Westminster representative for Edinburgh North Leith is the MP for the area where the old Royal Yacht Britannia is situated, was surprised that Tory MPs were still trying to make this happen.

"My first thought was that this was a joke, but if this is a joke it's not terribly funny, is it?

"We've got Tory-imposed austerity biting, food-bank use rocketing and families across the UK facing a tightening squeeze on their household income and the best the Tories can come up with is a wizard wheeze that encourages people to contribute to a £120m yacht.

"This is all part of the Tory's grand plan to drag us back to the 50s – the 1850s, that is. This is a sign of desperation in the Tory ranks over the looming Brexit disaster – to distract us with baubles."

Brock added: "Of course the Royal Yacht Britannia is a fantastic tourist attraction in Leith but the Tory obsession that a new yacht will somehow magically deliver them trade deals is simply bizarre.

"Attempting to distract us with baubles such as a new Britannia is surely a sign of the mounting desperation within Tory ranks over the looming crisis of Brexit."

A spokesman for Camelot, which runs the National Lottery, said any new game would be "a matter for government".Communist Party USA boss John Bachtell boasted in a recent column that his Marxist-Leninist organization, a tentacle of the Soviet regime in America for decades, "utilizes" the increasingly radical Democratic Party to advance its totalitarian objectives in the United States. Writing in the Communist Party propaganda mouthpiece People's World, Bachtell suggested that, eventually, a "radical third party" would become a viable option to advance communism in America. However, for now, he argued, fending off what he calls the "ultra-right" — essentially anyone to the right of Obama, whom American communists openly backed in both elections — requires the CPUSA to continue utilizing the Democrat Party as a "vehicle."

In his column, Bachtell, who was selected last year to serve as the national chair of the Communist Party USA, offers a wide array of arguments for why communists must continue to work through the Democrat Party. For instance, at least in the collectivist communist mind, the Democratic Party is "home" to "African Americans, Latinos, other communities of color, women, most union members, young people," as well as various "social and democratic movements." In reality, of course, there are plenty of blacks, Hispanics, women, and young people who boldly reject statism and the extremist Democrats promoting it.

Still, as many Democrats do, Bachtell lumps unique individuals into "constituencies" based on arbitrary characteristics such as melanin content, and declares that the Democratic Party is their "home." He contrasts that with the GOP and "extreme right-wing elements" such as pro-lifers, climate realists, "right-wing" Christians, the Tea Party, social conservatives, and others, broadly categorized as "ultra-right." By working with and through the Democrat Party, Bachtell purports to be building the "broadest anti-ultra right alliance possible," even openly welcoming a "section" of what he describes as "monopoly" capital on Wall Street into the Communist Party war on liberty.

"This necessarily means working with the Democratic Party," Bachtell explained, adding that some on the Left "underestimate the danger" from the Right and "overestimate" the willingness of "key class and social forces" to leave the Democratic Party right now. "Second, our objective is not to build the Democratic Party. At this stage we are about building the broad people's movement led by labor that utilizes the vehicle of the Democratic Party to advance its agenda. We are about building the movements around the issues roiling wide sections of people that can help shape election contours and debates."

Finally, the Communist Party USA participates in what Bachtell referred to as "coalition campaigns" that challenge the "Wall Street wing" of the Democrat Party and "galvanize forces around a progressive agenda, mainly in Democratic primary elections." Among other examples, he cited "labor activists, progressives, socialists and communists who emerge from movements and run as candidates, backed by broad coalitions." Having self-declared socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont run within the Democrat presidential primary, for instance, "would help do just this," he added. Sen. Sanders has said publicly he would decide by March whether to run for the White House in 2016 as a Democrat.

"If the CPUSA is to be a mass political party it must be a mass electoral party, immersed in every aspect of electoral politics and the process toward political independence," Bachtell continued, explaining to communist lackeys why they must continue to support and infiltrate the Democrat Party to advance more draconian tyranny later on. "Municipal elections are a key arena of battle in 2015.... Clearly, there is an immense amount of electoral activism and movement building that is laying the foundation for the eventual emergence of a mass radical third party." For now, though, the Democrat Party will be "utilized" as the "vehicle" to advance Communist Party totalitarianism — at least until the "Right" is totally crushed.

Commenting on the explosive but hardly surprising admissions, anti-communist analyst Trevor Loudon, author of The Enemies Within exposing subversion at the highest levels of power in the United States, noted that much could be learned from communist strategy. "The Communist Party often upsets less mature Marxist groups because of their refusal to abandon the Democratic Party, despite not always getting every item on their agenda immediately," Loudon explained. "As an experienced Communist, John Bachtell understands that in spite of difficulties and disappointments, the Communist Party agenda is far better served by infiltrating the Democrats than by marching in the streets yelling revolutionary slogans."

As Loudon points out, "the Communist Party and their only marginally less radical Democratic Socialists of America allies can point to real achievements under their 'friend' Barack Obama." From ObamaCare and amnesty for illegal immigrants to the ongoing attacks on the military and restored relations with the mass-murdering communist dictatorship in Havana, numerous CPUSA goals have been advanced through the Democrat Party just in recent years. Of course, the glaring similarities between the positions and policies of the Communist Party USA, the Democrat Party, and the Obama administration have now become fully obvious, at least to anyone who cares to look.

In 2004, for example, the CPUSA platform included, among other elements, demands for "free" healthcare, unrestricted abortion, government-funded education from pre-kindergarten to college, more federal "job" programs for "minorities," more farm subsidies, a higher minimum wage, a ban on "discrimination" against homosexuals, international treaties to stop "global warming," and much more. When compared with the Obama agenda that was unleashed upon America beginning in 2008 and that continues to be foisted on an outraged America today via lawless executive decrees — and funding from the GOP Congress — the parallels are impossible to deny.

In fact, comparing U.S. policy today to the Ten Planks of the Communist Manifesto — government education, progressive income taxes, central bank with monopoly on credit, and much more — key points of the communist agenda have been on the march in the United States for generations. And unsurprisingly, the Communist Party's affinity for advancing its nightmarish vision of total state control via the Democrat Party goes back decades, too, as summarized and extensively documented in KeyWiki. In 1972, for instance, then CPUSA boss Gus Hall outlined the party's policy to do precisely that.

"Our electoral policy has for 25 years been expressed in the phrase, 'the three legs of a stool.'... The stool was constructed at a time when the Party was under sharp attack ... a reflection of the Party's response to the difficulties," he wrote. "The flexibility was contained in the idea that no one leg of the stool was the main leg. Depending on the political pressures, one could choose a particular leg or legs. In fact the concept was built on the idea that when the other two legs, namely, the Communist Party and the forces of political independence, got strong enough, then and only then would the stool sit on three legs. But until that day comes the one operating leg would be the liberal wing of the Democratic Party."

More recently, a 2010 report for the Communist Party's National Convention was prepared by members of the Young Communist League USA. "Currently, the conditions rarely if ever allow us to run open Communists for office," the report stated. "When members do run for office, it is within the auspices of the Democratic Party. Otherwise, we find ourselves supporting progressive (and in some instances not-so-progressive) Democratic candidates. Despite how much many of us would love to run comrades for office as Communists, we all agree that this is how we currently have to function in this political climate."

In late 2012, meanwhile, a report delivered at the 14th International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties in Beirut, Lebanon, praised Obama and the advances he had made for the cause. "The Communist Party USA not only welcomes the reelection of President Barack Obama, but actively engaged in the electoral campaign for his reelection and for the election of many Democratic Party congressional candidates," explained the report, prepared by CPUSA International Department operative Erwin Marquit. "We regarded the 2012 election as the most important in the United States since 1932, an election held in the midst of the Great Depression."

The CPUSA's "present strategy," the report continued, was to "build alliances both inside and outside the Democratic Party." After Obama's re-election in 2012, the so-called "progressive caucus" in Congress — masterfully exposed in Loudon's work — will "be playing an important role in contributing to the mobilization of mass activity on critical issues to bring pressure on the Congress and administration to act on them." The report also openly proclaimed that "the victory of Obama is a welcome aid for us in our domestic struggles." Obama's political career, of course, began in the home of Communist terrorist Bill Ayers, whose Weather Underground terror movement in the United States was backed by Communist mass-murderer Fidel Castro.

In his comments on Bachtell's most recent admission, Loudon said Americans have a lot to learn. In the same manner that the CPUSA has "utilized" the Democrat Party, constitutionalists who hope to preserve liberty and the Republic bequeathed to Americans by the Founding Fathers ought to work within the GOP, Loudon argued. "Bachtell understands that prematurely breaking with the Democrats, on some quixotic adventure of forming a new leftist third party, would almost certainly hand the next few elections to the GOP," Loudon wrote. "He fears that a revitalized GOP, led by Ted Cruz, or some similar figure, would roll back most, or all of the Communist Party's hard fought gains."

"If U.S. Constitutionalist conservatives and Tea Party activists can show similar political discipline and maturity, they will abandon plans for a suicidal third party agenda — for now," Loudon wrote. "Instead they will work through the GOP, as the Communists have through the Democrats. Learn from the opposition. Utilize the GOP machinery and voting base to build a big Constitutionalist base inside the GOP. Build your strength, do as the Communists have done, primary any vulnerable GOP candidates who will not support your Constitutionalist agenda."

Loudon argued that today, less than 1,000 hardcore Communist Party operatives and their few thousand allies in the Democratic Socialists of America "effectively dictate Democratic Party policy." If the far larger constitutionalist and Tea Party movement could learn from the opposition's tactics, "they can have a real shot at restoring the Republic." In the end, Loudon argued, the battle for America is not between Democrats and the GOP. Instead, it is between constitutionalists and communists. If constitutionalists want a chance to win that battle and preserve liberty, he concluded, understanding and learning from the opposition is crucial.

The process of communists using other parties and movements to enslave populations is hardly new — it works the same from Brazil to South Africa and everywhere in between. Communism and communist regimes, of course, murdered well over 100 million people in the last century alone, making the "movement" by far the most murderous and bloodthirsty in the history of humanity. However, as The New American has documented extensively, there have always been even more sinister forces operating behind the communists and their legions of useful idiots. If liberty is to survive, exposing and countering them remains essential.

What was the heinous and violent crime of which the intended target of the raid was charged? Murder? Rape?

Credit card fraud.

This is the incredible, incomprehensible story told by Radley Balko in an op-ed published February 4 in the Washington Post.

Balko includes a video of the incident and the aftermath in his story. If you are concerned about the militarization of American law enforcement, watch this video and pass it around.

Regarding the police department's response, Balko explains:

Finally, note that police department officials say they "do not have a written policy governing how search warrants are executed." That's inexcusable. Most police departments do. But whether or not they're governed by a formal policy, the use of these kinds of tactics for nonviolent crimes like credit card fraud is hardly unusual, and it's happening more often, not less. I've reported on jurisdictions where all felony search warrants are now served with a SWAT team. At least one federal appeals court has now ruled that under the Fourth Amendment, there's nothing unreasonable about using a SWAT team to perform regulatory inspections. To be fair, two others have ruled that such tactics are not reasonable. But it's concerning that this would even be up for debate. We have plenty of discussion and analysis about when searches are appropriate. We also need to start talking about how.

Steadily and speedily, the force of the militarized police is denying citizens the protections of fundamental civil liberties afforded us by the Bill of Rights. While there remain legions of law enforcement officers devoted to protecting and serving their fellow citizens, the federal government's proffer of powerful, free or almost free, weapons, vehicles, gear, and tactical training is making the allure of becoming an unofficial branch of the armed forces irresistible.

To his credit, Balko turns to the experience of our Founding Fathers with armed and aggressive enforcers of "the law" to inform our own understanding of the rising threat of a militarized police. As Public Affairs Books, the publisher of Balko's Rise of the Warrior Cop book, explains:

The American approach to law enforcement was forged by the experience of revolution. Emerging as they did from the shadow of British rule, the country's founders would likely have viewed police, as they exist today, as a standing army, and therefore a threat to liberty. Even so, excessive force and disregard for the Bill of Rights have become epidemic in today's world. According to civil liberties reporter Radley Balko, these are all symptoms of a generation-long shift to increasingly aggressive, militaristic, and arguably unconstitutional policing—one that would have shocked the conscience of America's founders.

During the Virginia ratifying convention, James Madison described a standing army as the "greatest mischief that can happen." His colleague and fellow delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, George Mason put a finer point on it:

No man has a greater regard for the military gentlemen than I have. I admire their intrepidity, perseverance, and valor. But when once a standing army is established in any country, the people lose their liberty. When, against a regular and disciplined army, yeomanry are the only defence [sic], — yeomanry, unskilful and unarmed, — what chance is there for preserving freedom? Give me leave to recur to the page of history, to warn you of your present danger. Recollect the history of most nations of the world. What havoc, desolation, and destruction, have been perpetrated by standing armies!

In The Federalist, No. 29, Alexander Hamilton echoes not only Mason's warning against a standing army, but his solution to the threat, as well.

If circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens. This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.

In commenting on Blackstone's Commentaries, founding era jurist St. George Tucker speaks as if he foresaw our day and the fatal combination of an increasingly militarized police force and the disarmament of civilians:

Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any colour or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.

The connection between this professional, civilian standing army and the attack on the right of the people to keep and bear arms has been recognized by contemporary liberty-minded scholars, as well.

In his essay, "The Right to Keep and Bear Arms under the Second and Fourteenth Amendments: The Framers' Intent and Supreme Court Jurisprudence," Stephen Halbrook writes:

Noah Webster, the influential federalist whose name still appears on dictionaries, stated: "Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed... ." Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States 56 (P. Ford ed. 1888).

In a similar treatise, Joyce Malcolm, a historian specializing in 17th century English constitutional history, makes the same point:

Where does this leave the American Second Amendment, with its reference to a well-regulated militia necessary to the security of a free state, and its insistence that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed? I would argue that the Second Amendment mirrors English belief in the individual's right to be armed, the importance of that right to the preservation of liberty, and the preference for a militia over a standing army.

In an essay published in the Wall Street Journal last August, Radley Balko presented chilling and convincing evidence of the blurring of the line between cop and soldier:

Driven by martial rhetoric and the availability of military-style equipment — from bayonets and M-16 rifles to armored personnel carriers — American police forces have often adopted a mind-set previously reserved for the battlefield. The war on drugs and, more recently, post-9/11 antiterrorism efforts have created a new figure on the U.S. scene: the warrior cop — armed to the teeth, ready to deal harshly with targeted wrongdoers, and a growing threat to familiar American liberties.

Balko rightly connects the menace of the martial police with the decline in liberty and a disintegration of legal boundaries between sheriffs and generals:

Americans have long been wary of using the military for domestic policing. Concerns about potential abuse date back to the creation of the Constitution, when the founders worried about standing armies and the intimidation of the people at large by an overzealous executive, who might choose to follow the unhappy precedents set by Europe's emperors and monarchs.

Given the critical role played by sheriffs in the protection of constitutionally guaranteed liberty, it is dismaying to read story after story describing the eager acceptance — and occasionally the full-time petitioning — of military materiel by county lawmen.

If the threat of the police becoming a standing army of the sort our forefathers believed to be "inconsistent with liberty" is to be diffused, Americans must not only exercise their right to demand that police recognize their responsibility to abide by the law rather than break it, but we must also fiercely resist every attempt to abridge our right to keep and bear arms while keeping ourselves ready to defend that right against all enemies.

Bhagwat had hoisted the national flag at Karnakayamman High School in Palakkad on August 15.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has directed action against the manager and principal of the school in Palakkad, where RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat had hoisted the national flag on Independence Day this year.

The CM reportedly directed the Public Education Department to take action against the school principal and manager for allowing Bhagwat to unfurl the tricolour and thereby violating a circular issued in this regard.

It is also reported that the CM directed the police to examine whether a criminal case will hold on the issue.

Education Minister C Raveendranath told media in Kozhikode on Friday that action will be taken on the basis of the report of the district educational officer (DEO). The minister said that communal interference won't be allowed in educational institutions.

Bhagwat hoisted the national flag at Karnakayamman High School on the morning of August 15.

"Palakkad district collector had given a report soon after the incident which we have brought to the notice of the government. Based on that, we had directed the DEO to seek explanation from the headmaster of the school. The DEO post was vacant in Palakkad after that and only recently it was filled. Again, we have directed to get explanation on it. The action will be based on the DEO's report," Director of Public Instruction KV Mohankumar told TNM.

The Public Education department had issued a circular that the national flag should be hoisted in schools on Independence Day by people's representatives or headmasters.

Palakkad district collector P Marykutty issued a memo to the school, saying that it was not appropriate for a political leader to hoist the national flag at a school. The memo also cited that an elected representative or the principal of the school can do so, but not a political leader.

The RSS, however, had released a statement justifying the chief's action. Dr Manmohan Vaidya, Akhil Bharatiya Prachar Pramukh said in the statement that Bhagwat was invited by the school management to unfurl the national flag. On the collector's notice of restraining Bhagwat from hoisting the flag, the statement said that no other school had been given such directions.

Bhagwat's action however sparked a row in the state. After the incident, Collector Marykutty was transferred in a bureaucratic reshuffle and appointed as Panchayat Director.EAGLEWOOD CLIFFS, NJ—Describing it as a convenient all-in-one option for consumers in a hurry, Hellmann's on Thursday unveiled a new meat-on-the-bottom mayo cup. "With a delicious layer of meat in every cup, you can now enjoy your mayonnaise without having to add your own ground beef or diced ham," said spokesperson Owen Paquete, adding that the cups, which also come in buffalo chicken and smoked brisket flavors, were ideal for a breakfast on the go or a between-meal snack. "Some people immediately stir the mayonnaise and meat together so they can savor all the flavors at once, while others work their way through the mayo first and then treat themselves to a single decadent spoonful of meat and juices—honestly, there's no wrong way to enjoy it." Due to customer demand, Hellmann's had at press time announced plans to expand the line with Greek meat-on-the-bottom mayonnaise cups featuring gyro shavings and souvlaki.

The governing Liberals have promised to create a bill that would remove barriers in federally regulated sectors such as banking, interprovincial transportation, telecommunications and government-run services such as Canada Post.

But what will the expected legislation look like and what will it accomplish? People close to the process weighed in:

— What is Canada's current accessibility picture?

The pending federal legislation would mark the first time Canada has moved to tackle accessibility at the national level. Other countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia have all had federal legislation in place for years or decades. Even most provincial governments have yet to take on the issue. Only Ontario, Manitoba and Nova Scotia have laws in place to address the needs of disabled residents.

— How do accessibility laws work?

They vary widely and have to strike a balance between being specific enough to attain results without being too restrictive for the people and places that have to abide by them. One approach, such as the one used in Ontario, involves developing standards focusing on broad areas such as customer service, built environments or employment. Some experts say Ottawa may go in a similar direction.

Michael Prince, Lansdowne professor of social policy at the University of Victoria, says individuals and businesses need to have enough flexibility to find accessibility solutions that make sense for their environments or clientele.

"We say, 'here's the standard, here's the expected result we want. How you get there is up to you,'" he said of some government approaches.

Prince said some jurisdictions have gone so far as to set up government resources to help organizations comply with accessibility standards. He cited Ireland's Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, an agency established a decade ago to conduct research and help shape accessibility practices in the country and abroad. Prince, who has taken part in numerous government consultations on the Canadian law, said having a comparable resource in place here would go a long way to making sure the new act is effective for years to come.

— What has the government promised?

Kent Hehr, the minister for persons with disabilities and the man charged with crafting the new legislation, says he's on track to table the bill in the spring of 2018 as previously promised. Details, however, are still in the works, and Hehr declined to offer any specifics on what the bill might contain.

Hehr, who is quadriplegic and uses a wheelchair, said Canada is looking to other jurisdictions for lessons on how to implement a sound piece of legislation that would limit the hard work many disabled Canadians do on a regular basis even during some of society's most basic interactions.

"As people with disabilities, we run into situations three, four, five, six times a day," he said in a telephone interview. "And sometimes we become immune to them and we simply find other creative ways to move forward. I'm hoping we don't have to be as creative in the future."

— What kind of barriers do people with disabilities face?

Advocates say every sector that will fall under the scope of a federal act is rife with examples of barriers that vary depending on the disability in question. While many organizations and industries have developed inclusion strategies, they say myriad anecdotes demonstrate the fact that more formal intervention is necessary. Some examples include:

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Banking: When Jim Derksen goes to his local bank to conduct routine transactions, he's never sure that he'll be able to cross those tasks off his to-do list. Derksen, who uses a wheelchair, says many branch counters or bank machine keypads are located too high for someone using a mobility aid to reach. This is exacerbated for those with conditions that limit their ability to extend their arms. Some branches feature a wheelchair-accessible counter, but Derksen said high demand typically results in long lineups.

Even when he makes it to a counter, Derksen said another barrier frequently arises when he tries to use the pin pad. Such machines are regularly secured to the countertop, he said, making it impossible for many customers to reach them.

Derksen recognizes that businesses all over the country often take such precautions as a security measure, but he said the new law must force people to get more proactive in recognizing accessibility barriers and be creative in trying to overcome them.

"We require a law which is enforced, which will push the innovation and the ingenuity," he said. "Because unless there's a push, these compromises will be far less than acceptable."

Transport: In his work for the Council of Canadians with Disabilities, John Rae hears many examples of travel plans thwarted by accessibility barriers. As a blind person, Rae said he cannot use self-check-in kiosks at airports and must rely on harried counter staff for basic travel support.

Up until this year, Via Rail could only accommodate one wheelchair user at a time on its trains. The situation only began to change in the spring after the Canadian Transportation Agency ordered the company to double that capacity across its entire fleet, an edict Via Rail recently announced it would heed after months of resistance.

Rae said an accessibility law is essential to prevent such protracted battles from playing out in future. It would also have the added advantage of ensuring transportation companies keep accessibility in mind when doing everything from purchasing new vehicles to designing customer service protocols.

"(Current laws) talk about 'undue obstacles' to travel. We want the word 'undue' removed," Rae said.

— Would broad "standards" actually help?

Yes, but experts and advocates alike say they won't get the job done on their own. Michael Bach, managing director of the Institute for Research and Development on Inclusion and Society, said a standard in an area such as customer service would push companies to make disability issues a higher priority.

But standards can only go so far, he said, adding a potential benefit of an accessibility law would be its capacity to force the federal government to bring other laws in line. As an example, Bach cited statutes under the banking and tax acts that bar people with intellectual disabilities from either opening their own bank accounts or accessing their own funds.

"It's great to be setting standards and coming up with a process to set them. It's part of the picture, but there's other pieces that need to be addressed for an inclusive and accessible Canada," he said.

Bach and Rae both said the new law should make it mandatory for the government to put its own policies, legislation and program decisions through a disability analysis, just as it currently does for gender-related issues. Rae said such an approach would help identify instances of discriminatory laws on the books and signal that the feds are willing to get their own house in order before compelling others to do the same.

"It would be a signal to the disabled community that the government is really serious about its desire to make Canada a more accessible country."The mayor and city staff are scrambling to explain a miscommunication that left some of the city's most vulnerable seeking warmth in a tiny trailer at Moss Park on Saturday night, believing that there were no spaces available at shelters in the city.

Gillian Kolla, a Toronto Overdose Prevention Society staff member at the park's supervised injection site, raised the alarm on Twitter late Saturday when she said she was told there was no space available on a night that felt like -29 C with the wind chill.

"We are cramming folks into our heated trailer, everyone is freezing," read a tweet on the overdose prevention society's Twitter account. "Where are they to go at 10 p.m. when we close? There are no available shelters, respite or warming centre spaces in the entire city."

Outraged social media users quickly chimed in, with many demanding that the city open every available respite centre. By Sunday, the hashtag "OpenTheArmouries" was trending amid mounting concern for the city's homeless population, which numbers in the thousands.

On Sunday, city staff said there had been available shelter space — including room for almost 40 more people at the Better Living Centre at Exhibition Place.

There was also space at a women's respite centre on Cowan Ave. and the Streets to Homes Assessment and Referral Centre on Peter St., which doesn't have beds but is open for people to keep warm overnight.

Mayor John Tory released a statement on Sunday, saying that he appreciates "the outpouring of emotion from people who want to help Toronto's homeless population," but noted that the Better Living Centre is a preferred option to the armouries and that he supports the shelter staff in deciding "when, and if, extra capacity is required."

"The Better Living Centre can accommodate 110 people right now, it is open 24/7, and it is a city-owned site," Tory said.

Yet Kolla said she was told there was no space available when she called the city's central intake and the Better Living Centre trying to find shelter for the people who had gathered at the Moss Park injection site, which closed at 10 p.m. Saturday.

"We're not there to be a warming centre, but we're the only warm thing in Moss Park," she said.

With no other options available, Kolla said she handed out gift cards so people could keep warm in coffee shops.

Many temporary facilities have been set up to provide relief during the winter months, when shelter occupancy tends to spike. But temporary shelters are not required to meet the same service standards as permanent facilities. Not all of the sites have showers, and most don't offer support services like counselling or case management.

"It's a catastrophe," Cathy Crowe, a street nurse who works to provide services for homeless people, told The Canadian Press. In a phone interview from a temporary shelter in the city's east end — she didn't want to identify it, for fear that describing its conditions might cause the city to shut it down — Crowe described a scene of chaos and neglect.

"It's pretty desperate," she said. "Very crowded. People are in rough shape. Mostly people are sleeping on the floor . . . I'm actually sitting inside and I'm shaking with cold."

With an extreme weather warning still in place Sunday night, the city's poverty reduction advocate, Councillor Joe Mihevc (Ward 21, St. Paul's West) said a city outreach van would be at Moss Park at 7:30 p.m. to take people who need shelter to the Better Living Centre. By early Sunday evening, a small outreach van, which can carry two people at a time, was parked outside the prevention site. Chris Dalton, a worker at the site, said that about 20 people had expressed an interest in taking the van to the Better Living Centre.

There were also free transit tokens and a free taxi service are available to people wanting to access the facility on the CNE grounds, which is more than five kilometres from Yonge-Dundas Square.

It's unclear why people thought there was no space at the shelters.

Mark Aston, the executive director of the Fred Victor Shelter, which is running the respite program at the Better Living Centre, said that "clearly there was some miscommunication," though he's not sure what caused it.

He said they've given the city, which provides most of their referrals, daily updates on usage at the new respite centre.

Aston added that he's spoken with staff and anyone who may potentially answer the phone to clarify the situation and doesn't "anticipate any further miscommunications."

Gord Tanner, the director of Homeless Initiatives and Prevention Services with the City of Toronto, said he checked in with the referral centre and was also told there was space in more than one facility Saturday night.

Sometimes, though, it takes some time to get the word out about new respite centres like the Better Living Centre, Tanner said.

"We've got a lot more winter sites this season than we've had before, so we need to continue to get that message out and let people know where there is space and how to access it."

Despite the space available Saturday night, the shelter system overall was at 95 per cent capacity, above the city's target of 90 per cent capacity, the same as it was on Thursday, when 5,500 people were using the system.

In a city where 80 homeless people have died this year, critics have called it a "shelter crisis."

"We are, as a city, on every spectrum of the shelter situation, failing," said Councillor Joe Cressy (Ward 20, Trinity-Spadina).

The city aims to keep shelters at 90 per cent capacity so that anyone who needs a bed can find one, he explained.

"If we are over 90 per cent, somebody looking for a bed can't find it and that means somebody looking for a bed might be left out in the cold on a very cold night," he said.

He and others have called on the city to open 1,000 new permanent shelter beds next year and to immediately increase emergency shelter capacity by opening the armouries.

Mihevc, the city's poverty reduction advocate, said there are downsides to the armouries. The last time they were used they were available for use as emergency shelter space only between the hours of 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. and it cost the city roughly $800,000 for three weeks.

Mihevc said if the current capacity at the Better Living Centre fills up, he would support expanding the available space at that city-owned facility. Currently, only 10 per cent of the 200,000 square feet available is being used, he said.

While he agreed the city needs more permanent shelter beds and more transitional housing, he said the issue right now is ensuring people know about the available respite space.

At the same time, Don Peat, the mayor's director of communications, said the city is continuing to expand the shelter system.

The mayor and "the majority of council" are relying on the advice of city staff to address concerns about shelter capacity, Peat said in a statement.

"Based on that advice, the city is continuing to expand our shelter system. On top of the additional 400 beds or spaces approved earlier this month, more than 290 shelter beds will be opened in 2018 as part of five new shelter programs serving men, seniors, youth and LGBTQ2S youth," Peat said.

"Council also voted earlier this month to direct city staff to expedite the opening of three additional new shelters next year that were originally planned for 2019, as well as adding three more shelters to the 2019 plan."

With files from Annie Arnone and The Canadian PressMONTREAL—While some politicians and Quebec nationalists fretted in 2017 over the perception Montreal has become too bilingual, new data from the 2016 census reveal the city is truly Canada's trilingual metropolis.

Quebec made international headlines when its legislature voted 111-0 in November in favour of a motion calling on store clerks to greet customers with a "bonjour" instead of the English-French mix, "bonjour/hi."

The reality on the ground in Montreal, however, is that customers to the city's stores and restaurants would likely be just as comfortable with an hola, ciao, namaste, salaam or marhaba.

Census numbers from 2016 reveal Montreal is by far the country's most trilingual city.

The data were specially ordered by Montreal International, a business association, and provided Friday to The Canadian Press.

Statistics Canada's figures indicate more than 21 per cent of Montrealers can speak at least three languages, compared with 11 per cent of Torontonians and 10 per cent of people in Vancouver.

Nearly 850,000 Montrealers know at least three languages and more than 40 per cent of the city's immigrants are trilingual.

Ironically, it's Quebec's language law and immigration policies that encourage trilingualism, said Jack Jedwab, head of the Association for Canadian Studies, who helped obtain the data.

Quebec favours francophone immigrants but many of them also speak English, Jedwab said.

Politicians point to the fact a majority of immigrants to Quebec know some French, but he said they casually leave out the fact almost half also know some English, along with their mother tongues.

"Quebec politicians are well aware that, globally speaking, if we want the best (talent) pool, if we want to attract people with economic skills in a very competitive talent market, they are going to attract a lot of people who are able to speak both English and French," he said.

The data reveal 42 per cent of immigrants who arrived in Montreal between 2011 and 2016 were bilingual and more than one-third of all immigrants were trilingual.

Jedwab said leaders in Quebec use what he called a "double discourse."

"When they want to address the domestic constituency that thinks the use of "hi" is an existential threat to the use of French, they say we need to restrict English words in the commercial sphere," he said.

"But in talking to people outside Quebec, that's not the message they are giving at all," he said, regarding the government's immigration policies and the business community's attempts to attract foreign talent and investment.

She said she isn't surprised Montreal is Canada's most trilingual city.

"I live it and see it on a daily basis," she said. "I think there is a general acceptance of that. I'm used to hearing all kinds of different languages. The diversity is what makes our city what it is."

This not only hurts families, this hurts our children. And it hurts Canada's economy. If the Trudeau government truly wants to help the middle class and women's equality as its party line touts, then it must make higher direct investments in child care.

A new report from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives on the rising cost of child care concludes that the typical family with young children spends about a third of its income on fees. To put this into perspective, this is about $21,096 a year on average in cities like Toronto --- more than triple the average tuition cost to put an older child through university for one year.

The one-third of net income that the typical Canadian family spends on child care is much higher than in other parts of the world. Among 35 wealthy nations, Canada was found by the OECD to be among the most expensive for child care. Only two countries, the United States and Ireland, fare less well than we do.

Helping parents afford this care through a properly funded child-care system might appear to be expensive for society, yet many Canadian studies and reports show that of any policy geared to help struggling families, investments for high-quality child care has the biggest economic payoff for parents and their children.

Investment in child care pays for itself. It has compounding positive effects on women's employment and pay. And it goes even further for low-income families, because it can move generations of children toward increased earnings, better jobs, improved health, more education and decreased criminal activity as adults.

Now imagine if quality child care cost 10 per cent of a family's income at most — not 30 per cent as is currently reported. This would provide more children with a strong start in life and contribute significantly to the economic security of women and families.

The finance minister's recent increase of the Child Care Benefit -- a tax-free monthly payment made to eligible families to help with the cost of raising children — does not directly address the rapidly rising cost of child care and early education programs. And it does nothing for the quality and accessibility of child care at all.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Greater and more meaningful investments in child care are required from our government. According to OECD recommendations, Ottawa should be spending 1 per cent of Canada's GDP on child care. Our government currently invests only 0.25 per cent.

By quadrupling our federal investment, we would both make child care more affordable and improve the quality of programs through supporting the education and training of early childhood educators. It would improve pay and benefits to the child care workforce – those compassionate people who care lovingly, creatively and professionally for children and who are so instrumental in their development.

It is time for our government to invest adequately in child care and for Canada to stop lagging behind among our international community of wealthy nations. It is time to give our children and families quality, affordable, inclusive and accessible child care so we can all make Canada a better country.

On Sunday, "Star Wars: The Last Jedi," which stars Daisy Ridley as the ambitious, lightsaber-wielding Rey, took the top spot on the charts with $517 million. That spot had been held for much of the year by "Beauty and the Beast," which starred Emma Watson as one of Disney's most famous heroines, Belle. Gal Gadot held third place with "Wonder Woman," which became the film of the summer with $412.5 million.

According to data from Box Office Madness and Box Office Mojo, which respectively log box office charts for films released before and after 1980, it has been 59 years since films fronted by women have swept the podium at the box office. In 1958, the top film of the year was "South Pacific," the film adaptation of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical which starred Mitzi Gaynor as a nurse stationed overseas during World War II. In second was the comedy "Auntie Mame," which starred Rosalind Russell as the titular Manhattan socialite who takes her orphaned nephew into her whirlwind life. In third was the adaptation of Tennessee Williams' "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," starring Elizabeth Taylor in the lead role as Maggie "The Cat" Pollitt.

The rise of money-making stars like Ridley and Gadot continues a trend of female-led blockbusters that have popped up this decade starting with Jennifer Lawrence in the "Hunger Games" films. That trend is expected to continue in 2018, when one of the first wide releases of the year will be Taraji P. Henson's action-thriller Proud Mary," in which she plays an assassin. That will continue later in the year with actresses like Natalie Portman in "Annihilation," Alicia Vikander in "Tomb Raider," Rosa Salazar in "Alita: Battle Angel," and Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling in Ava DuVernay's "A Wrinkle in Time."We've made it through 2017.

His offspring, Russia-related investigations aside, didn't do too shabbily either. White House policy adviser Ivanka Trump's brand opened a splashy new store in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan, just in time for Christmas.

If you look at the stock and asset markets, as Donald Trump tends to do (and as Barack Obama did, too), you'd think all is fine with the world. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 24 percent this year. The Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index rose 6.20 percent. The price of one Bitcoin rose about 1,646 percent.

On the flip side of that euphoria however, is the fact that the median wage rose just 2.4 percent and has remained effectively stagnant relative to inflation. And although the unemployment rate fell to a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, the labor force participation rate dropped to 62.7 percent, its lowest level in nearly four decades—particularly difficult for new entrants to the workforce, such as students graduating under a $1.3 trillion pile of unrepayable or very challenging student loan debt. (Not to worry though: Goldman Sachs is on that, promoting a way to profit from this debt by stuffing it into other assets and selling those off to investors, a la shades of the subprime mortgage crisis.)

Those of us living in the actual world without billionaire family pedigrees possess a healthy dose of skepticism over the "Make America Great Again" sect that believes Trump has transformed America "hugely," for record-setting markets don't imply economic stability, nor do 40 percent corporate tax cuts translate into 40 percent wage growth. We can march forward into 2018 carrying that knowledge with us.

But first, a recap. For the U.S. financial system, 2017 was marked by five main themes: The GOP's "You All Just Got a Lot Richer" Corporate Tax Reduction Plan; Big Banks Still Bad; The Fed's Minor Policy Shift; Debt; and Deregulators Appointed to Positions of Regulatory Authority.

Banks Are Still Big and Bad

The Big Six banks have paid billions of dollars in settlements for a variety of frauds committed before and since the 2007-2008 financial crisis, but that didn't keep them from tallying up new fines in 2017. The nation's largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, agreed to pay $53 million in fines for scamming African-American and Latino mortgage borrowers with disproportionately higher rates than for white borrowers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined Citigroup $28.8 million for not disclosing foreclosure-avoiding actions. Bank of America got fined $45 million for its foul treatment of a California couple trying to save their home.

But the Big Six bank that received the most attention in 2017, as it did in 2016, was Wells Fargo. The number of people affected by its fake-account creation scandal grew from 2 million reported in 2016 to about 3.5 million. That increase resulted in Wells Fargo expanding its associated class-action settlement to $142 million.

Wells Fargo was mired in smaller scandals, too. For instance, it charged 800,000 customers for auto insurance they didn't need, raised mortgage rates for certain customers without properly disclosing it was going to, and made a bunch of unauthorized adjustments to people's mortgages.

No Glass-Steagall Reinstatement, More Deregulation

The idea of reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 featured in both the Democratic and the Republican National Committees' platforms during the campaign season. But Trump's treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, made it clear multiple times there would be no such push from the administration, arguing against doing so before senators including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

To emphasize his disdain for regulation and oversight, Mnuchin also pushed the Financial Stability Oversight Council, over which he presides, to vote 6 to 3 to rescind American International Group's designation as posing a potential threat to the U.S. financial system. Thus, AIG will no longer be paying penance for its role at the epicenter of the last financial crisis by filing regular risk reports anymore. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen also supported the move.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Bashing

In a major blow to citizen security, Richard Cordray, the Obama-appointed regulator, resigned as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in November.

During his six years at the helm of the CFPB, which the Dodd-Frank Act formed in 2011, the 1,600-person regulatory entity accomplished a lot. It has provided $11.9 billion in relief to consumers for enforcement actions affecting more than 29.1 million people, handled 1.2 million consumer complaints and garnered timely responses on concerns for 97 percent of consumers.

Still, Trump appointed White House budget director Mick Mulvaney to the post that Cordray vacated. Remember: Mulvaney as a congressman wasn't a fan of protecting consumers. "I don't like the fact that [the] CFPB exists," he said. "I will be perfectly honest with you."

Over at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Joseph Otting, Mnuchin's former partner in the takeover of IndyMac and subsequent flurry of foreclosures, was confirmed to the top position. In that spot, Otting will be able to help the Trump administration dial back more post-crisis bank regulations.

The Fed and Debt Bubbles

The Federal Reserve raised rates three times this year. With trepidation that more or larger hikes would cause a market meltdown (because cheap money has lifted banks and markets over the past decade), each time the Fed acted, it did so by the smallest sliver it could—25 basis points. All told, this brings the total rate hikes of 2017 to 75 basis points. The short-term interest rate now sits in a 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent range.

As part of its rate-hike-into-strength message, the Fed forecast that the job market and economy will further improve in 2018. Trump's appointed Fed leader, Janet Yellen's No. 2 man, Jerome Powell, will take stewardship of the Fed in February 2018. Policywise, he will do exactly what Yellen and Ben Bernanke did before him, given that's how all his votes went—albeit while advocating less oversight of the big banks. That's because cheap money turbo-boosts the stock market, and quick rate hikes can harm the bond markets.

The reality is that the Fed and the administration are scared that selling too many bonds back into the capital markets will result in broader sell-offs, which could lead to another credit squeeze and possible recession, not to mention losses for the big banks exposed to those corporations.

Zombie Companies

Fueled by cheap Fed money and low rates, the amount of outstanding corporate debt has nearly doubled from pre-crisis levels of $3.4 trillion to record levels of $6.4 trillion.

By Oct. 1, U.S. investment-grade corporate debt issuance had already surpassed $1 trillion—beating 2016's pace by three weeks. The amount of speculative-grade (or junkier) corporate debt issued during the first three quarters of 2017 was 17 percent higher than over the same period in 2016. Altogether, that means that U.S. corporate issuance is set for another record year, as well as the sixth consecutive year of increased corporate debt issuance.

As history has shown us, all bubbles pop. Until then, certain companies are the equivalent of the living dead. The Bank of International Settlements (BIS), or central bank of global central banks, defines zombie firms as "firms that could not survive without a flow of cheap financing." The latest BIS Quarterly Report labeled one of every 10 corporations in emerging (EME) and advanced countries as a "zombie."

Corporate debt of nonfinancial U.S. companies as a percentage of GDP has surged before each of the last three recessions. This year, it reached 2007 pre-crisis levels. That didn't end well last time. Plus, now, that debt has been powered by central banks the world over.

And whereas, in the past, companies used some of their debt to invest in real growth, this time corporate investment has remained relatively low. Instead, companies have been on a spree of buying their own stock, establishing a return to 2007-level stock buybacks.

Corporations and Taxes

Companies have taken advantage of cheap money to increase their debt and buy their own stock, even though Trump and the GOP peddled the notion that decreasing their tax rate by a whopping 40 percent would move them toward diverting their money from the stock and bond markets into jobs and wages.

The GOP tax bill cuts the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Collectively, large U.S. companies only pay an average effective tax rate of 18 percent anyway. They only contribute 9 percent to the overall tax receipts the U.S. government receives each year.

Companies like General Electric haven't paid any taxes in a decade. But more to the point, that tax cut is another form of cheap money giveaway. Even Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, concurred. He called the tax cut a "QE4" (another round of quantitative easing, added to the three rounds the Fed executed over the past decade to reach $4.41 trillion in credit).

Looking Ahead to 2018

As we enter the new year, consider this: All the Fed talk about "tapering" or reducing the size of its book, and even the 75 basis points of rate hikes, are a setup for the next act of the same play.

Since the Fed's announcement that it was going to stop reinvesting the interest payments on the bonds it's holding, the size of its book has been about the same. There's always a mismatch between what the Fed says and what it does.

So despite its tapering talk, the Fed's balance sheet is down a mere $10 billion (an equivalent of a rounding error) this year. Its book of assets remains at $4.41 trillion, a figure equivalent to 23 percent of U.S. GDP. Incoming Fed Chair Powell is more likely to keep supplying cheap money than withdrawing it from the markets in the instance of any wobbles.

What does that mean? Financially speaking, 2018 will be a precarious year of more bubbles inflated by cheap money, followed by a leakage that will begin with the bond or debt markets. The GOP tax cuts won't technically kick in monetarily for corporations until after the year is over in 2019, but the anticipation of extra funds will fuel more buybacks. This will help to provide cover for any rate hikes the Fed implements, because it provides corporations the ability to boost their own share prices further.

Meanwhile, the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and other smaller regulatory authorities in Washington will push for greater deregulation of the financial systems and banking industry on any level possible. If there is another financial crisis in 2018 or later, it will be worse than the last one because the system remains fundamentally unreformed, banks remain too big to fail and the Fed and other central banks continue to control the flow of funds to these banks (and through to the markets) by maintaining a cheap cost of funds.

Politically, no one in any position of power will do anything to fix any of this.Chevron announced more layoffs are coming to the San Joaquin Valley Business Unit on Monday.

On Dec. 11, Chevron said 122 employees received notice that their positions will be eliminated next year. This comes after the company's San Joaquin Valley Business Unit (SJVBU) announced a cut to 26% of employees based in that unit as part of a new organizational model.

RELATED: Chevron announces more cuts in Kern County

Chevron said around 300 layoffs will occur in phases between now and the end of next year. The first layoff notifications went to 100 employees on Nov. 30.

All SJVBU field and office locations are affected, including the field and office locations in Kern, Fresno and Monterey Counties. Chevron said about 80% of those laid off will be eligible for positions at other Chevron locations in 2018. Some employees may receive severance pay, educational assistance and career transitional services, Chevron said.

The full statement from Chevron:

In October 2017, Chevron's San Joaquin Valley Business Unit (SJVBU) announced a new organizational model that will result in a 26% reduction in employees who are based in SJVBU. The reduction applies across all SJVBU field and office locations, including the filed and office locations in Kern County, Fresno County and Monterey County. The position reductions will occur in a phased approach between now and the end of 2018. The first termination notifications as part of this reorganization were provided to over 100 employees on November 30, 2017 with the elimination of those positions scheduled for January 2018. Today, an additional 122 employees received notification that their positions will be eliminated, with approximately 80% of those individuals remaining eligible to pursue positions at other Chevron locations in 2018. The departure of these employees from SJVBU will be staggered throughout 2018. Eligible employees may receive severance pay, educational assistance, and career transitional services.

It is estimated that approximately 300 employee positions across the three counties in which SJVBU operates will be eliminated over the course of 2018 as part of this reorganization. However, eligible SJVBU employees will have the opportunity to pursue positions at other Chevron locations in 2018. Recently, Chevron has successfully placed approximately 100 employees in positions at other Chevron locations.

The Trump administration's newly unveiled national security strategy lists reinforcing America's alliances as a major objective. Yet in the first year of his embattled presidency, Donald Trump has so undermined our ties to Europe that we could be on the verge of a break in the seven-decade trans-Atlantic alliance.

Trump is the first U.S. president since World War II who does not seem to consider himself the leader of the democratic West. His populist America First platform has opened deep fissures in his relations with European leaders.

More:Ambassador: Base China-U.S. relations on cooperation, not confrontation

He has changed the way the U.S. government talks about our oldest allies, describing the European Union more as an economic competitor than a leading strategic partner. In contrast, prior U.S. presidents regarded the European project as a force multiplier for shared interests across the Atlantic in democracy, human rights and the rule of law.

Trump's distancing from Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel and, more recently, British Prime Minister Theresa May, however, is strikingly different than his praise of autocratic leaders Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia. Trump often seems more interested in forging closer links with Putin than with Merkel. This poses an immediate problem for Washington at a time when it needs a stronger channel to Berlin, to compensate for reduced British influence in Europe due to Brexit.

Trump also seems more often at war with NATO than leading it. While he is right to criticize the allies for insufficient defense spending, he must be careful to avoid demonizing Europe to the American public. After all, Europe fought to end the Bosnia and Kosovo wars with us, stood by us on 9/11, and still has troops with us in Afghanistan.

Recent U.S. presidents conceived ambitious and historic projects with Europe. George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton guided NATO toward peace with a new Russia at the end of the Cold War. George W. Bush persuaded NATO to adopt a counterterrorism focus after 9/11. Trump has failed to undertake anything close to this in strategic importance. And as NATO allies Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic embrace far right populism, Trump has failed to do what John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan did so effectively at critical moments of the Cold War — stand up for the democratic values at the heart of our ties to Europe.

Trump's refusal to admit any refugees into the USA for four months and his continuing refusal to admit any refugees from Syria have left the EU shouldering nearly all the burden during the most serious refugee crisis since 1945. His disavowal of free tradeand the Paris climate accord, withdrawal from two United Nations agencies and distancing from the Iran nuclear deal and NAFTA have rattled European leaders,whose differences with Trump's agenda now clearly outweigh areas of agreement.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

It is thus not surprising that in a new poll by the German firm Körber-Stiftung, 88% of Germans say their country's priority defense partner should be the EU and not the United States.

A Pew poll this summer illuminated a similar decline in European confidence in Washington since Trump assumed the presidency, with 62% of Germans holding an unfavorable view of America.

This translates into a deep loss of American influence with a continent that remains Washington's largest trade partner, largest investor in its economy and largest collection of allies worldwide.

U.S. Foreign Service officers of my generation considered ourselves guardians of an alliance with Europe that was vital for our economy, security and values. All our presidents were wired for leadership with their European counterparts. We saw the alliance with Europe as one of the great American achievements of the past century.

Yet Trump displays little interest in writing the next chapter of the West. Instead, we are left with clashing substance and symbols even in the once special relationship between Britain and America. How else to understand the unprecedented repudiation of a U.S. president by the archbishop of Canterbury and the British prime minister after Trump foolishly retweeted a vile British anti-Muslim website.

Europe still matters to America. We are together the central organizer of the most important global institutions. We remain the most powerful political, military and economic force for good. Polls on this side of the Atlantic continue to show that a majority of Americans support NATO, strong ties to Europe and free trade, even as our president heads resolutely in the opposite direction.

We'll need to remember where to find that strength and leadership when we rebuild America's strategic position in Europe, and its global reputation, after the Trump era comes mercifully to an end.

WASHINGTON – When Celeste Kidd was a graduate student of neuroscience at the University of Rochester she says a professor supervising her made her life unbearable by stalking her, making demeaning comments about her weight and talking about sex.

Ten years on and now a professor of neuroscience at the university, Kidd is taking legal action. She has filed a federal lawsuit against the school alleging that it mishandled its sexual harassment investigation into the professor's actions and then retaliated against her and her colleagues for reporting the misconduct.

"We are trying to bring transparency to a system that is corrupt," Kidd told The Associated Press.

Academia — like Hollywood, the media and Congress — is facing its own #MeToo movement over allegations of sexual misconduct. Brett Sokolow, who heads an association of sexual harassment investigators on campuses, estimates that the number of reported complaints has risen by about 10 percent since the accusations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein surfaced in early October, spurring more women to speak out against harassment in various fields. The increase is mostly from women complaining of harassment by faculty members who are their superiors.

But the Trump administration has viewed the issue of sexual harassment on campus in a different light. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has scrapped Obama-era regulations on investigating sexual assault, arguing that they were skewed in favor of the accuser. New instructions allow universities to require higher standards of evidence when handling such complaints.

A forthcoming study of nearly 300 such cases in the Utah Law Review found that one in 10 female graduate students at major research universities reports being sexually harassed by a faculty member. And in more than half of those cases, the alleged perpetrator is a repeat offender, according to the study.

"Often schools might turn a blind eye toward sexual harassment that they know about or have heard about because a professor is bringing in a big grant or is adding to the stature of the university," said Neena Chaudhry, senior counsel at the National Women's Law Center.

The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment.

Activists say young women pursuing graduate studies are especially vulnerable to sexual misconduct because they depend heavily on their academic adviser to complete their degrees, pursue research in their field of study and get recommendations for future jobs. Reporting misconduct could endanger an academic career. And besides damaging the women's mental health and well-being, sexual harassment can chase some of them out of academia altogether.

"Often professors who are advising graduate students are the students' gateway to their degree attainment and their career prospects," said Anne Hedgepeth with the American Association of University Women. "That's an immense amount of power that professors hold. It's also an immense amount of risk that students take when coming forward when future prospects are on the line."

That sums up what happened to Kidd, according to the lawsuit.

Kidd says Florian Jaeger, a distinguished linguistics professor at the New York university's cognitive sciences department who was one of her academic advisers in 2007, pressured her to rent a room in his apartment for a year. She says he then constantly intruded in her private life, demoralized her and talked to her about oral sex and other sexually explicit topics.

"I begged him to stop and to just advise me professionally and he said that was impossible, that wasn't his mentorship style," Kidd said in a phone interview. "There were many moments where I went to sleep in the lab and I wondered what I had done to deserve the hell I was living in every day."

When Kidd protested, Jaeger made it understood that he could derail her career.

"He had a lot of control over my work life, he had the ears of everybody in the field," she recalled. "He reminded me constantly that they know him, that he was a big shot and that I was no one."

In the end, Kidd moved out of Jaeger's apartment and abandoned language research so that she wouldn't have to be supervised by Jaeger. She now studies attention and general learning.

Last year, two professors at the department, in whom Kidd eventually confided, filed a sexual harassment complaint. The university investigated but found the allegations unsubstantiated. The professors say the university then began a retaliation campaign against them. In August, Kidd together with a group of faculty members filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency in charge of workplace discrimination issues. In December, Kidd and her colleagues filed a federal lawsuit.

The university responded by placing Jaeger, now a tenured professor, on administrative leave and commissioning an independent investigation. Results are expected in early January.

University President Joel Seligman said in a statement that the school is committed to creating a safe and respectful environment, but vowed to "vigorously defend" himself and the university provost against some personal claims made against them in the suit.

Jaeger did not respond to an email seeking comment. But shortly after the case was made public this fall, he emailed his students to say that while some of the online comments about him were painful to read, "I am glad that there is now generally so much support for people who speak up against discrimination." Jaeger added that he has always tried to make his lab "an exciting, sa(f)e and supportive place to pursue science" and that he has received letters of support from former students.

As universities face pressure to rethink their sexual misconduct policies, activists suggest various possible remedies: spelling out what interaction is appropriate between faculty and students; more transparency in reporting and investigating complaints; more women in senior leadership positions in academia; and making a student's career less dependent on just one professor.

"There is really no excuse for not addressing this," said Chaudhry of the National Women's Law Center.Share 0 Tweet 0 reddit 8 Email

We are witnessing an escalating chorus of complaints that modern universities are trampling on the First Amendment. Universities stand accused of catering to the weakness of students with "fragile egos," in Attorney General Jeff Sessions's words, who cannot bear to be offended by ideas that they oppose.

"Freedom of thought and speech on the American campus are under attack," Sessions said at Georgetown in September, in a speech that referred to several incidents that have become touchstones for free speech advocates — including the the controversy that erupted at Berkeley when right-wing columnist Ben Shapiro spoke, and the shouting down of The Bell Curve author Charles Murray at Middlebury College last spring. Especially deplorable was the fact one of Murray's hosts, a professor, was injured in a post-speech scuffle.

Seen in its best light, the controversy about free speech in American universities bespeaks fear that the next generation of Americans will not have been educated to engage in public debate, which necessarily entails encounter with alien and frequently outrageous perspectives. That is a problem well worth addressing, especially as our politics grows more diverse and more polarized. Universities do have a great responsibility to educate students for citizenship in a country violently split along lines of ideology and identity.

The language and structure of First Amendment rights, however, is a misguided way to conceptualize the complex and subtle processes that make such education possible. First Amendment rights were developed and defined in order to protect the political life of the nation. But life within universities is not a mirror of that life.

Read Erwin Chemerinsky's argument that campus speakers enjoy robust free speech rights here.

The Supreme Court has often observed that the First Amendment is the "guardian of our democracy." By guaranteeing that all can participate in the formation "of that public opinion which is the final source of government in a democratic state," the First Amendment lies at the foundation of our self-governance.

The noted legal scholar Alexander Meiklejohn once said that the First Amendment created an "equality of status in the field of ideas." It prevents the state from excluding persons from public discourse on the basis of what they have to say. It extends to each citizen the promise that they will enjoy the equal right to influence the development of public opinion.

There are many arenas in which all ideas are not considered equal

But here we are talking about public discourse: the free flow of ideas in newspapers, in public squares, on debate stages, on theatrical stages, in art galleries and concert halls. Outside of the sphere of public discourse, equality is not so obviously desirable. Consider, for example, doctors and their patients. The law properly does not treat doctors and their patients as equals. We do not apply to doctors sued for malpractice the core First Amendment doctrine that "there is no such thing as false idea." We hold doctors accountable for their expertise.

There are in fact many areas of our social life where we expect persons to act with competence, and where the law properly defers to accepted bodies of knowledge. We abuse the First Amendment by misapplying it to such areas. We risk diluting its essential meaning and force. That is the error made by Sessions and many others.

Universities exist to serve the twin missions of education and the creation of knowledge. Universities hire and tenure faculty based on the quality of their ideas. Universities grade and evaluate students based on the quality of their ideas. The purpose of universities is to teach students how to discriminate between better and worse ideas, as well as to determine what we know on the basis of our best possible ideas.

No university, public or private, could perform its mission were it not permitted to evaluate the merit of ideas. Consider Sessions's observation that a "first axiom of the First Amendment" is that, "as a general rule, the state has no power to ban speech on the basis of its content." That is indeed true. But universities can and must engage in content discrimination all the time. I subject my students to constant content discrimination. If I am teaching a course on constitutional law, my students had better discuss constitutional law and not the World Series.

Professors are also subject to continual content discrimination in their teaching and their research. If I am hired to teach mathematics, I had better spend my class time talking about my equations and not the behavior of President Donald Trump. If I am being considered for tenure or for a grant, my research will be evaluated for its quality and its potential impact on my discipline. Universities, public or private, could not function if they could not make judgments based on content.

Another "bedrock principle" of the First Amendment is that "the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable." Yet no competent teacher would permit a class to descend into name-calling and insults. Even if the object of classroom education is to expose students to ideas that they might find disturbing or threatening, it is nevertheless inconsistent with learning for students to experience this encounter in settings where they are personally abused or degraded.

Just as offensive personal insults are forbidden on the floor of Congress — remember Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was censured by the Senate during Sessions's confirmation hearings for daring to read a letter by Coretta Scott King that "impugned the motives and conduct" of Sessions — so responsible teachers control classroom discussion in order to maintain civility.

Classrooms are not Hyde Parks

If students cannot engage in personal abuse, neither can professors. Any professor that called his students offensive or derogatory names would be appropriately disciplined. The professional ethics of professors require us to "demonstrate respect for students as individuals and adhere to their proper roles as intellectual guides and counselors."

This is not to say that members of the university community do not enjoy special freedoms. They have the right to academic freedom, not First Amendment freedom of speech. Academic freedom is defined in terms of the twin missions of the university; it encompasses freedom of research and freedom of teaching. Academic freedom does not entail the equality of ideas. To the contrary, it is defined as the freedom to engage in professionally competent teaching and research.

By contrast, because First Amendment rights protect the right of each and every person to participate in the magnificent process of self-governance, it forbids the state from evaluating the competence of opinions. Citizens are not students under the tutelage of the state; the state is rather the servant of the people. Students are, however, under the tutelage of the university, which is an arena of education, not of political self-governance.

The situation becomes somewhat more complex when speakers from outside the university, with only tenuous connections to the community, are invited to talk. Sometime such invitations raise questions of academic freedom.

Consider a faculty member who invites an outside speaker to lecture because she believes that the speaker will contribute to her research or to her pedagogical responsibilities. If the university administration believes that the outside speaker is inconsistent with the research or educational functions of the university, there is a conflict between faculty and administration about how to attain university goals.

Principles of academic freedom require the university administration to give great (if not decisive) deference to the judgment of faculty in such contexts. First Amendment free speech principles have little to do with the matter.

The key question: what role do visiting speakers play in the mission of a university?

The situation grows yet more complex in the context of student-invited outside speakers. Students are not accountable for the research mission of the university or for its educational responsibilities. It is a genuine challenge, therefore, how to analyze student-invited speakers in terms of the goals of the university. Still, it remains clear that universities are not Hyde Parks. Unless they are wasting their resources on frolics and detours, they can support student-invited speakers only because it serves university purposes to do so. And these purposes must involve the purpose of education.

Universities typically don't think hard enough about how authorizing students to invite speakers advances their education. One theory might be that universities support student-invited speakers because they wish to empower students to pursue research interests different from those offered by faculty. Another theory might be that universities support student-invited speakers because they wish to create a diverse and heterogeneous campus climate in which students can learn the democratic skills necessary to negotiate a public sphere filled with alien and cacophonous voices. Universities may wish to educate students in practices of citizenship by encouraging a wide variety of student groups to invite outside speakers to recreate within the campus a marketplace of ideas.

As universities clarify why they support student-invited outside speakers, they will at the same time clarify the circumstances in which the communication of such speakers can be regulated. I very much doubt that the First Amendment rights of invited speakers will be of much weight in this process. Instead judgment will turn on how supporting or not supporting a given speaker, or a given policy of supporting student groups to invite speakers, fulfills the articulated mission of the university.

(I am not now analyzing situations where students invite speakers using entirely no university resources — no student fees, no security costs, no campus auditoriums — because in such cases universities will have nothing to do with speakers or their speech. I am instead focusing on the more common circumstance where universities allocate their resources to supporting student-invited speakers.)

Universities might decide it's okay to invite controversial speakers but still impose rules

To the extent that the educational mission of higher education includes the inculcation of critical thinking, it requires universities to instill in students the capacity to face and evaluate ideas, however threatening or dangerous they may seem. Universities must thus distinguish between offensive ideas and personal incivility. Although the First Amendment makes no such distinction, it is important for any university that seeks to encourage both rational dialogue and the mastery of ideas, however strange and off-putting.

These are essential skills for democratic citizens, yet to teach them, universities must be free to regulate speech in ways that are inconsistent with First Amendment rights, at least as ordinarily interpreted. If a campus speaker hurls personal insults at students — if he outs them or individually intimidates them — he has no business on campus.

Universities can and must engage in content discrimination all the time. If I am teaching a course on constitutional law, my students had better discuss constitutional law and not the World Series.

In Dean Erwin Chemerinsky's fine post (also published on Vox), he takes issue with the analysis I have offered and makes two major points. The first is that it is fallacious for me to presume that because the university can regulate the content of faculty and student work, it can do so "outside of this realm." The regulation of speech within "professional settings" does "not justify" restricting campus speech "in a nonprofessional setting."

I believe that this point by Dean Chemerinsky is fundamentally mistaken. The entire purpose of a university is to educate and to expand knowledge, and so everything a university does must be justified by reference to these twin purposes. These objectives govern all university action, inside and outside the classroom; they are as applicable to nonprofessional speech as they are to student and faculty work.

To give a simple example, students are free to march with candles chanting, "No means yes, yes means anal," in a park. The First Amendment gives them the right to do so. But no sane university would tolerate a student group marching through its campus shouting this ugly slogan (as some male students once did at Yale). The university would be entitled to institute disciplinary proceedings because the relationship — the entire relationship — between a university and its students is governed by the goal of education. Students are members of a university community dedicated to learning, and the university is entitled to enforce the obligations of community membership.

The limits on the university's ability to regulate the speech of its students are therefore demarcated by the limits of its educational reach over students. Such limits do in fact exist. During the days of the free speech movement in the 1960s, for example, many demanded that Berkeley punish students who had participated in the (illegal) sit-ins in the South. Berkeley Chancellor Clark Kerr correctly resisted these demands on the grounds that the educational responsibilities of the university did not reach the students' off-campus political activities.

Chemerinsky's second point is that we must separate the "actual" law from what I think the law should be. Fair enough. But any lawyer knows that courts say all kinds of absurd things that they cannot possibly mean. Courts cannot mean what Chemerinsky says they mean, if courts actually say that a speaker cannot be excluded from campus because of his or her viewpoint.

In fact, speakers are almost always invited to campus because of their viewpoint, because someone thinks they have something worthwhile to say. Graduation speakers are selected because deans believe their ideas are serious and should be heard. Given that all speakers are selected on the basis of their viewpoints, innumerable speakers are also excluded because of their viewpoints. Another way of saying this is that the cardinal First Amendment rule of viewpoint neutrality has absolutely no relevance to the selection of university speakers. Any court that denies this is living in fantasy, blinded by a mechanical doctrine that has no relevance to the phenomena it is supposed to control.

It is of course more complicated when a university has delegated the power to make such viewpoint-based judgments to student groups, and then wishes to countermand the decisions of those groups. In such instances, we have a question of how authority ought to be distributed within a university. This question is not usefully analyzed as a First Amendment question, because the rights of speakers are not determinative.

Underlying Chemerinsky's post is the assumption that speech within the university (and outside the classroom) is the same as in the public sphere. But the root and fiber of the university is not equivalent to the public sphere. If a university believes that its educational mission requires it to prohibit all outside speakers, or to impose stringent tests of professional competence on all speakers allowed to address the campus, it would and should be free to do so.

Everything is frozen in the depth of this cold snap.

As I walk the only sound for miles is the crunching of my snowshoes in the snow. I look around and the snow is glistening and the trees are blanketed in snow. I am deeply grateful to be part of this scene.

My silent appreciation is abruptly shattered as something furry comes crashing towards me, ungracefully sliding into my legs. It's my dog Mischa "moon howler" who's come from her patrol of the woods to say hello and help with the chores. She loves this land as much as I do, maybe more.

I laugh and pet her head and she accompanies me as I make my way to the chicken coop and then the wood furnace. I toss a few logs on the fire and then we part ways. Mischa races back into the woods to patrol and I head inside greeted by the aroma of freshly brewed coffee.

There are a lot of moments just like this and I appreciate every one of them.

The best thing I have learned since moving to this homestead is the art of slowing down, seeing and appreciating everything. It seems as though my natural senses have awakened and I feel more connected to everything around me. This land nourishes me and I do my best to nourish it. The canvas and brush strokes are forever changing and it never ceases to be remarkable. We spend so much time searching for things to complete us all the while ignoring and moving too fast to see the gift that is right before us.

I am grateful.Pre-order Preview: The New Year of Nurgle Begins

Give praise to the Lord of Plagues – a corpulent cornucopia of new models, rules and more approaches to kick off your new year.

Next week, you'll be able to pre-order the first wave of all the Nurgle-y goodness we've been previewing here on Warhammer Community, kicking off with one of Warhammer's most iconic Daemons – the Great Unclean One:

As well as being packed with new customisation options, weapons – and, of course, Nurglings – this set also allows you to build Rotigus, a terrifying Greater Daemon of Nurgle similar in stature to (but greater in bulk than!) Kairos Fateweaver or Skarbrand.

Of course, it's not just Nurgle's greatest minions – next week also sees the pre-order of a range of Nurgle Heralds. We've looked at the Spoilpox Scrivener – a vile creature that bullies Plaguebearers into fighting harder on the battlefield – and we think he's a great addition to any Nurgle collection, but did you know that you'll also be able to pick up Horticulous Slimux separately? As well as being a great option in the new Nurgle battletome (and even featuring some upgraded abilities), Horticulous will now be available in Warhammer 40,000 thanks to the new Chaos Daemons codex.

Codex: Chaos Daemons and Battletome: Maggotkin of Nurgle will kick off next year's new rules, and are both packed with new ways to play your Chaos army. If you've not checked out our previews of the books yet, make sure you do – there's a lot to look forward to in each, whether you've already started your army or you're looking for a new one in the new year.

Finally, the Feculent Gnarlmaw will be available next week, allowing you to cap off your Nurgle collection with some thematic scenery (and some handy in-game effects, too). You can find out more about it in our preview, here.

Let us know what you're most excited about on the Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Age of Sigmar Facebook pages.The Seventh Day of Nurgle: The Feculent Gnarlmaw

We've seen beasts, Daemons and monsters great and small in our 7 Days of Nurgle previews, and today, we're looking at some special new Nurgle scenery that's on the way – the Feculent Gnarlmaw.

The Feculent Gnarlmaw is a new piece of terrain for both Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Age of Sigmar. As well as allowing you to build appropriately grotesque gaming tables, the Feculent Gnarlmaw has a suite of special rules to support a Nurgle army, and work particularly well with Horticulous Slimux, who can cause them to sprout up mid-game.

Finally, here's your last wallpaper – download it free here.

Day 7: Feculent GnarlmawThanks mostly to President Trump, Democrats believe they are poised for good things in 2018: the possibility of taking control of the House and gains elsewhere in the midterm elections. But planning victory laps would be premature. Whatever their prospects for the fall campaigns, the Democrats are still in need of renovation and renewal.

Many current indicators point to rough days ahead for the Republicans, unless passage of the tax bill somehow changes their fortunes. From the president's low approval ratings to the high energy among rank-and-file Democrats, as well as recent polls showing that the public prefers Democratic candidates for the House by a sizable margin, there is ample evidence that the GOP faces a typically bad midterm election year, or possibly worse. One caveat to all that: In the era of Trump, traditional metrics should not be taken for granted.

The Democrats need a net gain of 24 seats to take control of the House and a net of two to secure the majority in the Senate. The Cook Political Report lists 17 Republican-held seats as toss-ups and one as leaning to the Democrats. Another 22 GOP seats are in the "lean Republican" category, meaning they are at risk next year. In contrast, Cook's team lists just four Democratic seats as toss-ups and five as "lean Democrat."

The Senate remains a heavier lift, largely because Democrats are defending far more seats and have only a few opportunities to take away GOP-held seats.

The ample availability of competitive House districts is one reason there is a growing consensus, or at least a rising chorus among the political class, proclaiming a tsunami-in-the-making across America. If that turns out to be the case, Democrats would have the power to frustrate Trump's and the GOP's agenda while putting the president himself under a microscope. Many Democrats salivate at the prospect.

A Democratic takeover of the House would transform the politics of Washington. But would it necessarily represent a transformation of the Democratic Party? As with all midterm elections, particularly those that take place in a president's first term, such a result would say much more about perceptions of Trump and his party than being an affirmation of the Democratic Party.

Despite the positive indicators about the midterms, Democrats face questions about their future as a party that now controls nothing in Washington and far less in the states than they did at the beginning of Barack Obama's presidency. Among those questions are such basics as their agenda, their geographic limitations and their leadership.

Democrats could assume they can push those vulnerabilities to the sidelines during a midterm election year with a campaign message that is almost exclusively anti-Trump. But as even many Democrats acknowledge, something more than that will be needed to regain widespread trust of voters across the country and begin the process of rebuilding the party in places where it suffered losses over the past decade.

Democrats stand for many things that are popular with a majority of Americans. They oppose cutting tax rates for the wealthiest taxpayers. They oppose changes to Medicare and Social Security that would reduce future benefits or notably alter the eligibility requirements. And they want some immigrants, known as "dreamers," to be able to stay in this country and not face the threat of deportation over the fact that they were brought to the United States illegally by their parents.

But there are hard questions for the Democrats. What exactly is their health-care policy likely to be in the future? Stand pat with the 2010 Affordable Care Act after some modifications? Move toward a single-payer plan, as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and others now advocate?

What is their economic policy, other than rhetoric about helping working families? What is their response to concerns among many workers about the impact of globalization — more free trade or a rollback? What about cultural issues that are vitally important to a substantial portion of the party's base but that play less well with others who have defected to the Republican Party?

Hillary Clinton learned in 2016 that a laundry list of programs does not necessarily translate into a compelling message. Democrats recoil at Trump's "Make America Great Again" slogan as one that would take the country back to a time when women and minorities had fewer rights and opportunities, but Democrats also continue to struggle to enunciate a new America message that resonates powerfully, especially between the East and West coasts.

The party's geographical challenges will be put to the test starting in 2018. One reason for Democrats' optimism is that there are more than a dozen vulnerable House seats in blue states and several others in suburban areas in states Trump won but that have gone Democratic in the past. A fuller test of the party's ability to rebuild will come in gubernatorial races in the Midwest.

Among states in that region with contests in 2018, Republicans hold the governorships in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois and Iowa. The Democrats' best opportunity will be in Illinois, their worst in Iowa. Democrats also must defend governorships in Pennsylvania and Minnesota. Those results, along with the outcome of legislative races in those industrial and Midwestern battlegrounds, will offer clues about the rebirth of the party.

The party's leadership also is an issue of concern. In the House, the top three Democratic leaders are in their late 70s. In the Senate, the two top leaders are in their late 60s or early 70s. None shows signs of stepping back.

Among the party's prospective presidential candidates, Sanders is 76, former vice president Joe Biden is 75, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is 68. Who among them will run in 2020 isn't known, but one issue for Democratic voters that year will be whether they are prepared to look to a different generation.

Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont and former chair of the Democratic National Committee, has been a one-person chorus calling for a generational change in leadership for his party in 2020. He has said he would like to see his party nominate someone age 55 or younger, preferably 50 or younger. His argument is that the party needs a new-generation leader who can speak to the future more authentically than someone a decade or two older.

Dean noted that younger Americans — say, under 35 — are one of the most important constituencies for Democrats (those younger than 30 voted better than 2-to-1 for Virginia Gov.-elect Ralph Northam in November). But Dean recognizes that these younger voters are more loosely aligned to political parties than older generations, and organize and mobilize differently than past generations.

He believes it will be essential to find a presidential candidate who both reflects those attitudes and can energize those younger voters. "You've got to have a candidate who really turns people on, and I think somebody much closer to this generation would be this person," Dean said in a telephone interview on Friday.

Democrats see a divided Republican Party led by Trump as an easy target for criticism. For now, that will remain the principal focus heading into the midterm elections. But as they begin what amounts to a three-year campaign cycle of midterm elections followed by a critically important 2020 presidential race, will Democrats be forthright in assessing and dealing with their own vulnerabilities?The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, used FBI data to track police officer deaths in the line of duty from 1996 to 2010. They cross-referenced this with state-level gun ownership rates as measured in a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey that asked about gun ownership from 2001 to 2004. To isolate, as accurately as possible, the effects of gun ownership on police officer homicides, they corrected for a number of factors that could also affect police officer homicide rates: overall rates of violent and property crime, the racial and economic demographics of the different states, income, education, alcohol consumption and rural/urban population breakdowns.

AD

They then compared officer fatality rates in the eight states with the lowest public gun ownership rate (13.5 percent, on average) against officer fatalities in the 23 states with the highest gun ownership rate (52 percent, on average). The states with the lowest rates of gun ownership tended to be high-population places such as New York, while the highest rates of gun ownership were in low-population places such as Wyoming. So the researchers compared the 8 "low" states with 23 "high" states to arrive at comparable numbers of law enforcement officers employed in each group over the study period.

The results were shocking: line-of-duty homicide rates among police officers were more than three times higher in states with high gun ownership compared with the low gun ownership states. Between 1996 and 2010, in other words, there were 0.31 officer fatalities for every 10,000 employed officers in low gun ownership states. But there were 0.95 fatalities per 10,000 officers in the high gun ownership states.

"Higher levels of private firearm ownership likely increased the frequency with which officers faced potentially life-threatening situations on the job," the study says. High rates of officer homicides appeared to be caused "by more frequently encountering situations where privately owned firearms were present," it says.

AD

AD

Law enforcement officers "working in states with higher levels of gun ownership faced a greater likelihood of being shot and killed on the job compared with their peers in states with lower gun ownership," the study concludes. The relationship was strong enough that every 10 percent increase in gun ownership correlated with 10 more officer deaths over the study period.

"If we're interested in protecting police officers, we need to look at what's killing them, and what's killing them is guns," said the study's lead author, David Swedler, in a statement last year.

As with all studies, this one has its limitations. Because it only looked at correlations between gun ownership and officer death rates, it can't definitively say whether some other unseen factor may have been driving both.

AD

But the numbers are highly suggestive given the robustness of the findings against all of the potentially confounding factors the researchers did control for. Numbers such as these are one reason many law enforcement groups have been the staunchest supporters of stricter gun control measures.

AD

The International Association of Chiefs of Police, for instance, supports a reinstatement of the federal ban on assault weapons, broadening background checks and creating a national gun offender registry. The Major Cities Chiefs Association, representing police chiefs in the country's largest cities and metro areas, support similar proposals.

By contrast sheriff's groups, which tend to represent law enforcement officers from more rural areas where gun violence is less of a problem, tend to be more skeptical of stricter gun control measures.

AD

The mass shooting attack in Dallas was carried out by one or more assailants armed with what appeared to be assault-style rifles, such as the ones used in seven of the eight other most recent mass shootings in the U.S. These rifles have become very popular among gun enthusiasts in recent years, with the NRA estimating that there are millions in circulation and hundreds of thousands more manufactured each year.

AD

But their increasing use in horrific acts of violence, culminating in the recent shooting of a dozen police officers, underscores the risk these guns pose on officer safety when placed in the wrong hands. And the growing popularity of the weapons suggests that the average beat cop — often armed with only a handgun — may be outgunned by an assailant carrying a military-style rifle designed for use on the battlefield.

ADRep. Devin Nunes, once sidelined by an ethics inquiry from leading the House Intelligence Committee's Russia probe, is reasserting the full authority of his position as chairman just as the GOP appears poised to challenge special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation of possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.

The California Republican was cleared in December of allegations he improperly disclosed classified information while accusing the Obama administration of exposing the identities of Trump affiliates on surveillance reports. Since clearing his name, Nunes has stepped up his attacks on Mueller's team and the law enforcement agencies around it, including convening a group of Intelligence Committee Republicans to draft a likely report on "corruption" among the investigators working for the special counsel.

Although Nunes has not officially wrested his panel's Russia probe back from the Republicans he deputized to run it, the chairman's reemergence as a combative Trump loyalist has raised alarm among Democrats that the future of the investigation may be clipped short or otherwise undermined. Even some of Nunes's GOP allies have expressed concern about his tactics, prompting rare public warnings that he should temper his attacks on federal law enforcement.

[No longer a 'lonely battle': How the campaign against the Mueller probe has taken hold]

"I'm interested in getting access to the information and not the drama," Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) said last month, when Nunes began threatening contempt citations for FBI Director Christopher A. Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein in the wake of revelations that former Mueller team members had exchanged ­anti-Trump texts.

More recently, Gowdy said that his "heart would be broken" if Nunes follows through on reported plans to issue a corruption exposé about the FBI, citing concerns that issuing such a report outside the context of a comprehensive investigation of the Justice Department could prove damaging to law enforcement.

Gowdy, a member of the Intelligence panel who also chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, suggested that Nunes has taken some of these steps without the express blessing of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who has been involved in crafting the GOP's multipronged approach to examining a string of allegations from Russian election interference to alleged mismanagement at the nation's top law enforcement agencies.

A spokesman for Nunes declined to comment.

But Nunes's moves coincide with what Democrats say is a coordinated GOP effort to shutter the House Intelligence Committee's Russia probe, publicly absolve President Trump of the most serious allegations against him, and refocus the House's resources against the law enforcement officials, such as Mueller, who continue to investigate Trump.

For months, Democrats have kept an unofficial count of the ways they say Nunes worked behind the scenes during the time he was under ethics investigation to slow or stymie the Intelligence Committee's Russia probe. Nunes never relinquished his sole, unchecked authority to sign off on subpoenas even as he handed the day-to-day operations to Reps. K. Michael Conaway (R-Tex.), Gowdy and Thomas J. Rooney (R-Fla.). People familiar with the committee's work estimated that Nunes's effective veto cost Democrats dozens of requests for interviews and documents that were never sent out, despite repeated entreaties from the minority side.

This includes requests for subpoenas to obtain additional testimony from key figures in the probe who Democrats say were not forthcoming enough in interviews — among them Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. Democrats surmise they might have compelled them to return if not for Nunes's resistance.

Republicans have dismissed such complaints as political posturing. Conaway said that he has received every subpoena approval he has requested from Nunes, while others pointed to the steady stream of witnesses who sat for interviews with the Intelligence Committee — and challenged Democrats to name who they say is missing.

"Adam's list is pretty much every character in any Dostoevsky or Tolstoy novel," Gowdy said, referring to the Intelligence panel's top Democrat, Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California. "I get the intrigue and the mystery of these unusual-sounding names, but at some point you have to tie it back to what we're looking at."

"You can interview anybody that's ever met a Russian in the government and it's not going to get you any closer," said Rooney. "Ten months, how many witnesses? I want to know, ask them how much longer they want to go. How many more witnesses do they need to hear, and specifically which witnesses, and why?"

But to Democrats, the march of witnesses in and out of the committee's secure interview facility in the U.S. Capitol building basement has provided little assurance the probe is being run properly.

The packed schedule, sometimes featuring two or three overlapping interviews per day, has sparked complaints from Democrats that it is impossible to fully prepare for or monitor the investigation's progress. Even when members are able to focus on one witness at a time, people familiar with the probe said, relevant requested documents often fail to materialize until after the interview has concluded — and the interviewees are hardly ever invited back.

The order of interviews has also been a point of ongoing dispute. While Senate Intelligence Committee leaders boast of a methodical process that starts with peripheral players and builds to key witnesses, the House Intelligence Committee's order is comparatively haphazard and unstructured — almost designed, critics say, to give the probe a "veneer of respectability" while effectively giving investigators whiplash.

Nunes's hand in such decisions was never direct, people familiar with the probe said. During the period he was under an Ethics Committee investigation, he never once attended a closed-door meeting at which the Russia probe was discussed — something both his allies and critics attest to. But at least one of his senior committee staff members was always present at such sessions to help update members, question witnesses and otherwise run the probe, multiple people said. Even Republicans acknowledge it was difficult to distinguish between staff members' allegiance to the committee and their loyalties to Nunes.

"I don't know where his staff ends and HPSCI" begins, Gowdy said, referring to the House Intelligence committee by its official acronym. "Some of them are apolitical nonpartisan members of his staff, and I'm not smart enough to know who's what."

Once the House Intelligence Committee concludes its investigation, it is unclear what precise role remains for Nunes in the House GOP's continued push to investigate allegations of bias and other misconduct in law enforcement. The House Committee on Oversight and the Judiciary Committee have already launched an inquiry into the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe. And a joint investigation by Nunes and Gowdy into the Justice Department and FBI's review of circumstances surrounding an Obama-era deal giving Russia a stake in the American uranium market seems to have lost its initial momentum.

If there is one aspect of the Russia probe that seems destined to outlast the House Intelligence Committee's preferred timeline, it is Nunes's investigation of Fusion GPS, the firm behind a dossier detailing Trump's alleged connections to Russian officials, financiers and exploits in Moscow. Nunes's subpoena of the firm's bank records is caught up in a court battle, and the chairman's staff is in touch with the office of Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), according to the senator, who is also looking into reports that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party paid for research that ended up in the dossier's pages.

The dossier continues to be a focus of the president in tweet storms seeking to discredit Mueller's probe. Most recently, he blasted the FBI for focusing on the "Crooked Hillary pile of garbage" dossier "as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign." In recent weeks, he has also tweeted encouragement of Nunes's efforts to unearth information about the dossier from the "deep state."

Nunes, meanwhile, appears to have made up his mind about the House Intelligence Committee probe into the allegations surrounding Trump and Russia, expressing his convictions in an interview with Fox News.

"We have no evidence of Russia collusion between the Trump campaign" and Russia, Nunes said.

The group includes "doctors, members of industry, members of the community and, very importantly, people living with HIV," Scott Schoettes, a lawyer with the LGBT rights organization Lambda Legal, told The Post. "Without it, you lose the community voice in policymaking." Schoettes was one of the council members who resigned in June.

AD

The latest move was met with sharp rebukes from organizations that work on issues related to HIV/AIDS. The White House has not responded to a request for comment.

Sarah Ellis, president and chief executive of GLAAD, a LGBT rights advocacy organization, said Trump's move was part of pattern to leave LBGTQ people behind.

"Trump began the month by erasing LGBTQ people from his World AIDS Day statement, and ends it by firing all remaining members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS without warning," she said. "In his first year in office, President Trump has made a continuous effort to erase LGBTQ people and people living with HIV from the fabric of our country — actions that fly in the face of American values and that all fair-minded Americans will continue to push back against in the new year."

AD

Phill Wilson, president and chief executive of the nonprofit Black AIDS Institute, spoke on a Washington Post panel this month about the broad impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, saying "we're all impacted by the disease, and the response to it is the responsibility of all of us." His organization said on Facebook that Trump's latest move especially affects black Americans:

"45 continues his utter disregard for HIV/AIDS issues and subsequently Black Americans who are the most affected. He has fired the remaining 16 members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS."

AD

Trump's decision was unusual in timing and concerning considering his inaction on other issues related to HIV/AIDS, William McColl, AIDS United vice president for policy and advocacy, told The Fix in a statement:

"While AIDS United recognizes that it is within the Trump administration's purview to appoint PACHA members, and previous new administrations also asked for the resignations of entire council memberships, we are very concerned about the timing and lack of transparency surrounding today's dismissals. Most new administrations appoint their own councils early in their terms, not after almost a year in office. Additionally, it is quite unusual to take such action between Christmas and New Year's, when much of Washington is closed and their PACHA members are home celebrating the holidays with loved ones."

AD

Trump has found himself in the headlines recently over several alleged comments — or the lack of — related to HIV and AIDS. The New York Times reported that the president "grumbled" about 15,000 Haitian immigrants coming to the U.S. since the beginning of the year. They "all have AIDS," he said, according to one person who attended the meeting and another person who was briefed about it by a different person who was there. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denied the comments.

AD

Trump was criticized earlier this month for his World AIDS Day pronouncement that did not acknowledge how blacks are disproportionately affected by the illness. Nearly half — 48 percent — of those diagnosed with AIDS in the United States are African Americans, according to 2015 statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson wrote that America's legacy of combating AIDS globally is "at risk" under Trump: "The Trump administration's 2018 budget proposes cutting $800 million in America's bilateral HIV/AIDS programs. And neither South Africa nor Nigeria would be in the 'priority' category in the State Department's new AIDS strategy, despite together being home to about a quarter of the AIDS cases in the world."

AD

Democratic Coalition co-founder Scott Dworkin chastised Trump for the way members of the HIV/AIDS council were let go this week.

AD

"Trump fired every single member of his HIV/AIDS council without telling them why," he tweeted. "Not only that, he did it in a letter sent via FedEx. He didn't even pick up the phone & call them. Laziest & most cruel president in the history of the United States-and obviously a complete coward."

Activists claim that much of the progress in the global fight against AIDS was made in part because of the support from the Oval Office. Trump's approach leaves those concerned about the future of the disease with more questions than answers. And at worst, these questions appear to stoke fears that progress could be undone without the support of the White House.

ADGraham warned that North Korea is watching how the United States conducts itself as protests in Iran continue for a third day, and he said that Trump's tweeting of support for the Iranian people is not an adequate response.

AD

"The Iranians are watching us in North Korea, and North Korea is watching us in Iran," Graham said in an interview with CBS's "Face the Nation." "We've got a chance here to deliver some fatal blows to really bad actors in 2018, but if we blink, God help us all."

AD

Graham spoke after two Iranian demonstrators were confirmed killed in the protests, which began Thursday in response to economic problems in the country. The demonstrations have since broadened into condemnation of the political and cultural repression in Iran.

Trump has tweeted several times in support of the demonstrators, writing Sunday that the United States is "watching very closely for human rights violations."

AD

But Graham, who called the protests evidence of former president Barack Obama's foreign policy failures, said it's "not enough to watch" and post on Twitter.

"President Trump is tweeting very sympathetically to the Iranian people, but you just can't tweet here. You have to lay out a plan. If I were President Trump, I'd lay out a plan as to how I would engage the regime."

On domestic policy, Graham said Congress should reach a deal on immigration, a border wall and the status of "dreamers" — undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children — in January. He predicted that Republicans and Democrats will not "come together" on health care in 2018.

ADGraham warned that North Korea is watching how the United States conducts itself as protests in Iran continue for a third day, and he said that Trump's tweeting of support for the Iranian people is not an adequate response.

"The Iranians are watching us in North Korea, and North Korea is watching us in Iran," Graham said in an interview with CBS's "Face the Nation." "We've got a chance here to deliver some fatal blows to really bad actors in 2018, but if we blink, God help us all."

Graham spoke after two Iranian demonstrators were confirmed killed in the protests, which began Thursday in response to economic problems in the country. The demonstrations have since broadened into condemnation of the political and cultural repression in Iran.

Trump has tweeted several times in support of the demonstrators, writing Sunday that the United States is "watching very closely for human rights violations."

Daniel Kahneman, who won a Nobel Prize in economics for reshaping our understanding of human motivation, once said: "No one ever made a decision because of a number. They need a story." That's as true for nations as for individuals. Countries have always oriented themselves within a larger international story. But what is today's global story?

For decades, the great overarching narrative was the Cold War. Almost every nation acted or reacted in the context of that ideological, political and military struggle. Then came 1989 and the collapse of communism. For the next 20 years or so, the opening up of the world — globalization — became the dominant thread, as countries jostled to become hot new markets and Western democratic capitalism seemed inevitable, undergirded by U.S. power and prestige. The attacks of 9/11 dealt a sharp blow to this benign narrative and, for a while, Islamist terrorism seemed to be steering the course of history. But terrorism has proved too weak and limited a force to be the big global story.

So what is it now? I would argue that the largest trend today is the decline of American influence. Not the decline of American power — the country remains economically and militarily in a league of its own — but a decline of its desire and capacity to use that power to shape the world. The current administration seems intent on dismantling the United States' great achievements — as it is doing with the World Trade Organization — or to simply be uninterested in setting the global agenda. Donald Trump will be the first president in nearly a century to end his first year in office without having held a state dinner for a foreign head of state.

And this erosion of U.S. global leadership is already causing other countries to adjust.

This month, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel declared that "the most important changes affecting our Western world and, indeed, the world as a whole" stem from "the United States' current withdrawal under Trump from its role as a reliable guarantor of Western-influenced multilateralism." That shift, he noted, "is accelerating the transformation of the global order . . . and the risk of trade wars, arms races and armed conflicts is increasing."

For Europe, Gabriel argued, the situation is almost existential. Since the end of World War II, he said, "Europe had been an American project in the United States' clearly understood interests. However, the current U.S. administration now perceives Europe in a very distanced way, regarding previous partners as competitors and sometimes even as at the very least economic opponents." He urged Europe to take its fate into its own hands and decouple itself from U.S. foreign policy.

Consider also the speech in June by Canada's foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, in which she thanked the United States for its seven-decade-long stewardship of the international system and strongly implied that, under the Trump administration, American leadership of that system had reached its end.

Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a speech to the 19th Communist Party Congress in October that reflected his recognition of these new realities. "China's international standing has risen as never before," he noted, and the nation is "blazing a new trail for other developing countries to achieve modernization." Xi announced "a new era . . . that sees China moving closer to center stage and making greater contributions to mankind." In previous speeches, he suggested boldly that China would become the new guarantor of the global trading order.

This, then, is the global story of our times. The creator, upholder and enforcer of the existing international system is withdrawing into self-centered isolation. The other great supporter and advocate of the open, rule-based world, Europe, has not been able to act assertively on the world stage with any clear vision or purpose and remains obsessed with the fate of its own continental project. Filling the power vacuum, a host of smaller, illiberal powers — Turkey, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia — are surging forward in their respective regions. But only China truly has the wherewithal and strategic prowess to potentially shape the next chapter of the story of our age.

A decade ago, I described a "post- ­American world," brought on not by the decline of the United States, but by the "rise of the rest." That world is indeed coming to fruition because other countries are prospering, but the changes are being dramatically accelerated by the Trump administration's foolish and self-defeating decision to abdicate the United States' global influence — something that has taken more than 70 years to build. As the president might tweet, "Sad!"

Devin Nunes, once sidelined by an ethics inquiry from leading the House Intelligence Committee's Russia probe, is reasserting the full authority of his position as chairman just as the GOP appears poised to challenge special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation of possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.

The California Republican was cleared in December of allegations he improperly disclosed classified information while accusing the Obama administration of exposing the identities of Trump affiliates on surveillance reports. Since clearing his name, Nunes has stepped up his attacks on Mueller's team and the law enforcement agencies around it, including convening a group of Intelligence Committee Republicans to draft a likely report on "corruption" among the investigators working for the special counsel.

Although Nunes has not officially wrested his panel's Russia probe back from the Republicans he deputized to run it, the chairman's reemergence as a combative Trump loyalist has raised alarm among Democrats that the future of the investigation may be clipped short or otherwise undermined. Even some of Nunes's GOP allies have expressed concern about his tactics, prompting rare public warnings that he should temper his attacks on federal law enforcement.

[No longer a 'lonely battle': How the campaign against the Mueller probe has taken hold]

"I'm interested in getting access to the information and not the drama," Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) said last month, when Nunes began threatening contempt citations for FBI Director Christopher A. Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein in the wake of revelations that former Mueller team members had exchanged ­anti-Trump texts.

More recently, Gowdy said that his "heart would be broken" if Nunes follows through on reported plans to issue a corruption exposé about the FBI, citing concerns that issuing such a report outside the context of a comprehensive investigation of the Justice Department could prove damaging to law enforcement.

Gowdy, a member of the Intelligence panel who also chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, suggested that Nunes has taken some of these steps without the express blessing of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who has been involved in crafting the GOP's multipronged approach to examining a string of allegations from Russian election interference to alleged mismanagement at the nation's top law enforcement agencies.

A spokesman for Nunes declined to comment.

But Nunes's moves coincide with what Democrats say is a coordinated GOP effort to shutter the House Intelligence Committee's Russia probe, publicly absolve President Trump of the most serious allegations against him, and refocus the House's resources against the law enforcement officials, such as Mueller, who continue to investigate Trump.

For months, Democrats have kept an unofficial count of the ways they say Nunes worked behind the scenes during the time he was under ethics investigation to slow or stymie the Intelligence Committee's Russia probe. Nunes never relinquished his sole, unchecked authority to sign off on subpoenas even as he handed the day-to-day operations to Reps. K. Michael Conaway (R-Tex.), Gowdy and Thomas J. Rooney (R-Fla.). People familiar with the committee's work estimated that Nunes's effective veto cost Democrats dozens of requests for interviews and documents that were never sent out, despite repeated entreaties from the minority side.

This includes requests for subpoenas to obtain additional testimony from key figures in the probe who Democrats say were not forthcoming enough in interviews — among them Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. Democrats surmise they might have compelled them to return if not for Nunes's resistance.

Republicans have dismissed such complaints as political posturing. Conaway said that he has received every subpoena approval he has requested from Nunes, while others pointed to the steady stream of witnesses who sat for interviews with the Intelligence Committee — and challenged Democrats to name who they say is missing.

"Adam's list is pretty much every character in any Dostoevsky or Tolstoy novel," Gowdy said, referring to the Intelligence panel's top Democrat, Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California. "I get the intrigue and the mystery of these unusual-sounding names, but at some point you have to tie it back to what we're looking at."

"You can interview anybody that's ever met a Russian in the government and it's not going to get you any closer," said Rooney. "Ten months, how many witnesses? I want to know, ask them how much longer they want to go. How many more witnesses do they need to hear, and specifically which witnesses, and why?"

But to Democrats, the march of witnesses in and out of the committee's secure interview facility in the U.S. Capitol building basement has provided little assurance the probe is being run properly.

The packed schedule, sometimes featuring two or three overlapping interviews per day, has sparked complaints from Democrats that it is impossible to fully prepare for or monitor the investigation's progress. Even when members are able to focus on one witness at a time, people familiar with the probe said, relevant requested documents often fail to materialize until after the interview has concluded — and the interviewees are hardly ever invited back.

The order of interviews has also been a point of ongoing dispute. While Senate Intelligence Committee leaders boast of a methodical process that starts with peripheral players and builds to key witnesses, the House Intelligence Committee's order is comparatively haphazard and unstructured — almost designed, critics say, to give the probe a "veneer of respectability" while effectively giving investigators whiplash.

Nunes's hand in such decisions was never direct, people familiar with the probe said. During the period he was under an Ethics Committee investigation, he never once attended a closed-door meeting at which the Russia probe was discussed — something both his allies and critics attest to. But at least one of his senior committee staff members was always present at such sessions to help update members, question witnesses and otherwise run the probe, multiple people said. Even Republicans acknowledge it was difficult to distinguish between staff members' allegiance to the committee and their loyalties to Nunes.

"I don't know where his staff ends and HPSCI" begins, Gowdy said, referring to the House Intelligence committee by its official acronym. "Some of them are apolitical nonpartisan members of his staff, and I'm not smart enough to know who's what."

Once the House Intelligence Committee concludes its investigation, it is unclear what precise role remains for Nunes in the House GOP's continued push to investigate allegations of bias and other misconduct in law enforcement. The House Committee on Oversight and the Judiciary Committee have already launched an inquiry into the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe. And a joint investigation by Nunes and Gowdy into the Justice Department and FBI's review of circumstances surrounding an Obama-era deal giving Russia a stake in the American uranium market seems to have lost its initial momentum.

If there is one aspect of the Russia probe that seems destined to outlast the House Intelligence Committee's preferred timeline, it is Nunes's investigation of Fusion GPS, the firm behind a dossier detailing Trump's alleged connections to Russian officials, financiers and exploits in Moscow. Nunes's subpoena of the firm's bank records is caught up in a court battle, and the chairman's staff is in touch with the office of Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), according to the senator, who is also looking into reports that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party paid for research that ended up in the dossier's pages.

The dossier continues to be a focus of the president in tweet storms seeking to discredit Mueller's probe. Most recently, he blasted the FBI for focusing on the "Crooked Hillary pile of garbage" dossier "as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign." In recent weeks, he has also tweeted encouragement of Nunes's efforts to unearth information about the dossier from the "deep state."

Nunes, meanwhile, appears to have made up his mind about the House Intelligence Committee probe into the allegations surrounding Trump and Russia, expressing his convictions in an interview with Fox News.

"We have no evidence of Russia collusion between the Trump campaign" and Russia, Nunes said.

Nearly a year into his takeover of Washington, President Trump has made a significant down payment on his campaign pledge to shrink the federal bureaucracy, a shift long sought by conservatives that could eventually bring the workforce down to levels not seen in decades.

By the end of September, all Cabinet departments except Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs and Interior had fewer permanent staff than when Trump took office in January — with most shedding many hundreds of employees, according to an analysis of federal personnel data by The Washington Post.

The diminishing federal footprint comes after Trump promised in last year's campaign to "cut so much your head will spin," and it reverses a boost in hiring under President Barack Obama. The falloff has been driven by an exodus of civil servants, a diminished corps of political appointees and an effective hiring freeze.

Even though Congress did not pass a new budget in his first year, the drastic spending cuts Trump laid out in the spring — which would slash more than 30 percent of funding at some agencies — also has triggered a spending slowdown, according to officials at multiple departments.

The White House is now warning agencies to brace for even deeper cuts in the 2019 budget it will announce early next year, part of an effort to lower the federal deficit to pay for the new tax law, according to officials briefed on the budgets for their agencies. One possible casualty: a pay raise that federal employees historically have received when the economy is humming.

The administration's effort so far to reshape the workforce of nearly 2 million civil servants that serves as the backbone of the government already has provoked a contentious culture shift.

Federal workers fret that their jobs could be zeroed out amid buyouts and early retirement offers that already have prompted hundreds of their colleagues to leave, according to interviews with three dozen employees across the government. Many chafed as supervisors laid down new rules they said are aimed at holding poor performers and problem workers to account.

A hiring freeze technically lifted in the spring has been kept in practice at most agencies, hollowing out many offices. And the slow pace of political appointments has left a number of departments with a leadership vacuum in their upper ranks.

"Morale has never been lower," said Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 federal workers at more than 30 agencies. "Government is making itself a lot less attractive as an employer."

[Trump's priorities in funding and cutting are keenly felt by federal workforce]

Administration officials said that Trump has actually improved employee morale, citing an annual survey of federal workers taken in the spring that showed a slight uptick across most agencies. They said they are streamlining the government to make it leaner and more effective.

In a statement, White House spokesman Raj Shah said Trump "is committed to streamlining government for the 21st century, reducing bloat, duplication and waste, and focusing resources on key priorities like public safety and protecting our nation's homeland."

Conservatives who have long pushed for smaller government are cheered by the developments.

"This is going very well," said anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, who famously once quipped that he wanted to shrink government small enough so he could "drown it in the bathtub."

"Slow and steady — for all the bluster, this is how you downsize government without engendering blowback," Norquist added.

And some civil servants said they welcome the focus on rooting out waste and holding federal workers to high standards.

"Oftentimes we run on autopilot and continue to fund programs that don't produce the results that were intended," said Stephanie Valentine, a program analyst at the Education Department. "You can't keep blindly spending because that's what we've always done."

Trump already has begun to reverse the growth of the Obama era, when the government added a total of 188,000 permanent employees, according to Office of Personnel Management data.

By the end of September, the federal government had 1.94 million permanent workers, down nearly 16,000 overall since the beginning of the year, according to the most recent OPM data. In the first nine months of 2009, Obama's first year in office, the government added 68,000 permanent employees, growing to 1.84 million.

The last time federal employment dropped during a president's first year, President Bill Clinton was in the White House.

The relatively small net decrease under Trump so far masks what has been a substantial drop-off in staffing at certain agencies.

One of the biggest reductions has been at the Bureau of Prisons, which lost 2,320 permanent workers at a time when the Justice Department plans to return to using private prisons to house some federal inmates. (A spokesman said the staffing decline was largely due to attrition and hiring delays.) The Census Bureau, which has not received its full budget request from Congress for multiple years, fell by more than 1,000 employees. The Environmental Protection Agency, where Administrator Scott Pruitt has moved quickly to reverse a generation of environmental protections and rules, was down 508 employees.

The shrinking federal workforce could end up undercutting some of Trump's priorities. Employment within the Defense Department, which Trump has promised to beef up, dropped by 1 percent, or 7,811 civilian workers across all branches of the military.

And the Internal Revenue Service, which is charged with the complex task of implementing Trump's tax overhaul plan, lost 6,801 permanent staffers in the first nine months of this year, a drop of nearly 9 percent, personnel data shows.

To the exits

There are signs that Trump's polarizing presidency has helped drive more civil servants to the exits this year — voluntary departures that have contributed to the shrinking workforce.

During the first six months of the administration, 71,285 career employees quit or retired. That's up from 50,000 who left during the same period in 2009, according to the most recent OPM data.

Among them is Noah Kunin, the former infrastructure director for 18F, the high-profile office created in the General Services Administration in 2014 to boost the government's digital services.

Kunin said he lost staff who did not want to work for the new administration — and then was unable to replace them because of the early hiring freeze. He said he grew frustrated with what he called a slow start by the White House on bringing private-sector solutions to the government.

"I was involved in several major initiatives, and they were all stalled," he recalled.

When he heard former FBI director James B. Comey tell Congress in June that Trump had asked him for his personal loyalty, Kunin said his red line was crossed.

Now working in Minneapolis as a software consultant, Kunin says the decision was "the most personal choice I've ever made: to stay engaged or leave."

In some agencies, the number of people leaving has been crippling, according to former officials. At the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a wave of recent retirements has depleted the managerial staff at the enforcement agency's 70 field offices, said Jordan Barab, who was a top OSHA official in the Obama administration. In all, the agency shed 119 permanent workers by the end of September, a 6 percent drop, personnel data shows.

"It's starting to create major problems," Barab said. Enforcement actions must be reviewed by supervisors in multiple offices, he said, and if too many months pass, they can be thrown out. "You can't run an enforcement agency with no managers."

A spokesman for the Labor Department declined to comment on the current number of OSHA managers but said that new inspectors have been hired in recent months, helping increase the number of safety and health inspections in 2017 — the first such boost in five years.

Across the government, roughly a third of workers who were hired in 2015 will be eligible to retire by 2020, according to the Government Accountability Office. But one of the best pipelines for getting young talent into the government has languished this year.

The Presidential Management Fellows program, a prestigious internship for top graduate students, has been unable to place many recruits because of a lingering hiring freeze at many agencies, according to a half-dozen current fellows.

Meanwhile, other federal workers are in limbo because their jobs could cease to exist. That's the precarious state right now of the tiny Chemical Safety Board, one of 19 small agencies Trump has marked for elimination.

The $11 million office investigates the causes of major chemical accidents and makes recommendations for safety improvements. In early December, a White House budget official told Chairperson Vanessa Allen Sutherland that because the deficit has grown, the safety board must do its part and prepare to shut down, she said.

So far, no members of Congress have called for the board to be eliminated. But Sutherland is still busy bolstering the spirits of her 43 employees while formulating a shutdown plan. "I think I'll definitely be there to turn out the light switches and take the Styrofoam cups with me," she said.

Slow to appoint

Trump has also moved slowly in appointing the most important personnel in his government: the political leaders who are supposed to be the architects of his vision.

Of 624 key political positions requiring Senate confirmation, just 240 were confirmed as of Friday, according to data tracked by The Washington Post and the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service.

A slow recruitment and vetting process, combined with drawn-out Senate confirmation schedules, stalled the process. As of last week, 79 nominees across the government had waited more than 100 days for a Senate hearing.

But the president has also expressed skepticism that such appointees are valuable.

"I tell my people, 'Where you don't need to fill slots, don't fill them,' " Trump told conservative radio host Laura Ingraham in November.

In the meantime, many agencies have relied heavily on career employees in acting leadership roles. But their leadership can be tentative.

"Some careerists feel paralyzed," said Reginald Wells, who recently retired from the Social Security Administration as human resources chief. "They don't want to make a mistake."

At the Labor Department, most top political posts still lack Trump appointees. For months, Secretary Alexander Acosta's chief of staff doubled up jobs, serving as the department's chief lawyer in an acting capacity until the Senate confirmed Trump's nominee late this month.

The clock ran out for hundreds of acting officials in November when a little-known law called the Vacancies Act — designed to spur presidents to staff their government — kicked in, limiting them from making official decisions.

The law allows acting officials to serve for up to 300 days, at which point they must yield their authority to the agency head, unless the president has nominated someone to the job. An official action taken in violation of the law could face a legal challenge.

That forced a complicated workaround at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, where Deputy Director Thomas Homan has been serving as acting director while he awaits confirmation.

For now, to continue to act as ICE chief, he has been signing his name with this title: deputy director and senior official performing the duties of the director.

Other agencies have been virtually paralyzed without political appointees.

The small Merit Systems Protection Board, which considers appeals from federal employees who believe they were unfairly fired or demoted, has not heard a case in 11 months.

One of Obama's appointees to the three-member board left in January, leaving two vacancies. Trump has yet to nominate anyone to the panel. With no quorum, the lone board member, Republican Mark Robbins, cannot take action on a backlog of more than 700 cases dating to early 2015.

His father jokes that he is a highly paid bureaucrat with nothing to do. But Robbins said he keeps busy reading cases and writing his opinion of each one. Then he carries each file across the hall to two empty offices piled high with legal accordion files, where they await review by future board members.

Robbins insisted that the administration "hasn't been ignoring us," adding that he hopes for a quorum by spring.

Even key White House posts have gone unfilled.

The president still has no science adviser. And the Office of Management and Budget is waiting for the Senate to confirm its nominees for deputy director and controller — vital positions tasked with restructuring the government.

Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), an advocate for modernizing federal technology systems, said that eight of 24 agencies are without chief information officers.

"We're losing momentum in the fight against cyberattacks," he said.

Federal contractors, including defense giant General Dynamics, have complained in earnings calls that leadership vacancies have slowed contract awards and delayed getting money authorized and appropriated.

"It's very important to have senior leaders in place to make those long-term commitments," said Alan Chvotkin, executive vice president of the Professional Services Council, a trade group that represents federal contractors.

Culture shift

For those inside the bureaucracy, a new Trump-era focus on accountability has meant working under greater oversight — and in some cases, fear of reprisals.

Agencies have told employees that they should no longer count on getting glowing reviews in their performance appraisals, according to staff in multiple offices, as has been the case for years.

Housing and Urban Development managers, for example, are being evaluated for the first time on how effectively they address poor performers, according to Ashaki Robinson Johns, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 476, which represents HUD employees.

Telework — a popular Obama-era policy that expanded work from home — has come under scrutiny as Trump officials have questioned whether it is a license to goof off. The Agriculture and Commerce departments are now moving to restrict the flexible work policy, in some offices by half the amount of time previously permitted, according to documents and employees.

A spokesman for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that while he recognizes that telework is widely used in the public and private sectors, he has asked agency heads "to make sure that they have systems in place to assure that management's objectives are met."

[Trump has a plan for government workers. They're not going to like it.]

There are also tensions over forced reassignments for employees whom Trump officials view as out of sync with their agency's priorities.

Matthew Allen, a former Pentagon spokesman and onetime communications chief for the Bureau of Land Management, said he found himself quickly marginalized after he suggested that the bureau should share more public information about its activities.

In late September, he was abruptly transferred to another office and demoted — among dozens of senior executives whom Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke reassigned in the fall. The Interior Department's inspector general is investigating the reassignments.

Allen said he witnessed a "level of paranoia about whistleblowing and information that I've never encountered in all my years of federal service." A spokeswoman for the Interior Department declined to comment, noting that Allen has a pending lawsuit against the agency.

The administration has made its biggest push for employee accountability at Veterans Affairs, which was found in 2014 to have covered up excessive wait times for patients. In June, the president signed a law allowing the agency to fire or demote poor performers or employees accused of misconduct with 15 days' notice.

In a Veterans Day speech at Arlington National Cemetery, Vice President Pence drew applause from the crowd when he said that VA had fired or suspended more than 1,500 employees for negligent behavior.

In a letter to the White House, House Republicans recently asked if other agencies should have the same firing powers.

"The mood is different," said Debra D'Agostino, founding partner of the Federal Practice Group, a law firm representing federal employees. In October alone, the firm took on 30 new clients facing proposed removals — up from the usual one or two a month, she said.

"There's a feeling out there that they're not going to get as much pushback for trying to fire someone," she said.

Some civil servants have sought to stay as a bulwark against changes at their agency.

At Veterans Affairs, John Fuller wrestled with leaving for months. A retired Army major, he's a lifelong Republican who voted for Trump. He has played a pioneering role in the federal government as VA's chief race relations and culture educator, traveling the country to meet with employees in small groups to heal racial divisions.

"I have so much passion for the job left," the 65-year-old said in early December. But Fuller said he was told his travel budget would be shifted to other priorities.

Days before Christmas. Fuller put in his retirement papers. In a letter to VA, he blamed officials for pulling support from what he called "a genuine race relations dialogue" that drew acclaim across the government.

His retirement is effective Jan. 15.

Das Ziel der Polizei steht schon jetzt fest: Eine solche Vielzahl an sexuellen Übergriffen auf junge Frauen wie in der Silvesternacht vor zwei Jahren wollen die Hamburger Sicherheitsbehörden verhindern. Mit nahezu allen Mitteln. In diesem Jahr setzt die Polizei dafür vor allem auf neue Videotechnik an den Brennpunkten Reeperbahn und Jungfernstieg. Polizeipräsident Ralf Martin Meyer ist guter Dinge: "Die Videoüberwachung an diesen Orten wird einen Beitrag dazu leisten, potenzielle Täter von der Begehung von Straftaten abzuhalten."

Was in den ersten Stunden des noch frischen Jahres 2016 in Hamburg an der Großen Freiheit, aber auch in anderen deutschen Großstädten passierte, hatte für das Sicherheitsgefühl vieler Bürger schwerwiegende Folgen – es zeigte erstmals, dass die Polizei einer solchen Vielzahl von massiven Attacken auf friedlich Feierende nicht gewachsen war. Allein in Hamburg meldeten sich später 400 Mädchen und Frauen, die von perfiden sexuellen Übergriffen im Gedränge berichteten. Das Ergebnis der juristischen Aufarbeitung war alles andere als zufriedenstellend: Es gab kaum Verurteilungen der meist jungen Verdächtigen. "So etwas hatten wir zuvor noch nicht erlebt", sagte Polizeisprecher Timo Zill nach den Ereignissen.

Polizei musste Bildmaterial von Partyfotografen nutzen

Ein Problem bei der Aufarbeitung: fehlendes Beweismaterial. Oftmals scheiterte die Identifizierung der Täter, weil die Opfer ihre Peiniger später nicht mehr eindeutig wiedererkennen konnten, die sie aus Gruppen heraus umstellten, bedrängten, sexuell nötigten und teilweise auch beraubten. Die Ermittler mussten sich in weiteten Teilen auf privat angefertigte Fotos stützen. Beispielsweise wurde in einem Prozess gegen einen jungen Iraner das Bildmaterial eines Partyfotografen herangezogen, mit dem auch weitere Täter identifiziert werden sollten.

Doch schon der G-20-Gipfel hat ein Umdenken der Hamburger Polizei hinsichtlich der Videoüberwachung eindrücklich demonstriert. Die kürzlich gestartete Massenfahndung nach potenziellen Tätern zeigte bereits erste Erfolge – sie ist allerdings auch nicht unumstritten. Das gilt auch für die Videoüberwachung im öffentlichen Hamburger Raum: 2010 musste die Polizei die vorhandene Kameraüberwachung auf dem Kiez einschränken, nachdem ein Gericht Anwohnerbeschwerden recht gab.

Auch der Jungfernstieg wird jetzt videoüberwacht Quelle: Jakob Koch

Für die kommende Silvesternacht setzt die Polizei auf eine Mischung aus festinstallierten Kameras und mobiler Videotechnik. Neben drei Videokameras, die auf Beatles-Platz, Talstraße und Hamburger Berg installiert worden sind, kann die Polizei ab sofort auch auf sechs Kameras am Jungfernstieg zurückgreifen. Hinzu kommt mobile Videotechnik: Beamte sind mit mehreren Videowagen im Einsatz, zudem tragen Beamte Bodycams am Körper. Damit ist Hamburgs Polizei mit ihrem umfangreichsten Videokonzept auf den Straßen präsent, um Straftaten zu verhindern – und, wenn nötig, für spätere Fahndungen oder Prozesse umfassend zu dokumentieren.

Politisch ist das Thema umkämpft: Bereits seit 2015 fordert die CDU-Bürgerschaftsfraktion die "Wiedereinführung und Ausweitung der Videoüberwachung, nachdem der Senat die vorhandenen Kameras aus politischen Gründen abschalten ließ", betont der innenpolitische Sprecher der Christdemokraten, Dennis Gladiator. Dieser Fehler werde nun viel zu spät korrigiert. "Aber besser spät als nie", erklärt Gladiator. Aus Sicht des CDU-Innenexperten reicht die neue Kameraüberwachung allerdings nicht aus: "Der Videoschutz muss an allen Brennpunkten weiter ausgeweitet werden." Erst kürzlich hatte die Bundespolizei am Hauptbahnhof ihre Videotechnik erweitert. Statt 60 sind es nun 190 Kameras – Kostenpunkt: 1,7 Million Euro.

"Die härteste Nacht des Jahres"

Anzeige

Neben der neuen Videotechnik setzt die Polizei vor allem auf Präsenz von Beamten: Wie vergangenes Jahr, das mit insgesamt 100 Strafanzeigen deutlich ruhiger blieb als das Vorjahr, sollen mehr als 530 Bereitschaftspolizisten an Silvester im Einsatz sein – die Hälfte mehr als noch beim Jahreswechsel 2015/16. Alle sind mit gelben Warnwesten ausgestattet, damit sie schnell zu erkennen sind. Dazu sind zahlreiche Zivilpolizisten und Ermittler des Landeskriminalamtes vor Ort – darunter insbesondere solche, die auf die Aufklärung von Sexualstraftaten spezialisiert sind. Genaue Zahlen nennt die Polizei bewusst nicht.

Für die Große Freiheit greift zudem wieder das Fluchtkonzept aus dem vergangenen Jahr: Die Nebenfahrbahn der Reeperbahn wird für den Verkehr gesperrt, auf dem Beatles-Platz und erstmals auch an der Schmuckstraße wird eine mobile Polizeiwache aufgebaut. Hinzu kommen der Einsatz von Lichtmasten am Jungfernstieg und Leuchtballons, sogenannten Power Moons, auf der Großen Freiheit.

Auch für die Hamburger Feuerwehr ist der Jahreswechsel die "härteste Nacht des Jahres", wie Sprecher Jan Ole Unger betont. 27 zusätzliche Rettungswagen und zwei weitere Drehleiterfahrzeuge sind im Einsatz. Zudem befinden sich alle Kräfte der Freiwilligen Feuerwehren im Dienst, in der Rettungsleitstelle ist jeder Platz besetzt. "Wir bringen alles auf die Straße, was wir haben", sagt Unger. Und das ist auch nötig: In der vergangenen Silvesternacht rückten die Kräfte zu mehr als 1000 Einsätzen aus.Lindner will junge kriminelle Asylbewerber abschieben

Anzeige

FDP-Chef Christian Lindner hat sich für die Abschiebung minderjähriger krimineller Asylbewerber ausgesprochen, falls das im konkreten Fall möglich ist. "Gerade bei allein eingereisten jungen Männern höre ich von vielen Problemen. Da geht es nicht nur um freundliche Fürsorge, sondern auch um erzieherische Maßnahmen. Wenn jemand dem nicht zugänglich ist, muss die Ausweisung geprüft werden", sagte er der "Bild am Sonntag". Auch unbegleitete Minderjährige könnten unter Begleitung zurückgeführt werden, wenn ihre Familie bekannt sei.

Lindner wurde nach Problemen in manchen Kommunen mit minderjährigen Flüchtlingen gefragt. Er äußerte sich aber auch vor dem Hintergrund der Bluttat in Kandel in Rheinland-Pfalz, bei der ein junger Afghane eine 15-Jährige erstochen hat. Allerdings ist unklar, ob der mutmaßliche Täter tatsächlich minderjährig ist oder eine falsche Altersangabe gemacht hat.

Kontrolle von Grenzen nicht gleichbedeutend mit Abschottung

Der FDP-Vorsitzende forderte auch eine neue Einwanderungspolitik in Europa. Dass sich Österreichs neuer Kanzler Sebastian Kurz (ÖVP) gegen illegale Einwanderung wende, sei eine Selbstverständlichkeit, sagte er. "Der Verzicht auf Regeln wäre nicht sozial oder human. Im Gegenteil würde jedes staatliche Gemeinwesen und jedes System sozialer Sicherheit zusammenbrechen." Die Kontrolle von Grenzen sei nicht gleichbedeutend mit Abschottung. Europa habe humanitäre Verpflichtungen und ein Interesse an qualifizierter Einwanderung.

Damit Rechtspopulisten nicht mit Fremdenangst Politik machen könnten, müsse man Probleme offen ansprechen, erklärte Lindner. "Unser Land bleibt nur dann tolerant und weltoffen, wenn die Menschen sich zu jeder Zeit und an jeder Stelle auf unsere Rechtsordnung verlassen können."

Lindner kritisierte erneut die Flüchtlingspolitik von Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU). Es sei unverantwortlich gewesen, dass jeder unkontrolliert habe kommen können. "Weil wir auf Regeln verzichtet haben, hat ganz Europa 2015 über die deutsche Regierung mit dem Kopf geschüttelt. Jetzt geht es darum, mit einer neuen Einwanderungspolitik in Europa dafür zu sorgen, dass die Probleme bewältigt werden", sagte Lindner.Brown was the last of the three to be sworn into office.

In a chic Kensington cafe, Roman Borisovich told WikiTribune that London is "the corruption capital of the world," estimating that the city has the highest concentration of dirty money anywhere on the planet.

The veteran anti-corruption campaigner and former Russian chief financial officer said the bulk of the hidden capital that has flooded into the UK in recent years – around £1bn a month, according to one Deutsche Bank report – is invested in property in London.

"It is much more difficult to obtain financial assets or assets other than real estate with dirty money in this country," Borisovich said. The ease of bringing massive wealth into the UK is a colonial vestige, he added, a holdover from the time when administrators would make money in India or West Africa before bringing it home.

Borisovich rose to moderate fame after starring in a 2015 Channel 4 film, From Russia With Cash, when he posed as "Boris," a corrupt Russian government minister looking to purchase upmarket properties in London's most exclusive boroughs. The exposé caused uproar when estate agents caught on hidden camera continued to work with and advise Boris, even though he repeatedly made it clear that he was apparently skimming money from government contracts.

Borisovich told WikiTribune that he helped create From Russia With Cash for "shock and awe" purposes, to highlight the ease with which foreign plutocrats can abuse the UK property market. The documentary also helped Borisovich launch an anti-corruption organization, the Committee for Legislation Against Money Laundering in Property by Kleptocrats, or ClampK.

ClampK emerged out of Borisovich's backing of Alexei Navalny, a fiery and controversial anti-corruption campaigner who has emerged as the de facto leader of the opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "In our conversations in Moscow, [Navalny] expressed bewilderment, anger even, at the fact that anonymous companies are used to hide Russian illicit wealth in London, in plain sight," Borisovich said. He added that while Navalny had been "very successful in finding corrupt Russian bureaucrats' properties in Miami, New York, and the south of France, London was a nut he couldn't crack because of the secrecy of jurisdictions."

Borisovich is careful to stress that despite his origins, ClampK does not focus exclusively on post-Soviet corruption. He leads London "kleptocracy tours" – bus rides for journalists and politicians past multi-million pound mansions allegedly purchased with dirty money. He points out that their secretive owners are not just Russian and Kazakh, but also Nigerian and Chinese.

Borisovich was keen to point out that the purchase of high-end properties by foreign billionaires, who frequently leave their properties unoccupied, isn't an issue that exists in isolation from the wider context of London housing. One consequence is the "lights-out London" (The Guardian) phenomenon, where absentee owners stifle their neighborhoods' local economies.

"If you go to some spots in central London, like Ennismore Gardens [in exclusive Knightsbridge], you see a place where 100 percent of the local economy has been killed because there are no permanent residents anymore," he said. "There used to be four pubs; there used to be 7/11s; there used to be dry-cleaners. Everything that you used, walking out of your building, there's none of that – it's completely dead. Now it's a concrete desert."

Foreign ownership also has a knock-on effect on house prices across the market. Money laundered in ritzy mansions worth tens of millions "makes price levels everywhere more expensive," Borisovich said.

Borisovich argues that some of the effects of foreign cash on the property market could be alleviated with more stringent checks on the source of money. One of ClampK's primary objectives is to challenge the attitude of the authorities, which he said is to abdicate responsibility by stating: "If their own countries don't think that they're criminals, why should we get involved?"

Yet this failure to take responsibility overlooks a crucial point about corruption in Russia, Borisovich said. "The kleptocracies of the modern age, especially absolute kleptocracies like Russia, they don't punish – they actually support their thieves." He supports a more proactive approach to money laundering: "We need to be able to judge by our own standards. If we decide this money is illegally gotten, it doesn't belong here."

ClampK is "slowly but surely" making progress on this, Borisovich said. His organization strongly supports the UK Criminal Finances Act, which received Royal Assent in April, giving the British government greater powers to probe companies suspected of money laundering. The Act also introduced "unexplained wealth orders," which require those suspected of serious crime or corruption to explain the sources of their wealth.

Borisovich said the new tools are "very powerful" and that the government is "making steps in the right direction" but the efforts are still inadequate. For example, he said that the 160 properties across the UK owned "by high corruption risk individuals, including those who have been charged and convicted with corruption offences," referenced in a Transparency International report from March, should mean grounds for immediately issuing 160 unexplained wealth orders.

Borisovich is also concerned that the UK government may be unwilling to appear hostile to potential overseas investment, even if it is ill-gotten, due to the ongoing Brexit negotiations.

Borisovich is most pessimistic on the prospects of reform in Russia. While he had only praise for his former associate Navalny, who intends to run in next year's presidential elections, he believes Navalny's candidacy is a virtual nonstarter. The anti-corruption campaigner has been barred from running due to a previous conviction for embezzlement.

Though Navalny and Borisovich remain personally on good terms, Navalny has distanced himself from ClampK. Risking too significant an association with a foreign campaign would distract from Navalny's core anti-Putin message, Borisovich said.The year is coming to an end. I did not write nearly as much as I had planned to. But I'm hoping to change that next year, with more tutorials around Reinforcement Learning, Evolution, and Bayesian Methods coming to WildML! And what better way to start than with a summary of all the amazing things that happened in 2017? Looking back through my Twitter history and the WildML newsletter, the following topics repeatedly came up. I'll inevitably miss some important milestones, so please let me know about it in the comments!

Reinforcement Learning beats humans at their own games

The biggest success story of the year was probably AlphaGo (Nature paper), a Reinforcement Learning agent that beat the world's best Go players. Due to its extremely large search space, Go was thought to be out of reach of Machine Learning techniques for a couple more years. What a nice surprise!

The first version of AlphaGo was bootstrapped using training data from human experts and further improved through self-play and an adaptation of Monte-Carlo Tree Search. Soon after, AlphaGo Zero (Nature Paper) took it a step further and learned to play Go from scratch, without human training data whatsoever, using a technique simultaneously published in the Thinking Fast and Slow with Deep Learning and Tree Search paper. It also handily beat the first version of AlphaGo. Towards the end of the year, we saw yet another generalization of the AlphaGo Zero algorithm, called AlphaZero, which not only mastered Go, but also Chess and Shogi, using the exact same techniques. Interestingly, these programs made moves that surprised even the most experienced Go players, motivating players to learn from AlphaGo and adjusting their own play style accordingly. To make this easier, DeepMind also released an AlphaGo Teach tool.

But Go wasn't the only game where we made significant progress. Libratus (Science paper), a system developed by researchers from CMU, managed to beat top Poker players in a 20-day Heads-up, No-Limit Texas Hold'em tournament. A little earlier, DeepStack, a system developed by researchers from Charles University, The Czech Technical University, and the University of Alberta, became the first to beat professional poker players. Note that both of these systems played Heads-up poker, which is played between two players and a significantly easier problem than playing at a table of multiple players. The latter will most likely see additional progress in 2018.

The next frontiers for Reinforcement Learning seem to be more complex multi-player games, including multi-player Poker. DeepMind is actively working on Starcraft 2, releasing a research environment, and OpenAI demonstrated initial success in 1v1 Dota 2, with the goal of competing in the the full 5v5 game in the near future.

Evolution Algorithms make a Comeback

For supervised learning, gradient-based approaches using the back-propagation algorithm have been working extremely well. And that isn't likely to change anytime soon. However, in Reinforcement Learning, Evolution Strategies (ES) seem to be making a comeback. Because the data typically is not iid (independent and identically distributed), error signals are sparser, and because there is a need for exploration, algorithms that do not rely on gradients can work quite well. In addition, evolutionary algorithms can scale linearly to thousands of machines enabling extremely fast parallel training. They do not require expensive GPUs, but can be trained on a large number (typically hundreds to thousands) of cheap CPUs.

Earlier in the year, researchers from OpenAI demonstrated that Evolution Strategies can achieve performance comparable to standard Reinforcement Learning algorithms such as Deep Q-Learning. Towards the end of the year, a team from Uber released a blog post and a set of five research papers, further demonstrating the potential of Genetic Algorithms and novelty search. Using an extremely simple Genetic Algorithm, and no gradient information whatsoever, their algorithm learns to play difficult Atari Games. Here's a video of the GA policy scoreing 10,500 on Frostbite. DQN, AC3, and ES score less than 1,000 on this game.

Most likely, we'll see more work in this direction in 2018.

WaveNets, CNNs, and Attention Mechanisms

Google's Tacotron 2 text-to-speech system produces extremely impressive audio samples and is based on WaveNet, an autoregressive model which is also deployed in the Google Assistant and has seen massive speed improvements in the past year. WaveNet had previously been applied to Machine Translation as well, resulting in faster training times that recurrent architectures.

The move away from expensive recurrent architectures that take long to train seems to be larger trend in Machine Learning subfields. In Attention is All you Need, researchers get rid of recurrence and convolutions entirely, and use a more sophisticated attention mechanism to achieve state of the art results at a fraction of the training costs.

The Year of Deep Learning frameworks

If I had to summarize 2017 in one sentence, it would be the year of frameworks. Facebook made a big splash with PyTorch. Due to its dynamic graph construction similar to what Chainer offers, PyTorch received much love from researchers in Natural Language Processing, who regularly have to deal with dynamic and recurrent structures that hard to declare in a static graph frameworks such as Tensorflow.

Tensorflow had quite a run in 2017. Tensorflow 1.0 with a stable and backwards-compatible API was released in February. Currently, Tensorflow is at version 1.4.1. In addition to the main framework, several Tensorflow companion libraries were released, including Tensorflow Fold for dynamic computation graphs, Tensorflow Transform for data input pipelines, and DeepMind's higher-level Sonnet library. The Tensorflow team also announced a new eager execution mode which works similar to PyTorch's dynamic computation graphs.

In addition to Google and Facebook, many other companies jumped on the Machine Learning framework bandwagon:

Apple announced its CoreML mobile machine learning library.

A team at Uber released Pyro, a Deep Probabilistic Programming Language.

Amazon announced Gluon, a higher-level API available in MXNet.

Uber released details about its internal Michelangelo Machine Learning infrastructure platform.

And because the number of framework is getting out of hand, Facebook and Microsoft announced the ONNX open format to share deep learning models across frameworks. For example, you may train your model in one framework, but then serve it in production in another one.

In addition to general-purpose Deep Learning frameworks, we saw a large number of Reinforcement Learning frameworks being released, including:

With the goal of making Deep Learning more accessible, we also got a few frameworks for the web, such as Google's deeplearn.js and the MIL WebDNN execution framework. But at least one very popular framework died. That was Theano. In an announcement on the Theano mailing list, the developers decided that 1.0 would be its last release.

Learning Resources

With Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning gaining popularity, an increasing number of lectures, bootcamps, and events have been recorded and published online in 2017. The following are some of my favorites:

Several academic conferences continued the new tradition of publishing conference talks online. If you want to catch up with cutting-edge research you can watch some of the recordings from NIPS 2017, ICLR 2017 or EMNLP 2017.

Researchers also started publishing easily accessible tutorial and survey papers on arXiv. Here are some of my favorites from this year:

Applications: AI & Medicine

2017 saw many bold claims about Deep Learning techniques solving medical problems and beating human experts. There was a lot of hype, and understanding true breakthroughs is anything but easy for someone not coming from a medical background. For an comprehensive review, I recommend Luke Oakden-Rayner's The End of Human Doctors blog post series. I will briefly highlight some developments here.

Among the top news this year was a Stanford team releasing details about a Deep learning algorithm that does as well as dermatologists in identifying skin cancer. You can read the Nature article here. Another team at Stanford developed a model which can diagnose irregular heart rhythms, also known as arrhythmias, from single-lead ECG signals better than a cardiologist.

But this year was not without blunders. DeepMind's deal with the NHS was full of "inexcusable" mistakes. The NIH released a chest x-ray dataset to the scientific community, but upon closer inspection it was found that it is not really suitable for training diagnostic AI models.

Applications: Art & GANs

Another application that started to gain more traction this year is generative modeling for images, music, sketches, and videos. The NIPS 2017 conference featured a Machine Learning for Creativity and Design workshop the first time this year.

Among the most popular applications was Google's QuickDraw, which uses a neural network to recognize your doodles. Using the released dataset you may even teach machines to finish your drawings for you.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), made significant progress this year. New models such as CycleGAN, DiscoGAN and StarGAN achieved impressive results in generating faces, for example. GANs traditionally have had difficulty generating realistic high-resolution images, but impressive results from pix2pixHD demonstrate that we're on track to solving these. Will GANs become the new paintbrush?

Applications: Self-driving cars

The big players in the self-driving car space are ride-sharing apps Uber and Lyft, Alphabet's Waymo, and Tesla. Uber started out the year with a few setbacks as their self-driving cars missed several red lights in San Francisco due to software error, not human error as had been reported previously. Later on, Uber shared details about its car visualization platform used internally. In December, Uber's self driving car program hit 2 million miles.

In the meantime, Waymo's self-driving cars got their first real riders in April, and later completely took out the human operators in Phoenix, Arizona. Waymo also published details about their testing and simulation technology.

Lyft announced that it is building its own autonomous driving hard- and software. Its first pilot in Boston is now underway. Tesla Autpilot hasn't seen much of an update, but there's a newcomer to the space: Apple. Tim Cook confirmed that Apple is working on software for self-driving cars, and researchers from Apple published a mapping-related paper on arXiv.

Applications: Cool Research Projects

So many interesting projects and demos were published this year that it's impossible to mention all of them here. However, here are a couple the stood out during the year:

And on the more research-y side:

Datasets

Neural Networks used for supervised learning are notoriously data hungry. That's why open datasets are an incredibly important contribution to the research community. The following are a few datasets that stood out this year:

Deep Learning, Reproducibility, and Alchemy

Throughout the year, several researchers raised concerns about the reproducibility of academic paper results. Deep Learning models often rely on a huge number of hyperparameters which must to be optimized in order to achieve results that are good enough to publish. This optimization can become so expensive that only companies such as Google and Facebook can afford it. Researchers do not always release their code, forget to put important details into the finished paper, use slightly different evaluation procedures, or overfit to the dataset by repeatedly optimizing hyperparameters on the same splits. This makes reproducibility a big issue. In Reinforcement Learning That Matters, researchers showed that the same algorithms taken from different code bases achieve vastly different results with high variance:

In Are GANs Created Equal? A Large-Scale Study, researchers showed that a well-tuned GAN using expensive hyperparameter search can beat more sophisticated approaches that claim to be superior. Similarly, in On the State of the Art of Evaluation in Neural Language Models, researchers showed that simple LSTM architectures, when properly regularized and tuned, can outperform more recent models.

In a NIPS talk that resonated with many researchers, Ali Rahimi compared recent Deep Learning approaches to Alchemy and called for more rigorous experimental design. Yann LeCun took it as an insult and promptly responded the next day.

Artificial Intelligence made in Canada and China

With United States immigration policies tightening, it seems that companies are increasingly opening offices overseas, with Canada being a prime destination. Google opened a new office in Toronto, DeepMind opened a new office in Edmonton, Canada, and Facebook AI Research is expanding to Montreal as well.

China is another destination that is receiving a lot of attention. With a lot of capital, a large talent pool, and government data readily available, it is competing head to head with the United States in terms of AI developments and production deployments. Google also announced that it will soon open a new lab in Beijing.

Hardware Wars: Nvidia, Intel, Google, Tesla

Modern Deep Learning techniques famously require expensive GPUs to train state-of-the-art models. So far, NVIDIA has been the big winner. This year, it announced its new Titan V flagship GPU. It comes in gold color, by the way.

But competition is increasing. Google's TPUs are now available on its cloud platform, Intel's Nervana unveiled a new set of chips, and even Tesla admitted that it is working on its own AI hardware. Competition may also come from China, where hardware makers specializing in Bitcoin mining want to enter the Artificial Intelligence focused GPU space.

Hype and Failures

With great hype comes great responsibility. What the mainstream media reports almost never corresponds to what actually happened in a research lab or production system. IBM Watson is the poster-child over overhyped marketing and failed to deliver corresponding results. This year, everyone was hating on IBM Watson, which is not surprising after its repeated failures in healthcare.

The story capturing the most hype was probably Facebook's "Researchers shut down AI that invented its own language", which I won't link to on purpose. It has already done enough damage and you can google it. Of course, the title couldn't have been further from the truth. What happened was researchers stopping a standard experiment that did not seem to give good results.

But it's not only the press that is guilty of hype. Researchers also overstepped boundaries with titles and abstracts that do not reflect the actual experiment results, such as in this natural language generation paper, or this Machine Learning for markets paper.

High-Profile Hires and Departures

Andrew Ng, the Coursera co-founder who is probably most famous for his Machine Learning MOOC, was in the news several times this year. Andrew left Baidu where he was leading the AI group in March, raised a new $150M fund, and announced a new startup, landing.ai, focused on the manufacturing industry. In other news, Gary Marcus stepped down as the director of Uber's artificial intelligence lab, Facebook hired away Siri's Natural Language Understanding Chief, and several prominent researchers left OpenAI to start a new robotics company.

The trend of Academia losing scientists to the industry also continued, with university labs complaining that they cannot compete with the salaries offered by the industry giants.

Startup Investments and Acquisitions

Just like the year before, the AI startup ecosystem was booming with several high-profile acquisitions:

... and new companies raising large sums of money:

And finally, Happy New Year! Thanks for sticking with this post for so long :)

Chinese President Xi Jinping delivers a New Year speech to extend New Year greetings to all Chinese, and best wishes to friends all over the world, in Beijing, capital of China, Dec. 31, 2017. (Xinhua)

BEIJING, Dec. 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping Sunday delivered a New Year speech, vowing that China would resolutely carry out reform in 2018.

"We will take the opportunity of celebrating the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening-up in 2018 to further carry out reform, as reform and opening-up is the path we must take to make progress in contemporary China and to realize the Chinese dream," Xi said.

He cited a Chinese adage, saying that the Chinese people would "cut paths through mountains, and build bridges across rivers" to move forward on reform.

He extended New Year greetings to all Chinese, and best wishes to friends all over the world.

Xi said the year 2018 marked the first year of fully implementing "the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC)," which outlines China's desired development blueprint over the next three decades.

"Building a high-rise begins with mounds of soil," Xi said, borrowing an ancient Chinese phrase to urge his fellow Chinese to take a step-by-step approach and work hard to turn the blueprint into a reality.

Xi said that by 2020 all rural residents living below the current poverty line should have been lifted out of poverty. It will be the first time in China's thousands of years of history that extreme poverty is eliminated.

"It is our solemn promise," Xi said. "Only three years are left to 2020. Every one of us must be called to action, do our best, take targeted measures to secure victories one after another."

"This is a great cause, important to both the Chinese nation and humanity. Let's do it together and make it happen," he said.

Xi said China's great achievement of development was made by the people and for the people, and that among the people's most pressing concerns were education, employment, income, social security, health care, elderly care, housing and environmental protection.

The president admitted that there were areas where the government's work fell short of expectations. Though progress has been made, he said, issues of public concern remain.

"That is why we should strengthen our sense of responsibility, and do a good job of ensuring the people's well-being," Xi said. "The well-being of our people is the Party and the government's greatest political achievement. Our cadres should put the people's state of living at the heart, and help them live a better life."

On international affairs, Xi said the world expected to hear China's stance and attitude on issues concerning peace and development.

"As a responsible major country, China has something to say," Xi said.

"China will resolutely uphold the authority and status of the United Nations, actively fulfill China's international obligations and duties, remain firmly committed to China's pledges to tackle climate change, actively push for the Belt and Road Initiative, and always be a builder of world peace, contributor of global development and keeper of international order," he said. "The Chinese people are ready to chart out a more prosperous, peaceful future for humanity, with people from other countries."

Xi said the convening of the 19th CPC National Congress in 2017 had embarked China on a new journey to build a modern socialist country.

Stating the achievements China made in 2017, Xi said gross domestic product had risen to 80 trillion yuan (12.3 trillion U.S. dollars); over 13 million new jobs were created; 1.35 billion people were covered by basic medical insurance; and more than 10 million rural people were lifted out of poverty.

Xi said the people's sense of fulfillment, happiness and security had grown stronger, citing the improvement of people's livelihoods, and the ecological environment in the year.

"We have taken another great step in finishing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects," Xi said.

From the Chinese-produced large passenger jet C919 to the bullet train named Fuxing -- with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour, Xi said good news kept rolling-in on sci-tech innovation and major projects in 2017.

"I applaud the Chinese people for their great creativity," he said.

Xi also spoke of a grand military parade at the Zhurihe training base in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, held to mark the 90th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army; the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland; as well as a national memorial ceremony to mark the 80th anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre.

Xi noted several multilateral diplomatic events held in China, including the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, the BRICS Xiamen Summit and the CPC in Dialogue with World Political Parties High-Level Meeting.

Xi said that he had an in-depth exchange of views with concerted parties on different occasions, such as at the World Economic Forum in Davos and the G20 Summit in Hamburg.

"They are all in favor of the joint building of a community with a shared future for humanity so as to benefit people across the world," he said.

Xi said he had received letters from people of ethnic minority regions, professor and university students.

"Their patriotism made me feel that the ordinary people are the greatest, while happiness comes out of diligence," Xi said.With 2017 drawing to a close Sunday night, Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics has released data regarding the country and its population. As 2018 begins, some 8,793,000 people currently reside in Israel. Of those residents, 6,556,000 are Jewish, making up 75 percent of the populace.

Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter



As for the country's non-Jewish population, 1,837,000 are Arabs, making up 21 percent of the total population. 400,000, meanwhile, are non-Arab Christians and people who are not classified by religion in the census, making up 4 percent of the population.

Israel's census does not include the population of foreign nationals working in the country, estimated to have been some 170,000 people at the end of 2016, or people who entered the country illegally through non-recognized border crossings.

In 2017, Israel's population grew by 165,000, with 180,000 babies born—74 percent of them Jewish, 23 percent Arabs and 3 percent non-Arab Christians or not classified by religion—and 44,000 people passing away. In addition, the 8,000 Israelis who resided abroad for more than a year were subtracted from the population.

The country also welcomed 27,000 new olim this past year, with roughly 10,000 other immigrants also coming into the country—including "olim citizens," people who were born to an Israeli citizen during their stay abroad and entered Israel intending to settle in the country. That number also includes people who immigrated to the country as part of the law permitting to do so.In 2015, Samsung introduced the Galaxy A8. A year later, it released its successor called the Galaxy A8 (2016). The company, however, skipped 2017 and decided to release the 2018 model instead. To greet the New Year, here's our review of the Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018).

Before we get started, the Galaxy A8 (2018) is just one of the two smartphones that Samsung announced in December 2017. The other one is the bigger sibling, the Galaxy A8+ (2018). The two are basically twins except for a few differences.

Design and Construction

The Galaxy A8 (2018) took cues from the design of its flagship cousins such as the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note8, meaning it sports an 18.5:9 display with a slim top and bottom bezels. It has curved corners and rounded sides but thicker and not as sleek as the Galaxy S8.

The front is dominated 5.6-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display. Placed above it is the earpiece, sensor, and two cameras consisting of a 16MP main, and 8MP wide-angle.

Placed on the left are the volume keys and the nano-SIM 1 card slot.

On the right are the power/lock button and loudspeaker.

Looking at the top we have the microphone, and another tray for the nano-SIM 2 card and microSD card slot, which is great for those who are not fond of hybrid card trays.

Down at the bottom are the USB-C port, microphone, and 3.5mm audio port.

Turn it on its back and you will see the 16MP main camera with an LED flash beside it. Below it is the horizontally-positioned fingerprint scanner. It feels weird at first since we're used to the vertical scanner on the Galaxy S8, but so far it can scan our fingerprints well and its lower placement makes it easier to reach.

In the hands, the Galaxy A8 (2018) feels thicker and heavier than the Galaxy S8. It's also a smudge magnet but still feels premium thanks to the glass front and back (no mention of Gorilla Glass) which curves towards the edges and meets the metal frame in the middle for a seamless feel. In addition, it is IP68-certified meaning, it can be submerged under 1.5m of water for 30 minutes.

Display and Multimedia

The Galaxy A8 (2018) sports a 5.6-inch Super AMOLED panel with a resolution of 1080 × 2220 or equal to 441ppi. Samsung calls this the Infinity Display but doesn't have the curved edges like the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy Note8. This leaves an impression that the device has thicker side bezels. The resolution is also fixed, unlike the Galaxy S8 that can go lower to HD+ (720 x 1480).

Quality-wise, it's vibrant, sharp, with punchy colors and wide-viewing angles. Users can choose between four different screen modes to suit their usage – Adaptive display, AMOLED cinema, AMOLED photo, and Basic, as well as adjust color balance. Sadly, the Video enhancer feature found in the Galaxy S8 is not available.

When it comes to audio, the Galaxy A8 (2018) has the loudspeaker placed on the right side which is pretty uncommon, but not a hindrance when we're listening to music. Quality is good for a smartphone as it's loud and rich with a hint of bass. If you like to binge on movies or TV series, or just casually listen to tracks on Spotify, this one will suffice.

Camera

One of the main features of the Galaxy A8 (2018) is its cameras which consists of a 16MP PDAF f/1.7 rear and 16MP FF f/1.9 + 8MP f/1.9 front. This makes the Galaxy A8 (2018) Samsung's first smartphone to sport dual front cameras.

Features include Bixby Vision which can identify an object or location as well as extract or translate texts. It has Stickers, Pro mode, Panorama, Hyperlapse, Night mode, and Food. You can download a few more camera features from the Galaxy Apps.

Images produced by the rear camera is quite good with plenty of details and accurate colors. The Phase Detect Autofocus is more than adequate for different shooting scenarios while the f/1.7 wide aperture helps gather more light in dim environments. Sadly, there's no optical stabilization, but it's not really a huge disadvantage.

For the front cameras, the 16MP FF f/1.9 (standard angle) + 8MP f/1.9 (wide-angle) configuration makes the device a versatile selfie shooter. If you want an ordinary selfie you can use the main 16MP camera, but if you want to have a selfie with a group, you can simply switch to the 8MP wide-angle.

The dual-front cameras also feature the Live Focus which adds blur to the subject's background and lets you readjust the focus after taking the shot. Not only that, it also has a Beauty effect if you want to look better on your selfies, and screen flash for selfies in the dark. For a fixed-focus camera, images produced are sharp with vibrant colors and nicely implemented beauty and Live Focus effects. It can get smudgy though in dim environments.

When it comes to video recording, the Galaxy A8 (2018) maxes out at 1080p at 30fps with video stabilization. Quality is okay but autofocus is jittery. Check out the sample video below.

OS, UI, and Apps

Running the software department is Android 7.1.1 with Samsung Experience 8.5. It's a bit of a downer considering that Oreo is already available for many devices, but also expected considering that Samsung is still testing Oreo for the Galaxy S8/S8+.

If you have handled a Galaxy S8/S8+ before, the experience and layout are pretty much similar. Icons are the same but are loaded with new wallpapers for you to use. There's Smart stay which keeps the screen on while you're looking at it, One-handed mode, Finger sensor gestures, Quick launch camera, Multi-window, and Device Maintenance. The Dual Messenger feature found on the Galaxy Note8 makes it way here as well, allowing you use two separate accounts for the same app.

Bixby is present as well which can be accessed by swiping from the left of the home screen. It's not the full package though, unlike the one found on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note8. Voice apps and services are not available and are just limited to Bixby Home which shows you a summary of your day, weather, and news, Bixby Vision for the camera, and Bixby Reminder.

When it comes to apps, it has Google apps pre-installed as well as Microsoft's productivity suite like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and one OneDrive. The rest are Samsung's native apps like Samsung Health, S Voice, Galaxy Apps, Samsung Members, Samsung 321 and Smart Tutor.

All in all, this leaves the device with 24.38GB of usable space out of the 32GB. It would have been nicer if Samsung equipped this with 64GB instead considering the price. On the bright side, the Galaxy A8 (2018) features a triple card slot, which lets you expand the memory with a microSD card without having to sacrifice dual-SIM functionality.

Performance and Benchmarks

The Galaxy A8 (2018) is powered by an Exynos 7885 octa-core chipset, consisting of 2.2GHz dual-core and 1.6GHz hexa-core processors and Mali-G71 GPU, coupled with 4GB of RAM. It scored 78,256 in AnTuTu which is better than most mid-range smartphones on the market.

Performance is good as we never experienced any hang-ups, lags, crashes, or overheating. We played Mobile Legends, Arena of Valor, and Vainglory in their highest settings and the device was able to keep up. Warming can be felt at the center back but not too much to be a cause for concern. Check out the rest of the scores below:

Connectivity and Call Quality

Users won't have about connectivity as the Galaxy A8 (2018) has everything covered from Dual-SIM 4G LTE Cat.11, WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac (2.4/5GHz), Bluetooth 5.0, ANT+, NFC, USB-C with OTG function, and GPS. It is also packed with a bunch of sensors including Gyroscope and Barometer.

Mobile data is fast as long as the LTE signal is good, GPS works great on Google Maps, Waze, Grab, and Uber. Call quality is good thanks to noise-canceling.

Battery Life

The Galaxy A8 (2018) is equipped with a 3,000mAh battery which is an average capacity of today's standard. This may seem small for some but we actually got good mileage, lasting us for a whole day and night with a little left in the morning. PC Mark rated its battery at an impressive 12 hours, performing better than the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note8 at 9 hours and 30 minutes.

Our video loop test, on the other hand, which involves playing a 1080p clip on loop in Airplane mode at 50% brightness and volume with headset plugged in, yielded 18 hours and 30 minutes of playback which is good. We're glad to know that Fast Charging is supported and we were able to replenish its battery in just 2 hours.

Conclusion

With the Galaxy A8 (2018), Samsung has successfully brought the design and features normally found in their premium offerings to the upper mid-range category. If we're going to place it somewhere, it's between mid-range and flagship. It has nice Infinity Display, good performance and cameras, water and dust-resistant body, and long battery life. At Php26,990, it's more expensive than most mid-range devices, but if you can afford its asking price, you won't be disappointed.

The Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) will be available in Gold and Black colors. It will launch in the Philippines in last week of January with a free 5,000mAh Capdase Battery Pack worth Php1,199.

President Trump has delivered on a number of promises for his base. But there was an impressive amount of breakage along the way.

You might say he President Trump did as much demolition as he did construction.

The press is doing a good job of telling us what he accomplished in 2017. But they keep leaving out all the stuff he broke that probably needed to be broken.

I'll fix that for you here.

GOP – Trump broke the GOP and reconstructed it along his terms, successfully it seems.

DNC – The DNC has no charismatic leader, no game plan, and little money.

Clinton Dynasty – Done

Bush Dynasty – Done

Mainstream Media – The public learned that news coverage is based on bias as much as fact.

FBI (leadership) – The FBI as a whole is still highly credible, but the leadership is not.

Pundits – Nearly all the pundits were wrong about Trump's nomination, election, and successful (by Republican standards) first year.

Government Regulations – For good or bad, we have fewer regulations now.

Hollywood – Big stars are alienating 40% of their potential audience whenever they take time off from groping.

North Korea – They used to have a pathetic but functioning economy. That situation is changing rapidly.

ISIS – Remember ISIS? They used to be a big deal.

TPP – Pulled out

Paris Climate Accord – Pulled out

Reality – I told you in 2015 that candidate Trump would change more than politics. I told you he would change the way we saw reality. Do you remember when you thought the news reported facts and that humans used those facts to make reasoned decisions? You probably don't think that anymore.

I'm probably leaving out some stuff that got broken. It's been a busy year.

The first experts who sign up will get preferential search rankings. See details here.On the fourth day of "spontaneous" protests to sweep Iran just days after Israel, Saudi Arabia and the US reached a secret agreement to do everything in their power to destabilize the Iranian government by diplomatic means or otherwise, Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard Corps vowed to "crush dissent" and take tough action if the unrest continued.

Protesters "must certainly know that improper behavior will be to their detriment, and the nation will come out and stand against these actions and throw a hard punch in their faces," the Revolutionary Guard's commander for security in Tehran, Brigadier General Esmail Kowsari, said according to THE semi-official Iranian Students' News Agency late Saturday.

The threat from the IRGC came a day after Iranian authorities blocked the nation's internet, interrupted the main networks, and restricted access to the country's most popular social media platform, Signal, in response to one of the biggest shows of dissent against its leadership in years, in which as we reported yesterday two people were killed in clashes with security forces in the western city of Dorud, the first casualties since anti-government protests erupted on Thursday. The deputy governor of Lorestan province blamed foreign agents for the deaths.

"No shots were fired by the police and security forces. We have found evidence of enemies of the revolution, Takfiri groups and foreign agents in this clash," Habibollah Khojastehpour said on state television. Takfiri is a term for extreme Sunni militants such as Islamic State.

Protesters also attacked banks and government buildings and burned police vehicles.

Protesters defied the police and Revolutionary Guards who have used violence to crush previous unrest. The demonstrations could be more worrying for authorities because they seem spontaneous and lack a clear leader... Almost as if the protests were organized from abroad.

As Bloomberg notes, the rare public challenge to the government and the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, "has erupted at a time of deepened strains between Iran and the U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed additional sanctions on Tehran and threatened to quit Iran's 2015 nuclear accord with world powers." It also "surprisingly" comes days after we reported that "US And Israel Reach "Secret Plan" To Counter Iran", and one month after Israel said it was "Ready To Share Intel With Saudis "Against Iran" Ahead Of Possible War", and also a ""Bombshell" Leaked Secret Israeli Cable Confirmed Israeli-Saudi Coordination To Provoke War with Iran."

Almost as if the events are connected...

Meanwhile, in another Twitter post on the unrest Sunday, Trump said, "The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism." The president also added that it "[l]ooks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations!" Violations which the CIA may or may not have been itching to tweet it was sponsoring.

Big protests in Iran. The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. Looks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2017

In any case, the protests which began in the northeastern city of Mashhad, initially targeted the government's handling of the economy, winning the backing of hardliners critical of President Hassan Rouhani and the nuclear deal. But it took less than a day for the focus to shift to the religious establishment and state security forces close to the hardliners.

By Saturday, unverified video footage shared on Iran's Telegram social media site, Twitter and Instagram from several cities across the country showed demonstrators calling for Khamenei's ouster.

Meanwhile, demonstrations, which extended to at least 20 locations over the past week, continued into their fourth day on Sunday. An Iranian reached by telephone told Reuters that there was a heavy presence of police and security forces in central Tehran.

"I saw a few young men being arrested and put into police van. They don't let anyone assemble," he said.

Video from earlier days posted on social media showed people chanting: "Mullahs, have some shame, leave the country alone."

The demonstrators also shouted: "Reza Shah, bless your soul". Such calls are evidence of a deep level of anger and break a taboo. The king ruled Iran from 1925 to 1941 and his Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown in a revolution in 1979 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic's first leader.

Confirming the crackdown on internet services in the country, Telegram's chief executive, Pavel Durov, wrote on Twitter that Iranian authorities are blocking access "for the majority of Iranians." The move came after the company refused to shut down a number of "peacefully protesting channels," Durov said.

With reports coming in that #Telegram, #instagram and #Twitter are all complying with the Iranian regime's censorship requests, @durov, @jack and @kevin are all in potential violation of U.S. law and will be remembered by history for the choices they make. — Richard Goldberg (@rich_goldberg) December 31, 2017

The recent demonstrations are among the largest seen since in the Islamic Republic since millions of Iranians took to the streets to protest the disputed re-election of hardline former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009.

Government officials say the latest unrest is part of a wider attempt by Rouhani's opponents to discredit his leadership. Iran's hardline media have said justified criticism of the government has been hijacked by a wider foreign plot to sow sedition in the country.

As noted above, Iran's elite armed forces, the Revolutionary Guard, warned late Saturday that it would respond with "a hard punch" if demonstrations didn't stop.

Earlier over the weekend, videos on social media showed protesters in the city of Shiraz tearing down a banner of Qassem Soleimani, the powerful head of the Quds Force, the branch of the IRGC that overseas operations in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, and successfully defended the Assad regime against a 6 year proxy war meant to change the Syrian regime.

Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi said some of the arrested protesters have confessed "they were carried away by emotions and set fire to mosques and public buildings" and said they will face heavy punishment for the crimes. "After giving thousands of martyrs for the revolution, the nation will not return to dark era of Pahlavi rule," he said.

Ahmad Khatami, a hardline cleric who leads Friday prayers in the capital Tehran, called for capital punishment for those chanting slogans against the values of the Islamic Republic, according to Reuters.

In apparent response to the protests, the government backed down on plans to raise fuel prices, promised to increase cash handouts to the poor and create more jobs in coming years.

"We predict that at least 830,000 jobs will be created in the new year," government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said on state television on Saturday night. He gave no details. Around 3.2 million Iranians are jobless.

Iranians also expressed anger over their country's costly interventions in Syria and Iraq where it is engaged in a proxy war for influence against regional rival Saudi Arabia.

Having officially avoided the protests since they stated, later on Sunday Iran's president Rouhani would address the nation in a televised speech, his first public comments since the unrest broke out, ISNA reported.

#Iran blocks social media amid continuing protests. @Rouhani_ir reportedly to address nation tonight. — Steve Herman (@W7VOA) December 31, 2017

The country's unrest also hit Iran's stock exchange. The TEDPIX Index fell 1.7% to 95,561.58 in Tehran on Sunday, the lowest level since Dec. 20, according to Bloomberg.A confidential document found on Anthony Weiner's laptop reveals that the United States Embassy in Stockholm, Sweden expressed concerns in 2010 that WikiLeaks would release classified US documents related to Sweden ahead of the September 19 Swedish election, tipping the vote towards the Pirate Party. The subject of the cable reads "Wikileaks: The Pirate Party's White Horse Into Sweden's Parliament?"

On June 29, 2010 a US diplomat met with three members of the Pirate Party - which is described in the cable as a "mixture between communism and libertarianism," yet whose members are "well-salaried professionals, independent from the party for income." Two of the "pirates," according to the report, were active in the "youth branch of the conservative party currently leading government."

The Embassy cable notes the "grim electoral outlook for Pirates" - as confirmed by a Pirate party member interviewed by the US diplomat, "Unless WikiLeaks Saves the Day."

Two weeks after the cable was sent, an arrest warrant was issued for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on sexual assault allegations - which was dropped, then re-issued, then revoked again by Swedish authorities in August 2015 when they dropped their case against him.

Cable found on Anthony Weiner's Laptop, obtained via Judicial Watch FOIA lawsuit

The emergence of this confidential document (found on Anthony Weiner's laptop and sent while his wife, Huma Abedin, was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's Deputy Chief of Staff), is disturbing - as it potentially implicates the Obama administration in a conspiracy to silence Julian Assange while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State - not to mention that it could be the smoking gun in yet another clear case of mishandled information found on imprisoned sexual deviant Anthony Weiner's laptop the FBI's Peter Strzok and crew must have somehow overlooked.

A brief timeline of events:

On August 20, 2010, the Swedish Prosecutor's Office issued an arrest warrant for Julian Assange over a rape allegation - two weeks after the US Embassy met with the Pirate party and had concerns over Assange leaking US secrets. The net day, Swedish cancelled the warrant. "I don't think there is reason to suspect that he has committed rape," says one of Stockholm's chief prosecutors, Eva Finne. Swedish prosecutors did however continue to investigate a separate allegation of molestation, though they felt it was not a serious enough crime for an arrest warrant.

On September 1, 2010, Swedish Director of Prosecution, Marianne Ny, reopened the rape investigation against Assange.

On November 18, 2010, Stockholm District Court approved a detention request for Mr. Assange, who had traveled to London. Two days later, Swedish police issued an international arrest warrant. On December 8, 2010, Assange is taken into British custody and taken to an extradition hearing. Eight days later, Assange posts bail and walks free in London until May 30, 2012 when the UK Supreme Court rules that he should be extradited to Sweden.

August 16, 2012, Assange begins his asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London - where he has remained for over five years.

In February, 2016, a UN panel found Assange to be detained unlawfully in the Ecuadorian embassy.

Julian Assange holding UN decision

In May, 2017, Swedish authorities once again dropped their case against Julian Assange, with his Swedish lawyer Per Samuelsson told Swedish media "It is a total victory for Julian Assange," adding "He is free to leave the embassy whenever he wants."

Unfortunately, that's not going to be quite so easy for the time being - as Assange faces immediate arrest by the UK for skipping bail in his extradition hearing. Moreover, in April of this year, CNN and the Washington Post simultaneously reported that Attorney General Jeff Sessions' DOJ has prepared criminal charges against Assange over 2010 leaks of diplomatic cables and military documents.

While the DOJ seems intent on locking Assange up, the WikiLeaks founder has also received tremendous support from certain members of congress.

As we reported last week, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher travelled to London in August with journalist Charles Johnson for a meeting with Assange, where Rohrabacher said the WikiLeaks founder offered "firsthand" information proving that the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia, and which would refute the Russian hacking theory.

Rohrabacher brought that message back to Trump's Chief of Staff, John Kelly, to propose a deal. In exchange for a presidential pardon, Assange would share evidence that would refute the Russian hacking theory by proving they weren't the source of the emails, according to the WSJ.

However - when Trump was asked in late September about the Assange proposal, he responded that he'd "never heard" of it, causing Rohrabacher to unleash on John Kelly, who he blamed for blocking the proposal from reaching the President. Rohrabacher told the Daily Caller:

"I think the president's answer indicates that there is a wall around him that is being created by people who do not want to expose this fraud that there was collusion between our intelligence community and the leaders of the Democratic Party," Rohrabacher told The Daily Caller Tuesday in a phone interview. "This would have to be a cooperative effort between his own staff and the leadership in the intelligence communities to try to prevent the president from making the decision as to whether or not he wants to take the steps necessary to expose this horrendous lie that was shoved down the American people's throats so incredibly earlier this year," Rohrabacher said.

Contributing to the notion of deep-state interference, CIA director Mike Pompeo referred to WikiLeaks as a "hostile intelligence service" in April, calling Julian Assange "a fraud, a coward hiding behind a screen" for exposing information about democratic governments rather than authoritarian regimes. This quite the ironic statement, considering Pompeo used leaked emails from WikiLeaks as proof "the fix was in" against President Trump.

So - while the Swedish authorities have dropped their case against Assange, and the UN says he's been unlawfully detailed - the UK insists on arresting Assange the moment he steps outside the Ecuadorian embassy for jumping bail on the dropped charges, and the US Department of Justice is reportedly prepared to slap criminal charges on Assange.

Perhaps the establishment is still a bit miffed that the "white wizard" showed the world what's really underneath the pantsuit, which despite the constant rhetoric of the past year is what ultimately cost Hillary - and so many of her charitable friends - the election.ADVERTISEMENT

Ever since the days of the ancient Greek, people were puzzled by the fact that apparently, hippos sweat blood; this belief propagated for more than a millenium.

Now, we know that the thick red substance, which oozes from glands all over its skin, is one of the hippo's many ingenious survival tools. Thing is, hippos are very routine-dependent animals: they spend most of the night eating (literally as much as they can), and when dawn hits, they retire into water and spend their days resting and digesting. Of course, when you want the day off to chill and digest, Sun is a big enemy, so you want some kind of UV protection. But something like fur isn't the best option when you spend so much time in water, so hippos came up with something else: an anti-UV secretion, which is at first colourless, then red, then finally brown as the pigment polymerizes.

ADVERTISEMENT

There are two different pigments, both which act as sunscreen, but one of them actually being a very effective antibiotic. At concentrations even lower than that found on the hippo's skin, it can inhibit the growth of two types of pathogenic bacteria – this is particularly good, because hippos often fight, gaining some nasty open woods which are prone to infection.So word must have gotten out at work that I had a few minutes of spare time in the evening as it seems since my last update my work load has been grown exponentially. Despite the lame hours away from home and family I have been slowly chipping away at my undead team and have a status update for everybody.

First up is some updated shots of my skeletons and zombies. I was able to get the models based with static grass and finished up some of the minor details like blood oozing out of the zombies. I am missing numbers still as I am not sure what route I am going with on them. I ordered up some custom-ish numbers from Bedlam Creations going with white numbers with an orange outline. These would work perfect with the models except that not all models have open spots available on them for numbers. I did get a number 1 onto a skeleton but the number 'plate' had a rather inconvenient whole in the middle of the plate that swallowed the number. I may resort to going with number bases, which is fine, but either way I'll be saving the transfer work till last. On to the near complete models!

Forgive the changes in color tones on the models. I'm using my IPhone for a camera and I am having a tough time getting consistent results so I had to use some editing on the brightness to get the pictures to show up decent. Overall I am pleased with the outcome of the models. The white tone on the pants for the skeletons was a bit off do to me trying to get the desired look, but on the table it doesn't look very noticeable. With the meat shields finished I moved on to the ghouls.

As far as this team is concerned I think the ghouls are packed full with some very challenging details. Between their large number of straps and long nails they were certainly a rewarding challenge to paint. My main concern at first was what color to go with on the skin. GW has lately gone with an almost white color but I thought that would clash with the white pants. Grey was suggested, and while that would compliment the orange on the uniforms, I instead opted for a very pale flesh color. It worked well in the end although my one area of complaint was the claws. I attempted to give them a dirty appearance but I think there was too much contrast in the colors. Here they are in their 90% completion.

Since they are not wearing helmets I opted to do the stich work on the fabric in white to give a similar nod to the white stripe on the helmets on the skeletons and zombies.

All the stripes on the pants where hand painted on which is a bit of a challenge when there is a lot of folds in the fabric

The ghoul above reminds me of the scarecrow from Batman so I left the eye holes in his mask extra dark to make him more sinister.

You may have noticed that a few of the ghouls brought extra hands with them on their belts. I'll probably add a little blood technical paint and then get the static grass on. Although these models where a challenge to paint I feel that they are perhaps the best sculpted models on the team. While a bit of a manicure may be in order, I like these models a lot and I can't wait to see them on the pitch.

The remaining models I think should go quicker than these four. The Flesh golems and Mummies are so large that their details should be easy to paint and the Wights seem to be a rather straight forward to paint with the only question being to have the cloaks be orange or white. Unfortunately I am going to be out of the country soon so I may only get one more update in before this project will get shelved.

Expanding further into South Florida, Foozo is opening up a second, brand new location in Bay Harbour Islands, minutes from Bal Harbour and the strip of kosher restaurants in Surfside. (see map below)

This new location is set to open in about a week.

Foozo is potentially one of the better kosher pizzerias in the country, offering not just pizzas, but an array of top quality items (see menu inclusions below) that most kosher pizzerias largely ignore.

They are known for their high-end, innovative pizzas, pastas, salads, and friendly service. Foozo's menu items include Foozballs (cheesy arancini balls), truffle parmesan fries, a whole slew of pizzas including the "White Hot" (White sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Ricotta, Goat cheese, roasted mushrooms, roasted garlic, banana peppers, sea salt topping), "Sabich" (Fresh tomato, roasted eggplant, red onion, boiled egg, banana peppers, topped with tahini sauce), and "The Foozo" (Fresh Mozzarella, Ricotta cheese, pesto sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, black olives, red onions); as well as Foozolis (similar to pizza rolls; Salads which are plentiful and fresh including their Caesar, Sweet Kale, Arugula, Santorini, and others; and their Pastas which include Baked Tony (Rigatoni, house made marinara, ricotta, shredded mozzarella finished in the wood fire pizza), Cheesy Mac (Cavatappi, house white sauce, mozzarella, Parmesan....finished in the wood fire oven), Tartufo Gemelli (white sauce, wild mushroom topped with truffle oil and arugula), and others.

Hours of operation are Sunday-Thursday 11:30AM–10PM, Friday 11:30AM–3PM. Closed Saturday.
